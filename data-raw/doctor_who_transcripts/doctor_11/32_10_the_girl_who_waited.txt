**The Girl Who Waited**  
  
Original Airdate: 10 Sep, 2011  

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Apalapucia.  
AMY: Say it again?  
DOCTOR: Apalapucia.  
AMY Apalapu  
DOCTOR: Chia.  
RORY: Apalapucia.  
DOCTOR: Apalapucia.  
AMY: Apalapucia. What a beautiful word.  
DOCTOR: Beautiful word, beautiful world. Apalapucia, voted number two planet
in the top ten greatest destinations for the discerning intergalactic
traveller.  
RORY: Why couldn't we go to number one?  
DOCTOR: It's hideous. Everyone goes to number one. Planet of the coffee shops.
Apalapucia. I give you sunsets, spires, soaring silver colonnades. I give you  
(The Doctor opens the Tardis door to reveal - a white space with a door.)  
RORY: Doors.

**[White space]**

DOCTOR: Doors. Yes. I give you doors. But on the other side of those doors, I
give you sunsets, spires, soaring silver colonnades.  
AMY: Have you seen my phone?  
DOCTOR: Your phone?  
AMY: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: Your mobile telephone? I bring you to a paradise planet, two billion
light years from Earth, and you want to update Twitter.  
AMY: Sunsets, spires, soaring silver colonnades. It's a camera phone.  
DOCTOR: On the counter, by the DVDs.  
AMY: Thank you.  
RORY: How do we get in?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. Push a button.  
(There is a choice of two - Green Anchor and Red Waterfall. Rory presses the
Green.)

**[Green Anchor room]**

(Still stark white decor, with a glass table and three avante guarde chairs.)  
DOCTOR: Okay, so rain check on the soaring silver colonnades.  
RORY: Yeah. It's a magnifying glass.  
(And it is in the middle of the table.  
(Amy comes out of the Tardis with her phone.)  
AMY [OC]: Hey? Hey, it's locked.  
RORY: Yeah, push the button.  
(Of course, she presses the Red Waterfall button.)

**[Red Waterfall room]**

(Identical to Green Anchor except there are no people here.)  
AMY: Rory?

**[Green Anchor room]**

RORY: Come on, Amy.

**[Red Waterfall room]**

(The door shuts.)  
AMY: Great.

**[Green Anchor room]**

(Rory opens the door.)  
RORY: Where is she? Where on wherever we are is my wife?  
(The Doctor presses the green button on the magnifying glass. Amy looks into
the glass in her room and the Doctor sees her.)  
DOCTOR: Rory, I think I've found her.  
RORY: What do you mean you've found her? Whoa. No, but, she's not, she's not
here.

**[Red Waterfall room]**

RORY [in glass]: I can see her, but she's not here.

**[Green Anchor room]**

AMY [in glass]: Where am I? In fact, where are you?  
(A white robot enters. It has a blank face, one red and one green button on
its torso, and is holding up a hand.)  
RORY: Whoa.  
DOCTOR: Hands. Hello, hands. Robot with hands, Rory.  
HANDBOT: Welcome to the Twostreams facility. Will you be visiting long?  
AMY [in glass]: Er, Doctor, something's happening.  
(The image in the glass starts to wiggle.)  
DOCTOR: Er, Amy? Stay calm. Stay still. Ah, time's gone wobbly. I hate it when
it does that.  
HANDBOT: Will you be visiting long?  
RORY: Good question. Bit sinister. What's the answer to not get us killed?  
DOCTOR: It's okay, I've got you, you're fine.

**[Red Waterfall room]**

ROBOT [OC]: Will you be visiting long?  
RORY [in glass]: Doctor? A little help, Doctor.  
AMY: And where have you been?

**[Green Anchor room]**

RORY: What do I tell it?  
AMY [in glass]: I've been here a week.

**[Red Waterfall room]**

DOCTOR [in glass]: A week?

**[Green Anchor room]**

DOCTOR: A week? I'm so sorry. Ah-ha. Same room, different times. Two different
timestreams running parallel but at different speeds. Amy, you're in a faster
timestream.

**[Red Waterfall room]**

AMY: Doctor, it's going again.

**[Green Anchor room]**

RORY: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Amy!  
AMY [in glass]: Doctor!

**[Red Waterfall room]**

DOCTOR [in glass]: Come on. Gotcha. There. Stabilised, settled, shush.

**[Green Anchor room]**

RORY: Why has this got hands?  
DOCTOR: Organic skin. Ultimate universal interface, grown and grafted, not
born. I mean, it's actually seeing with its fingers, scanning the room. But
why not just give it eyes?  
HANDBOT: Will you be visiting long?  
DOCTOR: As long as it takes.

**[Red Waterfall room]**

DOCTOR [in glass]: Amy, what exactly did you do?  
AMY: I just, I came in

**[Green Anchor room]**

AMY [in glass]: And I pressed the door button.  
RORY: Oh.

**[Red Waterfall room]**

RORY [in glass]: Amy, there are two buttons. The green anchor and the red
waterfall.

**[Green Anchor room]**

RORY: Which one did you push?  
AMY [in glass]: I pushed the red waterfall.  
RORY: Great.

**[White space]**

(Rory goes outside, lets the door close and presses Red Waterfall. The door
opens on an empty room.)  
RORY: Amy?  
(He steps back, the door closes and he presses Green Anchor.)

**[Green Anchor room]**

RORY: I pressed Red Waterfall, and she wasn't there.  
DOCTOR: Okay, so you can't follow her directly. You know, it's never simple.
Did you hear that, Handbot? She pressed the wrong button, that's all. We're
aliens, we didn't know.  
HANDBOT: Statement rejected. Apalapucia is under planet-wide quarantine. This
is a kindness facility for those infected with Chen Seven.  
(The Doctor covers his mouth and nose with his coat lapel.)  
DOCTOR: What?  
RORY: Chen Seven, hmm?  
DOCTOR: The one day plague.  
RORY: What, you get it for a day?  
DOCTOR: No, you get it, and you die in a day.  
HANDBOT: There are forty thousand residents in the Twostreams Facility. Please
remain in the sterile areas. Visiting hours are now.  
(The Handbot beams itself away.)  
DOCTOR: Sterile area. I'm safe.

**[Red Waterfall room]**

AMY: What about me?

**[Green Anchor room]**

DOCTOR: Chen Seven only affects two-hearted races like Apalapucians.

**[Red Waterfall room]**

RORY [in glass]: And Time Lords.  
DOCTOR [in glass]: Yeah, like me. Walk into that facility, I'm dead in a day.

**[Green Anchor room]**

DOCTOR: Time moves faster on Amy's side of the glass.

**[Red Waterfall room]**

DOCTOR [in glass]: Amy, you said you'd been here a week. What did you eat?

**[Green Anchor room]**

AMY [in glass]: Nothing. I wasn't hungry.

**[Red Waterfall room]**

DOCTOR [in glass]: No, because that Red Waterfall time is compressed. That's
the point. The Time Glass syncs up the

**[Green Anchor room]**

DOCTOR: Two timestreams for visits. You could be in here for a day, and watch
them live out their entire lives.  
RORY: And watch them grow old in front of your eyes?

**[Red Waterfall room]**

RORY [in glass]: That's horrible.

**[Green Anchor room]**

DOCTOR: No, Rory, it's kind. You've got a choice. Sit by their

**[Red Waterfall room]**

DOCTOR [in glass]: Bedside for twenty four hours and watch them die, or sit in
here for twenty four hours and watch them live. Which would you choose?  
(The Doctor pulls the Time Glass out of the table. Amy's one vanishes.)  
AMY: Doctor? Doctor, no, don't leave me.

**[Green Anchor room]**

DOCTOR: I'm here, Amy. I'm right here.  
AMY [in glass]: Where are you? Am I looking at you?  
DOCTOR: Turn left just a fraction. Bit more. Stop. That's it.  
AMY [in glass]: Eye to eye?  
DOCTOR: Eye to eye to eye.  
RORY: Hello.  
DOCTOR: Amy, I'm taking the Time Glass back to the Tardis. Like satnav, I'll
use it to get a lock, then smash through using the Tardis to get you out.
Until then, you're on your own.  
(The Doctor sonicks the glass.)  
RORY: Er, what are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Locking it on to Amy. Small act of vandalism. No one'll mind.  
(An alarm sounds.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, that'll be the small act of vandalism alarm. Amy, I need you to go
into the facility just for a bit. Find somewhere safe and leave me a sign.
Remember, you're immune to Chen Seven, but don't let them give you anything.
They don't know you're alien. Their kindness will kill you. Now go.  
(Amy presses a button labelled Check In.)  
AMY [in glass]: Rory, I love you. Now save me. Go on.  
(Through the check-in door, she is sprayed with a gas.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: This is locked onto Amy permanently. Play the signal into the console,
the Tardis'll follow it. Now then, I know you're in here.  
(The Doctor rummages through a tool box.)  
DOCTOR: Er, er, ha ha! How do I look?  
(The Doctor has found a pair of thick rimmed glasses.)  
RORY: Ridiculous.  
DOCTOR: Glasses are cool, see?  
(He puts them on Rory.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Hello, handsome man.  
RORY: Oh, hello.  
DOCTOR: Hello, Rory-cam.  
RORY: Huh?  
(The image of the Doctor is on the Time Glass.)  
RORY: Oh, you can see what I see.  
DOCTOR: We're breaking into Twostreams. Now, I can't go in there. The Chen
Seven'll kill me, no regeneration. You will be my eyes and ears.  
RORY: Rory-cam. Rescue Amy. Got it.  
DOCTOR: That's the spirit. Now, smashing through a timewall could get a bit
hairy.  
RORY: Is it safe?  
DOCTOR: Don't know. Never tried. Best hold onto something.

**[Check in area]**

(Massive, white and deserted.)  
AMY: What the?  
(She is grabbed by a beam of light from a panel in the ceiling. It has a
pleasant female voice.)  
INTERFACE: Welcome to the Twostreams Facility.  
AMY: Er, who are you and why can't I see you?  
INTERFACE: I am the Interface between yourself and the systems of the
Twostreams Facility. I will be your guide, your teacher, your friend.  
(An image of a woman appears at a check in desk.)  
CHECK IN GIRL: Welcome to Twostreams. What is your name, please?  
AMY: Amy. Amy Pond.  
CHECK IN GIRL: Welcome, Amy Pond. I see you're travelling alone. As a
resident, you will now have access to all of the entertainment zones inside.
For a taste of adventure, why not try the mountain zone, and explore
Apalapucia's famous Glasmir Mountains. Or try our roller-coaster zone,
authentically modelled on the famous Warpspeed Death Ride at Disneyland, Clom.
All that you could wish for and more is through the Departure Gate, provided
for you with kindness.

**[Arrivals area]**

INTERFACE: Unexpected visitor. Welcome. Please seek assistance.  
(A Handbot is up ahead.)  
AMY: Hello? Hey. Oi, wait.  
(The Handbot turns and scans her.)  
HANDBOT: You are carrying unregistered bacteria. Please let me help you.  
AMY: No, I'm not from this world. Your medicine'll kill me.  
HANDBOT: Statement rejected. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.  
(Amy ducks and hides.)  
AMY: No, no, please, I hate needles.  
HANDBOT: Secondary delivery system engaged.  
(It's head opens to reveal a needle gun. It misses its target and more
Handbots beam in.)  
HANDBOT: Unauthorised infection on check-in, version two two three.  
(Amy jumps over a counter and gets into the service area.)

**[Service corridor]**

INTERFACE: Unauthorised resident detected.  
(Amy hides from a Handbot.)  
AMY: Come on.  
HANDBOT: This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.  
(And the chase is on.)  
INTERFACE: Unauthorised resident detected. Unauthorised resident detected.  
AMY: No. No, no.  
HANDBOT: This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. This is a
kindness. Do not be alarmed.  
(Amy pulls at a mesh screen around a vent.)  
AMY: Come on, please.  
(She gets inside.)  
HANDBOT: No residents detected. No residents detected.  
AMY: They didn't see me. They didn't see me.

**[Tardis]**

RORY: Red Waterfall. We made it.  
DOCTOR: Good old us.

**[Red Waterfall corridor]**

RORY; How do we know that we're in the same Red Waterfall as Amy?

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Focus on the positive.

**[Red Waterfall corridor]**

(Rory looks at a topless Greek-style statue of a lady.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: We locked onto Amy's timestream.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Eyes front, soldier.

**[Red Waterfall corridor]**

RORY: Right, yes. Sorry.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Apalapucians are the great cultural scavengers, Rory. This gallery's a
scrapbook of their favourite places.

**[Red Waterfall corridor]**

(Mona Lisa on a pedestal.)  
RORY: Bit of Earth, bit of alien, bit of whatever the hell that is.

**[Gate Room]**

(With several free standing portals and a central control column.)  
AMY: Interface?  
INTERFACE: I am here, Amy Pond.  
AMY: Shush, shush. Turn that light off. So I'm, what is this? How does it
work?  
INTERFACE: This is the Gate. From here you may depart to any of Twostreams'
entertainment zones.  
(Amy presses buttons on the central column.)  
INTERFACE: Cinema. Aquarium. Garden.  
AMY: Garden? Why not?  
INTERFACE: Garden.  
(The Iconian Portal flickers with light, then Amy runs through.)

**[Garden]**

(Amy runs onto a terrace.)  
AMY: That is beautiful. I mean, freaky hedges.  
INTERFACE: The perfect replica of a Shill Governor's Mansion on Shallanna.  
AMY: You really could spend a lifetime in here. Not that I'm going to.
Interface?  
INTERFACE: Amy Pond?  
AMY: Listen, I need somewhere safe to hide and wait for my friends. Where in
Twostreams is safe?  
INTERFACE: Twostreams is a safe, nurturing environment.  
AMY: You know what I mean. Where can I go so the Handbots can't find me? Okay.
Before, I was stood by a sort of vent, and there was light and smoke, and the
Handbots couldn't see me. Why not? Okay, I will put it another way. What were
those vent thingies?  
INTERFACE: The vents channel the exhaust fumes from the Temporal Engines that
hold the multiple timestreams in place.  
AMY: And these Temporal Engines mess up the Handbots' sensors. So, where's the
Temporal Engines?  
INTERFACE: Temporal Engines held within.  
(Interface shows Amy an image of the entrance to the Temporal Engines, by the
Arrivals lounge.)  
AMY: Okay.  
(Two Handbots beam in.)  
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.  
(Amy grabs their sensing hands and pushes them together. They short out.)  
AMY: Ha! Don't like that, do you?  
(She finds the door and goes inside.)

**[Temporal Engine room]**

AMY: Temporal engines. Somewhere to hide.  
(She goes back to the door and writes on it with her lipstick - Doctor I'm
waiting - and puts an arrow to the door handle.)

**[Tardis]**

RORY [OC]: Where is everyone?  
DOCTOR: Right, Rory, switch the Time Glass on and sonic it.

**[Red Waterfall corridor]**

DOCTOR [OC]: I'm sending a command signal to the screwdriver. Amy's here
somewhere, if I can just get a lock on her.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: I wonder what happens if we mix the filters?  
(Lots of blurry people appear in the Time Glass, and via Rory-cam on a screen
in the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, there they are. Forty thousand time streams overlapping. Red
Waterfall isn't one time stream, it's thousands.

**[Red Waterfall corridor]**

RORY: Are they happy?  
DOCTOR: Oh, Rory.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Trust you to think of that.

**[Red Waterfall corridor]**

DOCTOR [OC]: I think they're happy to be alive. Better than the alternative.  
(Rory lowers the Time Glass and is confronted by a red haired female Samurai
warrior. He falls backwards.)  
RORY: I come in peace. Peace, peace, peace, peace.  
WARRIOR: I waited.  
RORY: Sorry, what?  
WARRIOR: I waited for you. I waited for you.  
(The warrior raises her helmet. She is an older Amy.)  
RORY: Amy.

**[Tardis]**

RORY [OC]: Doctor, what's going on?  
DOCTOR: Er

**[Red Waterfall corridor]**

RORY: Amy.  
DOCTOR [OC]: I think the timestream lock might be a bit wobbly.  
(Amy raises her sword.)  
RORY: No, please. Please.  
AMY: Duck.  
(Amy's katana goes straight through a Handbot's head.)  
AMY: Handbots carry a black box in case they go offline. I've changed the
cause of termination from hostile to accidental.

**[Tardis]**

AMY [on screen]: Easy to re-programme. Used my sonic probe.

**[Red Waterfall corridor]**

RORY: Amy.  
AMY: Rory.  
RORY: Why?  
AMY: Because I've survived this long by making the Handbots think I don't
exist.

**[Tardis]**

AMY [on screen]: Don't touch the hands.

**[Red Waterfall corridor]**

AMY: There's anaesthetic transfer on the skin. If they touch you, you go to
sleep.  
RORY: But you're still here?  
AMY: You didn't save me.  
RORY: But, this is the saving. This is the us saving you. The Doctor just got
the timing a bit out.  
DOCTOR [silent]: Sorry.  
AMY: I've been on my own here a long, long time. I've had decades to think
nice thoughts about him. Got a bit harder to stay charitable once I entered
decade four.  
RORY: Forty years? Alone?  
AMY: Thirty six years, thanks.  
RORY: No. Right. I mean, you look great. Really, really.  
AMY: Eyes front, soldier.  
RORY: Still can't win then.  
AMY: In fact, I think I can now definitely say I hate him. I hate The Doctor.
I hate him more than I've ever hated anyone

**[Tardis]**

AMY [on screen]: In my life, and you can hear every word of this through those
ridiculous glasses, can't you, Raggedy Man?  
DOCTOR: Er, yes. Putting the speaker phone on.  
AMY [on scanner]: You told me to wait, and I did. A lifetime.  
DOCTOR: Amy  
AMY [on scanner]: You've got nothing to say to me.  
DOCTOR: Amy, behind you.

**[Red Waterfall corridor]**

(Two more Handbots. Amy throws her katana to Rory and touches the Handbots
hands together.)  
AMY: Feedback. Knocks them out.

**[Tardis]**

AMY [on scanner]: Learned that trick on my first day.

**[Arrivals area]**

RORY: Okay, so we just take the Tardis back to the right time stream, yeah?

**[Tardis]**

RORY [OC]: We can stop any of this happening.

**[Arrivals area]**

DOCTOR [OC]: We locked on to a timestream, Rory. This is it.  
RORY: This is so wrong.  
AMY: I got old, Rory. What did you think was going to happen?  
RORY: Hey, I don't care that you got old. I care that we didn't grow old
together. Amy, come on, please.  
AMY: Don't touch me. Don't do that.  
RORY: It's like you're not even her.  
AMY: Thirty six years, three months, four days of solitary confinement. This
facility was built to give people the chance to live.

**[Tardis]**

AMY [on scanner]: I walked in here and I died. Do you have anything to say?
Anything, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Where did you get a sonic screwdriver?  
AMY [on scanner]: I made it. And it's a sonic probe.

**[Arrivals area]**

(The lipstick has all but disappeared from the door now.)  
RORY: You made a sonic screwdriver?  
AMY: Probe.

**[Amy's lair]**

(Rory follows Amy into the place she has made her home. There is a Handbot
with a smiling face drawn on its head and hooks instead of hands.)  
RORY: Oh.  
AMY: Don't worry about him. Sit down, Rory.  
(The Handbot sits, as does Rory.)  
RORY: You named him after me?  
AMY: Needed a bit of company.  
RORY: So he's like your pet? Is it safe?  
(Amy gets the remains of her lipstick from a box and looks at it.)  
AMY: Yep. I disarmed it.  
RORY: How? Oh, you disarmed it.  
AMY: Oh, don't get sentimental, it's just a robot. You'd have done the same.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: I don't know that I would have.  
AMY [on scanner]: And there he is. The voice of God. Survive, because no one's
going to come for you. Number one lesson.

**[Amy's lair]**

AMY: You taught me that.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Is that really all I taught you?

**[Tardis]**

AMY [on scanner]: Don't you lecture me, blue-box man flying through time and
space on whimsy. All I've got, all I've had for thirty six years, is cold,
hard reality.

**[Amy's lair]**

AMY: So no, I don't have a sonic screwdriver because I'm not off on a romp. I
call it what it is. A probe. And I call my life what it is. Hell.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Amy Pond, I am going to put this right. You said you learned from an

**[Amy's lair]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Interface. Can I speak with it?  
AMY: Doesn't work in here. Two twenty three. The garden'll be clear now. Stay
or go?  
RORY: Sorry, me? No, I'm coming with you.  
AMY: Then try not to get killed. Or do. Whatever.

**[Garden]**

AMY: When I first came here, I had to trick the Interface into giving me the
information, but I've reprogrammed it now. It'll tell me anything except how
to escape.  
RORY: You hacked it? That's genius.  
DOCTOR: Sorry to interrupt that beautiful moment, but temporal engines

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Like that have a regulator valve. Has to be kept at a distance from
the main reactor or there'd be feedback. Interface, where's the regulator?  
INTERFACE: The regulator valve is held within.  
(Showing a diagram of the location.)  
DOCTOR: Oh. Very, very ah.

**[Garden]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Interface, I need to run through some technical specifications.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Rory, give me to Amy a minute.

**[Garden]**

RORY: Here you go.  
(He hands over the glasses and she slowly puts them on.)  
AMY: They look ridiculous.  
RORY: That's what I told him. Still, anything beats a fez, eh?  
(They laugh briefly together.)  
RORY: What is it?  
AMY: I think that's the first time I've laughed in thirty six years.  
RORY: I'll just, er, leave you two geniuses alone. I'll be back in a minute.  
DOCTOR [OC]: There's still time, Amy. There's still time to fix everything.  
(Rory goes walking along the terrace until he comes to the portal.)  
RORY: How can you have a door without a wall?  
(A Handbot is approaching as he walks into the invisible wall by the portal.)  
RORY: Oh. Holographic wallpaper? Oh, sorry. Argh.  
(The Handbot touches his neck and he falls backwards.)  
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.  
(It is about to fire its needle gun at Rory when Amy chops its head off.)  
RORY: Oh.  
AMY: Rory?  
RORY: Glasses.  
AMY: You stupid  
RORY: Oh. You saved me.  
AMY: Don't get used to it.  
RORY: Have you been crying? A little bit.  
AMY: Shut up, Rory.  
RORY: You have, haven't you?  
AMY: Woman with a sword. Don't push it.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Okay. So, here's the plan.

**[Garden]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Time is always a bit wibbly-wobbly, but in Twostreams it's extra
wobbly.  
(Amy puts the glasses back on Rory.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: I've worked out how to hijack the Temporal Engines and use them to
fold two points of Amy's timeline together. We're bringing her out of the then
and into the now. Amy, I just need to borrow your brain a minute. It won't
hurt, probably. Almost probably and then

**[Garden]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Amy Pond, I'm going to save you.

**[Tardis]**

AMY [on screen]: No.

**[Garden]**

AMY: Time's up. Handbots coming.

**[Arrivals area]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Amy, you've got to help us help you. I need you to think back

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Thirty six years ago. Amy? Amy!

**[Arrivals area]**

(Amy goes back to the Temporal Engines entrance and shuts the door in Rory's
face. Rory uses the Time Glass to read the faded message.)  
RORY: You told her to leave us a sign.

**[Tardis]**

RORY [OC]: And she did. And she waited.

**[Temporal Engine room]**

RORY: Oh Amy, why won't you help yourself?  
AMY: He wants to rescue past me from thirty six years back, which means I'll
cease to exist. Everything I've seen and done dissolves. Time is rewritten.  
RORY: That's, that's good, isn't it?  
AMY: I will die. Another Amy will take my place. An Amy who never got trapped
at Twostreams, an Amy who grew old with you, and she, in thirty six years,
won't be me.  
RORY: But you'll die in here!  
AMY: Not if you take me with you.

**[Tardis]**

AMY [on screen]: You came to rescue me, so rescue me.

**[Temporal Engine room]**

RORY: Leave her and take you?

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: We could take this Amy with us, easy, but if we do, our Amy has to
wait thirty six years to be rescued.

**[Temporal Engine room]**

RORY: So I have to choose. Which wife do I want?  
AMY: She is me. We're both me.  
RORY: You being here is wrong. For a single day, an hour, let alone a
lifetime. I swore to protect you. I promised.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Rory

**[Temporal Engine room]**

RORY: This is your fault.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: I'm so sorry, but, Rory

**[Temporal Engine room]**

RORY: No, this is your fault! You should look in a history book once in a
while, see if there's an outbreak of

**[Tardis]**

RORY [OC]: Plague or not.  
DOCTOR: That is not how I travel.

**[Temporal Engine room]**

RORY: Then I do not want to travel with you!  
(Rory takes off the glasses and throws them away. In the Tardis, the Doctor
can hear younger Amy crying.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Rory, is the Time Glass still on? If the link's still active, I
think I can hear Amy. Our Amy.  
(It is. Rory looks through it to see her standing nearby.)  
RORY: Oh, Amy.

**[Amy's lair]**

RORY: Look me in the face and say you won't help her.  
AMY: I will not help her.  
RORY: Okay, okay. Look me in the face and say it now.  
(He holds up the Time Glass so that Amy can see her weeping younger self.)  
AMY [in glass]: Rory? Rory is that you?  
(Rory sonicks the Time Glass so that it appears in the past.)

**[Past Temporal Engine room]**

AMY: Rory, where are you?  
RORY [OC]: Same place as you, and a bit ahead.

**[Amy's lair]**

OLDER AMY: I remember this.  
AMY [in glass]: But who's she? There's no one else here but. Me?  
(Rory the Handbot holds the glasses out to Rory with his hook.)

**[Past Temporal Engine room]**

AMY: Why are we still here?

**[Amy's lair]**

OLDER AMY: Because they leave you. Because they get in their Tardis and they
fly away.

**[Past Temporal Engine room]**

AMY: No. Rory wouldn't, not ever. Something must have stopped him.

**[Amy's lair]**

OLDER AMY: You did. Or rather, the old version of you.

**[Past Temporal Engine room]**

OLDER AMY [in glass]: The me version of you. I refuse to help them. I won't
let them save myself.  
AMY: Why?

**[Amy's lair]**

OLDER AMY: If you escape, then I was never trapped here. The last thirty six
years of my life rewrites, and I cease to exist. That's why old me refused to
help then. That's why I'm refusing to help now. And that's why you'll refuse
to help when it's your turn. And nothing you can say will change that.

**[Past Temporal Engine room]**

AMY: Three words. What about Rory?  
OLDER AMY [in glass]: Rory?

**[Amy's lair]**

OLDER AMY: I called my robot Rory.  
AMY [in glass]: You called your robot Rory?

**[Past Temporal Engine room]**

AMY: Oh, so you didn't call it the Doctor, or Biggles

**[Amy's lair]**

AMY [in glass]: Our favourite cat?  
OLDER AMY: Do you, er, do you

**[Past Temporal Engine room]**

OLDER AMY [in glass]: Remember that summer when he came back to school with
that ridiculous haircut?  
AMY: He said he'd been in a rock band.

**[Amy's lair]**

OLDER AMY: Liar. And, and then he had to learn to play the guitar.

**[Past Temporal Engine room]**

AMY: So we wouldn't know he couldn't play it. Mmm hmm.

**[Amy's lair]**

OLDER AMY: All those boys chasing me, but it was only ever Rory. Why was that?

**[Past Temporal Engine room]**

AMY: You know when sometimes you meet someone so beautiful

**[Amy's lair]**

AMY [in glass]: And then you actually talk to them, and five minutes later
they're as dull as a brick?

**[Past Temporal Engine room]**

AMY: Then there's other people, and you meet them and think, not bad, they're
okay. And then you get to know them, and their face just sort of becomes them,
like their personality's written all over it. And they just turn into
something so beautiful.  
BOTH: Rory's the most beautiful man I've ever met.  
AMY: Please? Do it for him.

**[Amy's lair]**

OLDER AMY: You're asking me to defy destiny, causality, the nexus of time
itself, for a boy.

**[Past Temporal Engine room]**

AMY: You're Amy, he's Rory, and oh yes, I am.

**[Temporal Engine room]**

(Rory has been waiting outside all this time.)  
OLDER AMY: I am going to pull time apart for you.  
(She kisses Rory. Rory the Handbot discreetly turns its back.)

**[Tardis]**

OLDER AMY [in glass]: Okay, Doctor, Twostreams is back on air. Right, okay, so
this is big news.

**[Temporal Engine room]**

OLDER AMY: This is temporal earthquake time. I am now officially changing my
own future. Hold on to your spectacles. In my past, I saw my future self
refuse to help you. I'm now changing that future and

**[Tardis]**

OLDER AMY [in glass]: Agreeing. Every law of time says that shouldn't be
possible.  
DOCTOR: Yes, except sometimes knowing your own future's what enables you to
change it. Especially if you're bloody minded, contradictory

**[Arrivals area]**

DOCTOR [OC]: And completely unpredictable.  
RORY: So basically, if you're Amy, then?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, if anyone could defeat pre-destiny,

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: It's your wife.

**[Arrivals area]**

OLDER AMY: It's not about what I'm doing, but who I'm doing it for. I'm
trusting you to watch my back, Rory.  
RORY: Always. You and me, always.  
OLDER AMY: Because here's the deal. You take me, too. In the Tardis. Me too.  
RORY: But that means that there'll be two of you.

**[Tardis]**

RORY [on screen]: Permanently. Forever.  
OLDER AMY [on screen]: And that way we both get to live.

**[Arrivals area]**

RORY: Two Amys together. Can that work?  
DOCTOR [OC]: I don't know.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: It's your marriage.

**[Arrivals area]**

RORY: Doctor.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Perhaps. Maybe, if I shunted the reality compensators on the Tardis,
re-calibrated the Doomsday bumpers and jettisoned the karaoke bar, yes. Maybe.
Yes. It could do it. The Tardis could sustain the paradox.

**[Arrivals area]**

RORY: Right. Amy and Amy.  
(Young Amy is there, seen through the Time Glass.)  
RORY: The wife and the wife. Right. Right.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Okay. Amy, Past Amy, stand by the door. Future Amy, you too.

**[Arrivals area]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Future Amy, can I borrow your sonic scr

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Probe.

**[Arrivals area]**

OLDER AMY: It's a screwdriver.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Rory, sonic it. Double our power. Amy Now, you're our link to Amy
Then.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: We need to get a signal through, and that signal

**[Arrivals area]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Will be a thought.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Amy Now and Amy Then, share a thought. Something so

**[Arrivals area]**

DOCTOR: Powerful that it can rip through time. Rory

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Sonic the plinth front. Inside you'll find

**[Arrivals area]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Three levers and a jumble of wiring.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: That's the regulator valve. After we re-route it, you have ten minutes
to get back to the Tardis.

**[Arrivals area]**

RORY: Okay.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Pull out the red and green receptors. Re-route the blue into the red
and

**[Arrivals area]**

DOCTOR [OC]: The green into blue. Leave the red loose and on no account

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Touch anything yellow. Come on, Rory. It's hardly rocket science. It's
just

**[Arrivals area]**

DOCTOR: Quantum physics.  
RORY: Yes, right. Blue into red and then green  
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, the levers.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Throw them in order.

**[Arrivals area]**

DOCTOR [OC]: And Amys, start thinking the most important thought you have ever
had.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Hold it in your head and do not let it go. Lever one.

**[Arrivals area]**

BOTH AMYS: Macarena. Macarena.  
RORY: She's doing the Macarena.  
BOTH AMYS: Macarena. Macarena.  
RORY: Our first kiss.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Lever two, Rory. Lever three.  
(The Time Glass and the screen blow out. The past Arrivals area is empty.)

**[Arrivals area]**

(Both Amys are together.)  
RORY: Oh, Amy.  
AMY: Oh, my God.  
OLDER AMY: Oh, my God.  
(Rory hugs young Amy. Older Amy looks a bit embarrassed.)  
RORY: Sorry.  
OLDER AMY: Hello.  
AMY: Hello.  
BOTH: I don't know what to  
RORY: Weird.  
BOTH: Okay, this is weird. Right, just stop doing that.  
RORY: How about Amy One speaks first?  
BOTH: Which one's Amy One?  
RORY: Well  
BOTH: I am. No, I am. Rory? Rory, just stop doing that.  
(The Rory-cam glasses start to spark.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Rory. Rory, take the glasses off. You're getting temporal feedback.  
(Bits of the console go bang.)  
DOCTOR: Whoa! Calm down, dear. Rory, Amy, we've created a massive paradox and
the Tardis hates it. She's self-phasing, trying to get out of here. What's the
nasty Amy done to you. Just calm down, dear. Hang on in there. Rory, you've
got eight minutes left. I'm sorry, you're on your own now.  
(The glasses explode.)

**[Arrivals area]**

RORY: I'm not on my own. I've got my wives.  
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed.  
RORY: Incoming!  
HANDBOT: Rhis is a kindness.  
OLDER AMY: With me.  
(Older Amy gives her younger self a stout staff.)  
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed, this is a kindness. This is a kindness.  
OLDER AMY: Amy, Kate Hayler, year ten hockey.  
AMY: Go for the shins.  
HANDBOT: This is a kindness.  
(With those disposed of, more Handbots beam in.)  
RORY: They're cutting off the Departure Gate. We can't get back to the Tardis.  
OLDER AMY: Side door. We'll go behind them.

**[Staircase]**

AMY: So you think you're going to come with us, just like that.  
OLDER AMY: Yeah, just like that.  
AMY: Rory, talk to her.  
OLDER AMY: Rory, talk to her.  
RORY: Now, ladies

**[Basement]**

AMY: Where are you going to live?  
OLDER AMY: Not with you, don't worry. I'll go travelling. Pop back for
Christmas, maybe Easter.  
RORY: Amy, you always say, cooking Christmas dinner, you wish there was two of
you.

**[Gate Room]**

RORY: Can't we just teleport in?  
OLDER AMY: It's not a teleport, it's a time jump.  
AMY: They can't shunt within the same timestream.  
OLDER AMY: Yes.  
RORY: The Tardis is in the Gallery.  
INTERFACE: Gallery closed.  
OLDER AMY: The controls are stuck. They've locked them from outside.  
RORY: Can you unlock them?  
OLDER AMY: Yeah, give me a minute and your cutest smile. That's the one.  
RORY: Can you stop flirting with me. You're old enough to be my  
OLDER AMY: I've known you my whole life. How many games of Doctors And Nurses?
Shush. Don't get coy now.  
AMY: Er  
(Handbots enter via the portals. Rory tries to sonic the control column.)  
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a
kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.  
(Older Amy starts swinging her katana.)  
OLDER AMY: No!  
RORY: Come on.  
OLDER AMY: Go! I've got your back.

**[Gallery]**

(There are Handbots waiting there.)  
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.  
(Amy gets touched.)  
RORY: No!  
(He smashes the Mona Lisa over the Handbot's head, and picks Amy up as Older
Amy finally comes through the portal. She stares as he runs with his Amy into
the Tardis without looking back.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Ah, it's just an anaesthetic. She'll be fine.  
(The Doctor goes to the door. Older Amy starts running towards the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.  
(And slams the door in her face.)  
RORY: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: I lied to her, Rory. There can never be two Amys in the Tardis. The
paradox is too massive.  
RORY: You can't leave her. She'll die.

**[Gallery]**

OLDER AMY: Doctor, let me in.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: No, she'll never have existed. When we save our Amy, this future won't
have happened.  
RORY: But she happened. She's there.  
OLDER AMY [OC]: I trusted you!  
DOCTOR: No, she's not real.  
RORY: She is real. Let her in.  
DOCTOR: Look, we take this Amy, we leave ours. Only one Amy in the Tardis.
Which one do you want?  
(The Doctor puts Rory's hand on the door latch.)  
DOCTOR: It's your choice.  
RORY: This isn't fair. You're turning me into you.  
DOCTOR: Your choice, Rory.  
RORY: I, er  
OLDER AMY [OC]: Doctor? Doctor! Doctor? Doctor?

**[Gallery]**

OLDER AMY: Rory, please.  
(She puts her hand against a glass pane in the door. Rory does the same.)  
OLDER AMY: The look on your face when you carried her. Me. Her.

**[Tardis]**

OLDER AMY [OC]: When you carried her away. You used to look at me like that.

**[Gallery]**

OLDER AMY: I'd forgotten how much you loved me. I'd forgotten how much I loved
being her. Amy Pond, in the Tardis, with Rory Williams.

**[Tardis]**

RORY: I'm sorry, I can't do this.  
(He unlatches the door.)

**[Gallery]**

OLDER AMY: If you love me, don't let me in. Open that door, I will, I'll come
in. I don't want to die. I won't bow out bravely.

**[Tardis]**

OLDER AMY [OC]: I'll be kicking and screaming, fighting.

**[Gallery]**

OLDER AMY: To the end.

**[Tardis]**

RORY: Amy. Amy, I love you.

**[Gallery/Tardis]**

(Split screen.)  
OLDER AMY: I love you, too. Don't let me in. Tell Amy, your Amy, I'm giving
her the days. The days with you. The days to come.  
RORY: I'm so, so sorry.  
OLDER AMY: The days I can't have. Take them, please.

**[Tardis]**

OLDER AMY [OC]: I'm giving you my days.  
RORY: I'm so, so sorry.

**[Gallery]**

(Five more Handbots.)  
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.

**[Tardis]**

HANDBOT [OC]: Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.

**[Gallery]**

OLDER AMY: Interface?  
INTERFACE: I am here, Amy Pond.  
OLDER AMY: Show me Earth. Show me home. Did I ever tell you about this boy I
met there, who pretended to be in a band?  
(A Handbot touches Older Amy, and she collapses. The Tardis dematerialises.)

**[Tardis]**

RORY: Did you always know it would never work? Saving both Amys?  
DOCTOR: I promised you I'd save her, and there she is. Safe.  
RORY: Yeah, there she is.  
(Amy is waking up. The Doctor sticks his tongue out at her.)  
DOCTOR: I'll leave you two alone.  
RORY: You all right?  
AMY: Mmm hmm.  
RORY: How are you feeling?  
AMY: Where is she?
