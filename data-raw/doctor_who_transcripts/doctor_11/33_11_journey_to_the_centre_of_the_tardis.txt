**Journey to the Centre of the Tardis**  
  
Original Airdate: 27 Apr, 2013  

**[Salvage ship]**

(Van Baalan Bros salvage ship A89//0989 is powering its way through space.
Clue - a photograph of three men has one side torn off. Two men are asleep in
their bunks whilst a third - not in the photograph - is cleaning parts. He has
a barcode on his neck and bionic eyes. The computer beeps.)  
COMPUTER: Incoming salvage. Please validate. Incoming salvage. Please
validate. Incoming salvage. Please validate.  
(The taller of the two men gets up.)  
BRAM: Rusty garbage. It's not worth lacing up my boots.  
TRICKY: Wasting our time. There's no salvage this far out.  
BRAM: You're a lucky boy, Tricky. You're an android. You don't get bored.  
(They look across at another man still in his bunk.)  
TRICKY: He won't turn back. Not with half a cargo.  
BRAM: He's not captain. We're equal partners.  
TRICKY: Yeah. Right.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: You said  
CLARA: I know what I said. I was the one who said it.  
DOCTOR: You said it was looking at you funny.  
CLARA: I was tired, overwrought. I didn't mean it. It's an appliance. It does
a job.  
DOCTOR: It's a pretty cool appliance. We're not talking cheese grater here.  
CLARA: You're not getting me to talk to your ship. That's properly bonkers.  
DOCTOR: (to console) It's okay, it's okay.  
CLARA: You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girl unless his
mother approves.  
DOCTOR: It's important to me you get along. I could leave you two alone
together.  
CLARA: Now you're creeping me out.  
DOCTOR: Take the wheel. Not the wheel. I'll make it easy. Shut it down to
basic mode for you.  
CLARA: Basic? Because I'm a girl?  
DOCTOR: No.  
(And turns a key labelled 'Smiths'.

**[Salvage ship]**

GREGOR: Everyone suit up. It's good salvage. I can smell it.  
(Their radar has picked up the Tardis.)  
BRAM: It's just trash.  
TRICKY: No, look. There's something tasty in the magno-field.  
COMPUTER: Magno-grab ready. Engaging.  
(The cargo doors open wide like jaws.)  
GREGOR: Move yourself.  
(They get dressed - heavy boots, overalls, and a small grenade-like device. A
blue energy beam shoots out and grabs the Tardis whilst loud music plays.)

**[Tardis]**

(And the power goes out just as Clara operates a control.)  
CLARA: What have I done?  
DOCTOR: Er, okay.  
CLARA: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: All the electrical impulses are jammed. I can't get the shields back
up. She's completely vulnerable.  
CLARA: I swear I just touched it.  
(The Doctor manages to push up a breaker lever and there is a big bang.)  
DOCTOR: Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stay by me.  
CLARA: Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Big friendly button.  
CLARA: You're lying.  
DOCTOR: Yep.  
CLARA: To stop me freaking out?  
DOCTOR: Is it working?  
CLARA: Not so much.  
(The grenade device rolls along the floor. Clara picks it up and it burns her
hand. She drops it again. Bang!)

**[Salvage ship]**

(Huge sets of pincers pass the Tardis along inside the ship.)  
TRICKY: What is it, some kind of escape pod?  
GREGOR: Come on.  
(The Tardis has been dumped onto a pile of cables and is lying at 45 degrees.)  
GREGOR: Crack it open.  
(Gregor runs forward with a large hammer. That has no effect. Next comes the
focused laser cutter.)  
BRAM: It's doing nothing.  
GREGOR: Use the thermo-charge and blast it.  
TRICKY: No, no, no, wait. It's like she's alive. She's, she's suffering. I can
feel it. I can feel it.  
That's just robot rant.  
BRAM: No, Gregor, he's right. Looks like there's a broken fuel line.  
(Steam is coming out of the top of the Tardis.)  
GREGOR: All right. All right, put it back. No salvage today, boys. Open the
bay doors.  
TRICKY: Wait.  
(Tricky's bionic eye zooms in on a boot sticking out of the cables under the
Tardis.)  
TRICKY: Somebody's under that thing. The crew were still on board when we
dragged her in.  
GREGOR: We did nothing. If anyone asks, that ship was already busted. You got
that? And you, make sure you keep your oily mouth shut, right?  
DOCTOR: It's rude to whisper. Hi. I'm the Doctor. And you are? Er, Van Baalen
and Van Baalen. Van Baalen and Van Baalen. That's going to get confusing
later.  
GREGOR: We found you drifting.  
BRAM: Yeah, your ship was junked up pretty bad.  
DOCTOR: What broke my ship was a magno-grab. Found this remote in your pocket.
Eh? What are the chances? Outlawed in most galaxies, this little beastie can
disable whole vessels unless you have shield oscillators, which I turned off
so that Clara could fly, damn it. Clara. Where is she? Girl, about so high.
Feisty. She's still on board.  
TRICKY: No, wait. Your pod is leaking fuel. If she's still in here, she's
dead.  
DOCTOR: Ah, respirators.  
GREGOR: We can open the doors for a split second, reach in and grab her.  
DOCTOR: Trust me, we can't. Now please, help me get her out.  
TRICKY: I'm telling you, she fried  
GREGOR: Shut it, tin mouth. What sort of fee are we talking?  
DOCTOR: If you help me get her out, you get the machine, all the scrap, eh?  
BRAM: It's not worth the risk. Four feet of metal? Nah.  
DOCTOR: What if I can guarantee you the best haul you've ever had?  
GREGOR: Bram, open the bay doors.  
DOCTOR: No, no. Please, stop. Listen, listen. Right behind those doors is the
salvage of a lifetime.

**[Corridor]**

(Inside the Tardis, the Cloister bell is tolling. Clara wakes up under an
ornate but light piece of rubble.)  
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor?  
(She blows on her burnt palm and walks along to a bulkhead door.)  
CLARA: Red flashing light means something bad. Get out of here fast? Or
possibly, whatever you do, don't open this door.  
(So she opens the door. There is an explosion.)  
CLARA: Bad decision.  
(She runs from the fireball and closes the next bulkhead door she finds. There
are deep claw marks in the wall nearby, and something growls.)

**[Salvage ship]**

BRAM: Hey, are we really going to risk it? That thing is spewing poison. We
should blow it back into space.  
GREGOR: Get your gear.  
BRAM: Hey, I don't take orders from my kid brother.  
GREGOR: Don't try and form sentences, all right? Stick to what you do best.  
DOCTOR: Tell me, since when does an android need a blast suit and a
respirator?  
BRAM: Flesh coating, same as us. He'd burn up.  
TRICKY: No fear, no hate, no pain.  
(The Doctor unlocks the Tardis.)  
GREGOR: Salvage of a lifetime?  
DOCTOR: I feel pretty confident I can deliver on that. Here we go.

**[Tardis]**

GREGOR: I don't get it. I thought she was lying on her side.  
DOCTOR: The Tardis is special. She has her own gravity. I'd explain if I had
some charts and a board pen.  
GREGOR: It's, it's, it's bigger  
DOCTOR: On the inside. Do you know, I get that a lot.  
TRICKY: Whoa. Awesome.  
DOCTOR: Well put. Whoa and awesome.  
(The Doctor vents the fumes from the console room.)  
DOCTOR: Safe to breathe.  
(They all remove the respirators. The Doctor scans with the sonic
screwdriver.)  
DOCTOR: Okay, now, the last thing I remember, you were right there. Come on,
Clara, talk to me.  
BRAM: How big is this baby?  
DOCTOR: Picture the biggest ship you've ever seen. Are you picturing it?  
BRAM: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: Good. Now forget it, because this ship is infinite.  
GREGOR: It could take you hours to find the girl.  
DOCTOR: Days. Plus this whole place is toxic. She could be dead by the time I
reach her. So, here's the mission. We're going to find her in one hour.  
GREGOR: We?  
DOCTOR: You're my guys for this.  
GREGOR: That wasn't the deal.  
DOCTOR: 'Tis now.  
BRAM: What makes you think we'll help?  
(A countdown clock starts on the scanner.)  
DOCTOR: I just activated the Tardis self-destruct system. One hour until this
ship blows.  
(Bram runs for the door, which slams in his face.)  
DOCTOR: Don't try to leave. The Tardis is in lockdown. I'll open those doors
when Clara's by my side.  
BRAM: You crazy lunatic!  
DOCTOR: My ship, my rules.  
GREGOR: You'll kill us all. And the girl.  
DOCTOR: She's going to die if you don't help me. Don't get into a spaceship
with a madman. Didn't anyone ever teach you that? Okay, a little gently
persuasion. Say thirty minutes.  
(The countdown jumps to 29:59:10.)  
BRAM: She'll die even quicker now!  
DOCTOR: We all perform better under pressure. Anybody want to go for fifteen
minutes?  
BRAM: Whoa!  
GREGOR: Whoa!  
DOCTOR: It's your own time you're wasting. Salvage of a lifetime. You meant
the ship. I meant Clara.

**[Storeroom]**

(Clara finds an old-fashioned room with a stone arched door, and the Doctor's
cradle. She takes down a model of the Tardis from a shelf. Someone or
something else is there with her. Clara spots it as she picks up a black
umbrella.)  
CLARA: Oh!  
(And runs out.)

**[Corridor]**

(Gregor hangs back from the Doctor, Tricky and Bram.)  
GREGOR: Report. What's on board this thing?  
COMPUTER: Dynomorphic generators, conceptual geometer, beam synthesiser,
orthogonal engine filters.  
(He catches the others up.)  
GREGOR: Guys, guys, look, I think we should split up. It's our best chance of
finding the girl. You know it is.  
DOCTOR: Don't touch a thing. The Tardis will get huffy if you mess.  
GREGOR: Keep in radio contact, all right?  
(Tricky nods and goes off with the Doctor.)  
GREGOR: Get back to the console. Strip it apart.  
BRAM: Okay.  
GREGOR: All right?  
(They split up. Meanwhile, Clara is running from the growling biped, past an
observatory with lovely big Victorian telescope and an open air swimming pool
into -)

**[Library]**

(Letters are starting to appear on her burnt palm. This library has both
shelves of books and shelves of bottles. Six stories of them.  
CLARA: Now that's just showing off.

**[Tardis]**

(Bram prises off a section of the console.)  
SUSAN [OC]: I made up the name Tardis from the initials Time And Relative
Dimension In Space.  
DOCTOR 3 [OC]: The Tardis is dimensionally transcendental.  
JO: [OC]: What does that mean?  
DOCTOR 4 [OC]: That's trans-dimensional engineering. A key Time Lord
discovery.  
DOCTOR 9 [OC]: The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that
door. Believe me, they've tried.  
AMY [OC]: We are in space!  
IAN [OC]: It can move anywhere in time and space?  
(And other indistinct phrases.)

**[Corridor]**

(Gregor is following the beeps on his scanner.)  
COMPUTER: Everything.  
GREGOR: What? Report.  
COMPUTER: Everything, behind that door.  
GREGOR: Everything?  
COMPUTER: Sensor detects everything you could possibly want.

**[ARS room]**

(Of course, he goes in. There are lots of cables dangling down, with large
glowing bulbs on the end.)  
COMPUTER: Everything.  
GREGOR: I don't understand. Give me a price tag.  
COMPUTER: Incalculable.  
GREGOR: What?  
COMPUTER: More valuable than the total sum of any currency. Living metal.
Bespoke engineering. Whatever machine you require, this system will build it.  
(Gregor raises the focused laser cutter to take some. The Doctor and Tricky
run in.)  
DOCTOR: No! No, no, stop! Please, don't. Don't touch it. Please. She won't let
you touch it. I can feel a Tardis tantrum coming on.  
GREGOR: What the hell is this place?  
DOCTOR: Architectural Reconfiguration System. It reconstructs particles
according to your needs.  
GREGOR: A machine that makes machines?  
DOCTOR: Yes, basically. What are you doing? No, no, don't. Don't!  
(Gregor takes hold of one of the Gallifreyan engraved light bulbs.)  
DOCTOR: If you walk out of here with that circuit, the Tardis will try to stop
you. Now listen to me. Look, the clock is ticking. We must find Clara.  
(Gregor pulls off the light bulb and the whole ship roars.)  
GREGOR: What the? Where's the door gone?  
DOCTOR: Ever seen a spaceship get ugly?  
GREGOR: This isn't happening.  
DOCTOR: She won't relinquish it. Her basic genetic material.  
GREGOR: Torch it. I said, torch it.  
TRICKY: Can't you feel it, Gregor? The ship, the ship's in torment, like it's
a living thing. You can't hurt it.  
(Gregor puts the light bulb in his backpack, and the door returns.)  
GREGOR: What's the matter, Tardis? Scared to fight me?

**[Library]**

(Clara finds a large bound book on its own special stand - The History of the
Time War. She opens it in the middle and does a little reading.)  
CLARA: So that's who  
(Clang, growl. She dodges behind another rack of books and bottle to hide from
the thing. Above her are bottles containing the Encyclopedia Gallifreyica. We
can hear muffled voices. Clara presses back against the rack, one of the
bottles tips over, and the words tumble out over her head. She wafts them away
so the creature cannot hear. It gets close and she runs for the entrance.)

**[Junction]**

TRICKY: It's the same. It's just the same.  
DOCTOR: It's diverting us, spinning a maze around us. We will never reach
Clara in time.  
(Gregor walks away, and they follow.)  
DOCTOR: Hey! Hey!  
(And return from the opposite direction.)  
TRICKY: It's just the same, again.  
DOCTOR: No point in building walls. You'll just know how to smash them down.
It's found other ways of controlling you. Smart bunch, Time Lords. No dress
sense, dreadful hats, but smart. If you want to get out of here, let that
circuit go. It is creating a labyrinth.  
GREGOR: Bram? Bram, can you hear me?

**[Under the console room]**

GREGOR [OC]: Bram, the ship is alive. Get out of there. Bram, don't touch
anything.  
BRAM: You're just the sweetest thing ever.

**[Console room]**

CLARA: Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
(She kisses the console.)  
CLARA: No! The door. Where's the door gone? No. You can't do this.

**[Under the console room]**

(Bram is following glowing power cables further and further down.)  
GREGOR [OC]: Bram? You've got to get out of there fast.  
(The cables touch Bram, and he falls. Once he has got up and dusted himself
off, something attacks him. Screams and twitches, then he is still.)

**[Junction]**

GREGOR: Channel's dead.  
TRICKY: We've got to help him. Gregor, do something. Do something!  
GREGOR: It's too late, he's gone. Let's just worry about the salvage.  
TRICKY: You care more about that circuit than you do about him.  
DOCTOR: Your concern for your brother is really touching. The android is more
cut up about it that you. Now will you two stop bickering and listen. There is
something else down there.  
TRICKY: We've got to get out of here. Gregor, give it back. Give it back to
her.  
(Tricky takes the light bulb from Gregor's pack.)  
GREGOR: What are you doing? You're always on the side of the machines.  
DOCTOR: Fellas! Multiple lifeforms on board the Tardis with us. I am getting a
massive signal.  
TRICKY: Where are they?  
DOCTOR: Oh, you're not going to like the answer. About two steps away. One
step.  
(Behind them. A strange conjoined twins creature attacks.)  
DOCTOR: Gregor, look out! Careful! Gregor, no! We have to stay together. Come
on, run. Tricky, run. I'm sorry.

**[Console room]**

(Clara discovers there is more than one console room, each at the end of a
corridor.)  
CLARA: Oh, why are you doing this?

**[Console room 2]**

TRICKY: Back where we started.  
DOCTOR: No, it's an echo. The console room is the safest place on the ship. It
can replicate itself any number of times. It's trying to protect us.  
TRICKY: Because I tried to give back the circuit?  
DOCTOR: Team Tardis.  
(The Doctor rummages in the wreck of the console. A piece of metal falls, and
lands in Clara's console room.)  
TRICKY: Where did, where did that go?  
DOCTOR: There's more than one echo room. Hey, look, look. The Tardis has got
Clara safe. That was her. That was her there. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
TRICKY: Why can't we see her?  
DOCTOR: It's like a light switch. Two positions, flickering at super-infinite
speeds. We're only together for a brief second. Shush.  
(They can hear Clara panting.)  
DOCTOR: I can hear her.  
(Clara opens an internal door. The creature is behind it. She screams. The
Doctor and Tricky can hear the growling.)  
TRICKY: She's let it in. She's let it in!  
DOCTOR: If I can just isolate her position, I can nudge the alternation, reach
in and grab her.

**[Console room]**

(Dodging around the console.)  
CLARA: Who are you?

**[Console room 2]**

COMPUTER: Console room, echo imprint of the original.  
GREGOR: You're coming with me. I need you to get me out of here.  
(The Doctor sonicks Gregor's hand computer.)  
COMPUTER: Scanning for female human. Scanning for female human. Unidentified
human.  
DOCTOR: It doesn't know Lancashire.  
GREGOR: What?  
DOCTOR: It doesn't know sass. Yes! It's found Clara. It's found her. She is
right there.  
(Clara screams, and partially appears. The Doctor grabs her and drags her
through.)  
DOCTOR: It's all right. Clara, I'm so, so sorry. Sorry. Please, please forgive
me, Clara.  
(Clara hits him.)  
DOCTOR: Ow! Okay, so we're not doing hugging. I get that now.  
CLARA: What do you keep in here? Why have you got zombie creatures? Good guys
do not have zombie creatures. Rule one basic storytelling.  
DOCTOR: Not in front of the guests.  
CLARA: Who are they?  
DOCTOR: Friends. Well, people who aren't trying to kill us, so I don't need
punching again.  
GREGOR: All right, all right. Look, a deal's a deal. You got the girl back.
Now cancel the self-destruct.  
DOCTOR: Ah. Ah. You know, I've got to tell you, I won't be needing you in my
quiz team.  
GREGOR: What?  
DOCTOR: There is no self-destruct. Hey? Hey? Hey? Had you going though, boys,
didn't I? I just wiggled a few buttons. Yeah, the old wiggly button trick. And
the face. You've got to do the face. Save her or we all die. I though I rushed
it a bit, but  
TRICKY: So you're telling us we're safe?  
DOCTOR: Ish. Apart from the monsters and the Tardis reinventing the
architecture every five minutes. Guys, don't worry. The countdown's a fake.
Look, just give me a second. I'll turn it off. I only made it look as though
the engine was actually exploding.  
(Eye of Harmony. Engine status: Overload.)  
DOCTOR: Ah. That's not good. Okay, don't panic. Or maybe panic.  
CLARA: Something you want to share with the rest of us?  
DOCTOR: It appears the engine is damaged. We're in trouble, Clara. Proper
trouble. It needs fixing or we're toast.  
CLARA: So now would be a good time to use that big friendly button, right?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Sorry, I should have had one built in.  
TRICKY: Where are we going?  
DOCTOR: Detour.  
(They run down the stairs and the Doctor sonicks open a hexagonal panel.)  
DOCTOR: The centre of the Tardis.

**[Corridor]**

(The Doctor is scanning as he leads the troop. Something flashes across the
corridor.)  
CLARA: Shush. Something's in here.  
TRICKY: Those things, they've followed us.  
CLARA: Doctor, what are they? What aren't you telling me?  
DOCTOR: Trust me. Some things you don't want to know.  
(Something crosses behind them.)  
GREGOR: They're on the move again.  
DOCTOR: Run. Move, move.  
(Clara gets separated from the men.)  
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor? Again.  
(The burn on her hand is becoming clearer - mirror writing.)  
CLARA 2: I know what I said. I was the one who said it.  
DOCTOR [OC]: You said it was looking at you funny.  
CLARA 2: Now you're creeping me out. Please tell me there is a button you can
press to fix this?  
(Present time Clara goes round the corner and sees the Doctor.)  
CLARA: Oh, thank god. Doctor, what's going on? Say something.  
(The now Doctor comes up behind her.)  
DOCTOR: Clara, stop. Don't touch it. There's a rupture in time somewhere on
board the ship. A small tear in the fabric of the continuum. It must have
happened when the Tardis was pulled in by the salvage vessel. The Tardis is
leaking.  
CLARA: Leaking what?  
(He leads her along the corridors.)  
DOCTOR: The past. You and me. Everything we've done, everything we've said.
Recent history. It's not real. It's a memory.  
(They come across the single bodied glowing red eyed creature.)  
CLARA: What about this?  
DOCTOR: If you're giving me the option, I'd say this one's real.  
(They run away. It chases them.)  
DOCTOR: She's right on to us.  
CLARA: She?  
DOCTOR: Clara, don't ask me any more.  
CLARA 2: You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girl unless his
mother approves.  
DOCTOR [OC]: It's important to me you get along.  
(The creature follows the echo people. There is a banging sound.)  
CLARA: What's that noise?  
DOCTOR: We're right under the primary fuel cells.  
CLARA: So? So, so what?  
DOCTOR: So, so the fuel's spilled out, so the rods will be exposed. Means
they'll cool  
CLARA: And start to warp.  
DOCTOR: And start to warp. Maybe even  
CLARA: No, you don't say it. Don't you dare say it.  
DOCTOR: Maybe even break apart.  
(A rod flies through the walls just in front of them.)  
CLARA: Run?  
DOCTOR: I'm liking how you're thinking.  
CLARA: Yeah.  
(They run as more rods pierce the corridors from different angles. Up ahead,
someone screams. Tricky has been speared by a rod through his shoulder.)  
TRICKY: Cut it off. Just cut my arm off.  
GREGOR: No.  
TRICKY: It's the quickest way to release me. No fear, no hate, no pain. I can
get a new one. Disposable parts. Just do it. It won't hurt me.  
GREGOR: Tricky, you just don't understand.  
TRICKY: I'm an android. Cut me!  
CLARA: You made it through.  
TRICKY: What's the matter with you? Why won't you cut me?  
DOCTOR: Tell him.  
TRICKY: Tell me what?  
DOCTOR: You can't, can you. You're a coward. You won't save him, but you're
scared to tell him why.  
TRICKY: What's he going on about?  
DOCTOR: Robots don't need blast suits. They don't need respirators. They don't
get frightened of monsters in the dark.  
TRICKY: What's he talking about?  
DOCTOR: Two bionic eyes and a synthetic voice box. But you, my friend, are
human. Flesh and blood.  
GREGOR: It was a joke.  
TRICKY: What?  
GREGOR: It was just a stupid joke. We did it to relieve the boredom.  
DOCTOR: Well, it was very funny. They lied to you. Changed your identity just
to provide some in-flight entertainment.  
GREGOR: I'm sorry. You're human, Tricky.  
DOCTOR: Cut the metal. Cut the metal! Go!

**[Outside the Eye of Harmony]**

GREGOR: Where are we?  
DOCTOR: Power source. Right, you lot, wait here. I'll check it's safe. We can
only survive for a minute or two in there.  
CLARA: Er, what happens if we stay longer?  
DOCTOR: Our cells with liquefy and our skin will start to burn.  
CLARA: I always feel so good after we've spoken.  
DOCTOR: Marvellous. Keep this door shut.  
CLARA: That will not be a problem.  
(The Doctor enters the room. Gregor scans Clara.)  
COMPUTER: Lancashire. Sass.  
GREGOR: Intelligent sensor.  
TRICKY: Ever pointed that thing at yourself, Gregor? What would it see? What
sort of person does this to another human? Made them believe they're made of
metal. Who am I?  
(Gregor rips a patch off his suit. Van Baalen Bros. The Doctor runs through
the engine room and pulls open a door on the other side.)  
GREGOR: My mouthy little kid brother.  
TRICKY: Why, why can't I remember?  
GREGOR: It was a salvage accident. There was a big explosion. You lost your
sight, voice and your memory.  
TRICKY: And you, you thought of a way you could have some fun with me? I just
wanted a brother beside me!  
GREGOR: You were always the smart one, Tricky. He wanted you to take over. He
made you captain.  
TRICKY: He?  
GREGOR: Dad.  
TRICKY: I don't remember him. You did this to me just to be captain of a heap
of junk.  
(Tricky attacks Gregor.)  
DOCTOR: Stop! Tricky, listen to me. Ask yourself why he couldn't cut you up.
He has just one tiny scrap of decency left in him, and you helped him find
that, okay? Now you. Don't ever forget this.

**[Eye of Harmony]**

(Very orange atmosphere.)  
DOCTOR: Okay, move, move, move.  
(They all run onto the catwalk.)  
DOCTOR: The Eye of Harmony. Exploding star in the act of becoming a black
hole. Time Lord engineering. You rip the star from its orbit, suspend it in a
permanent state of decay. This way, quickly.  
(But there is a creature behind the other door. And the female is at the one
they have just come through.)  
GREGOR: There's no way out. We're trapped.  
CLARA: You're going to tell me right now. If we're going to die here, you're
going to tell me what they are.  
DOCTOR: I can't.  
CLARA: Tell me. What's the use in secrets now?  
DOCTOR: Secrets protect us. Secrets make us safe.  
CLARA: We're not safe!  
COMPUTER: Sensor detects animal DNA. Human core element. Calculating data.
Calculating data.  
DOCTOR: No, no, turn it off!  
COMPUTER: Lancashire. Sass. Identifiable substance. Clara.  
CLARA: That's me.  
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry.  
CLARA: It's me. I burn in here.  
DOCTOR: It isn't just the past leaking out through the time rift. It's the
future. Listen, I brought you here to keep you safe, but it happened again.
You died again.  
CLARA: What do you mean, again?  
(Tricky and Gregor are trying to keep the door closed against another
creature.)  
DOCTOR: Hang on. As long as we can interrupt the timeline, this can't happen.
Don't touch each other, otherwise the future will reassert itself.  
(He pulls them back, and the creature breaks in. It claws at Gregor's backpack
with the light bulb in it.)  
DOCTOR: Gregor, Gregor, let go of the circuit.  
TRICKY: Just let it go.  
DOCTOR: Gregor, Gregor.  
(Tricky knocks this creature off the catwalk. Presumably it is future burnt
Doctor or maybe Bram, although he is already dead. Then the conjoined creature
and burnt Clara break in.)  
DOCTOR: Okay. Er, er  
(Tricky attacks the conjoined creature, kicking it off the catwalk. He is left
dangling.)  
GREGOR: Tricky!  
CLARA: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: No, don't touch him, or time will reassert itself.  
(Gregor pulls Tricky up onto the catwalk and they change into the conjoined
creature. The Doctor and Clara get out just in time.)

**[Engine room]**

DOCTOR: The engine room. The heart of the Tardis.  
(They run forward to the edge of a cliff.)  
CLARA: We're outside.  
DOCTOR: No, we're still in the Tardis.  
CLARA: There's no way across.  
DOCTOR: No, okay, you're right.  
CLARA: So what do we do? Time for a plan. Do you have a plan?  
DOCTOR: Well, no. No plan. Sorry.  
CLARA: If you don't have a plan, we're dead.  
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. So just tell me.  
CLARA: Tell you what?  
DOCTOR: Well, there's no point now. We're about to die. Just tell me who you
are.  
CLARA: You know who I am.  
DOCTOR: No, I don't. I look at you every single day and I don't understand a
thing about you. Why do I keep running into you?  
CLARA: Doctor, you invited me. You said  
DOCTOR: Before that. I met you in the Dalek Asylum. There was a girl in a
shipwreck and she died saving my life, and she was you.  
CLARA: She really wasn't.  
DOCTOR: Victorian London. There was a governess who was really a barmaid, and
we fought the Great Intelligence together. She died and it was my fault, and
she was you.  
CLARA: You're scaring me.  
DOCTOR: What are you, eh? Are you a trick, a trap?  
CLARA: I don't know what you're talking about!  
(And nearly steps back off the edge of the cliff. The Doctor grabs her and
holds her tight in his arms.)  
DOCTOR: You really don't, do you.  
CLARA: I think I'm more scared of you right now than anything else on that
Tardis.  
DOCTOR: You're just Clara, aren't you.  
(Another hug.)  
CLARA: Okay, I don't know what the hell this is about, but the hug is really
nice.  
DOCTOR: We're not going to die here. This isn't real! It's a snarl.  
CLARA: What?  
DOCTOR: What does a wounded animal do? It tries to scare everyone away. We're
close to the engine. The Tardis is snarling at us, trying to frighten us off.
We need to jump.  
CLARA: You're insane.  
DOCTOR: We'll cross a portal to the engine.  
CLARA: How can you be so sure?  
DOCTOR: I can't.  
CLARA: Okay, well, that's watertight.  
DOCTOR: Hey now, Clara, I have piloted this ship for over nine hundred years.
Trust me this one time, please. Okay. Okay. As well as all the other times.
Ready? Geronimo.  
(They run and jump off the edge of the cliff into a white space filled with
pieces of metal frozen in time as they travel out from an explosion.)  
DOCTOR: The heart of the Tardis. The engine, it's already exploded. It must
have been the collision with the salvage ship.  
CLARA: We're not dead.  
DOCTOR: She wrapped her hands around the force. Froze it.  
CLARA: So, so it's safe?  
DOCTOR: Temporary fix. Eventually this whole place will erupt. There's no way
I can save her now. She's just always been there for me, and taken care of me,
and now it's my turn and I don't know what to do. I think it just  
(Clara takes his hand, and he sees the burn marks on it.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, Clara. Oh.  
(She has Big Friendly Button burnt into her palm.)  
DOCTOR: You are beautiful. Beautiful fragile human skin. Like parchment. Thank
you. The rift in time. All the memories leaking out. I need to find the moment
we crashed. I need to find the music.

**[Under the time console]**

(With the music that the Brothers were playing as they used their magno-grab.
There is a vertical crack in the wall with bright light streaming through.)  
DOCTOR: The time rift. Recent past, possible future.  
CLARA: What are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: Rewrite today, I hope.  
(He uses the sonic screwdriver to etch the letters onto the grenade.)  
DOCTOR: I've thrown this through the rift before. I need to make sure this
time. Going to take it in there myself. There might be a certain amount of
yelling.  
CLARA: It's going to hurt?  
DOCTOR: Things that end your life often do that.  
CLARA: Wait! All those things you said. How we've met before, how I died.  
DOCTOR: Clara, don't worry. You'll forget. Time mends us. It can mend
anything.  
CLARA: I don't want to forget. Not all of it. The library. I saw it. You were
mentioned in a book.  
DOCTOR: I'm mentioned in a lot of books.  
CLARA: You call yourself Doctor. Why do you do that? You have a name. I've
seen it. In one corner of that tiny  
DOCTOR: If I rewrite today, you won't remember. You won't go looking for my
name.  
CLARA: You'll still have secrets.  
DOCTOR: It's better that way.  
(The Doctor forces his way through the crack in the wall, screaming as he
pushes against an immense force until he suddenly vanishes.)

**[Tardis]**

(And back to the start of the show, near enough.)  
DOCTOR: Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stay by me.  
CLARA: Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Big friendly button.  
CLARA: You're lying.  
DOCTOR: Yep.  
CLARA: To stop me freaking out?  
DOCTOR: Is it working?  
CLARA: Not so much.  
(The future Doctor pushes through the crack.)  
FUTURE DOCTOR: Doctor, Doctor. I'm from your future. We haven't got long to
reset time.  
(He vanishes. The grenade rolls across the floor to Clara. She picks it up.)  
DOCTOR: Clara, no! No!  
(The Doctor catches the grenade as she drops it.)  
DOCTOR: Ah ha! Big friendly button.  
(He hits it. Whiteout.)

**[Salvage ship]**

(The Tardis vanishes from their radar.)  
TRICKY: I don't get it. It was on screen, then it was gone.  
BRAM: Hey, robot, go get me some food. I'm starving.  
GREGOR: Oi, leave him alone.  
BRAM: What's the matter with you?  
GREGOR: Maybe I've just got a little tiny scrap of decency.  
(On the wall is the whole photograph - the father and his three sons.)

**[Tardis]**

(The reset is complete. The encounter with the Van Baalen Brothers salvage
ship never happened. Clara is drying her hair.)  
CLARA: I feel exhausted. I feel  
DOCTOR: We've had two days crammed into the space of one.  
CLARA: Why would you say that?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. I say stuff. Ignore me. Do you feel safe?  
CLARA: Of course.  
DOCTOR: Give me a number out of ten. Ten being whoo hoo, one being argh.  
CLARA: You're being weird.  
DOCTOR: I need to know if you feel safe. I need to know you're not afraid.  
CLARA: Of?  
DOCTOR: The future. Running away with a spaceman in a box. Anything could
happen to you.  
CLARA: That's what I'm counting on. Push the button.
