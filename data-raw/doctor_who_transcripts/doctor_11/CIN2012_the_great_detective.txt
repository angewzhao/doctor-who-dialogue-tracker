**[London]**

(Snowing.)  
NARRATOR [OC]: In London in the time of Queen Victoria, there were many tales
of a remarkable personage known as the Great Detective. I refer, of course, to
Madame Vastra, the lizard woman of Paternoster Row and her extraordinary
adventures, her beautiful assistant, Jenny Flint, and their mysterious
henchman, Strax, whose countenance was too abominable to be photographed.
There are also accounts of a fourth member of the Paternoster Gang, a shadowy
figure whose assistance was only sought in the direst emergencies.  
VASTRA: I'm so glad you came. We have news, I think, of particular interest to
you. There was a meteor shower in the southwest, unexpected timing and
density. I've calculated there is a thirty four percent chance it is the
result of alien intervention. Twenty four percent. Well, they could just be
meteors but it is worth looking in to. There is a very pleasant tea room in
the area.  
JENNY: Also, there's a Professor Arasmus Pink who's claiming he's going to
split the world open with a giant drill through the thinnest part of the
Earth's crust. I think we should investigate. I mean, he doesn't actually have
a giant drill, and he's not really a professor, and he was a bit drunk at the
time and singing a bit, but you know it is never too early to investigate a
drill.  
STRAX: I've declared war on the moon.  
VASTRA: Do be quiet, Strax.  
STRAX: Too long the moon has hung unmonitored and unsuspected in the sky. It
has gained an enormous tactical advantage.  
JENNY: There's no one living there.  
STRAX: Then it is clearly time to act. They won't suspect a thing.  
JENNY: Who won't suspect a thing?  
STRAX: Moonites.  
DOCTOR: Why do you keep doing this? What is the point? I have told you. I keep
telling you, I don't do this any more. I've retired.  
JENNY: There's a man on Praed Street with an invisible wife. Maybe he just
doesn't have a wife.  
DOCTOR: You're wasting my time.  
(The Doctor walks past them.)  
JENNY: Merry Christmas!  
(And out of sight.)  
JENNY: I think he means it.  
VASTRA: Yes, my dear, I rather think he does.  
STRAX: Damn moon.
