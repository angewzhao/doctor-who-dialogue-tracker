Original Airdate: 17 Dec, 2012  

**[Hallway]**

(Strax the Sontaran Butler is putting handcuffs on a man.)  
STRAX: Prepare for obliteration, Earthling scum.  
INSPECTOR: Actually, Mister Strax, if you could just take him aside for a
moment, I have some officers on the way.  
STRAX: As you wish. Humans.  
JENNY: Sorry. He is new.  
INSPECTOR: Funny looking fellow but, Turkish, is he?  
VASTRA: He is a genetically modified clone warrior from outer space.  
INSPECTOR: Ah. Makes sense. Well, what a case. Identical twins, poison
undetectable to science, an ancient Egyptian curse. Once more Scotland Yard is
in your debt, Madame Vastra. Where would we be without you?  
VASTRA: Quite some distance from a clue, one imagines.  
INSPECTOR: You might be right. Does it ever hurt?  
VASTRA: Does what hurt?  
INSPECTOR: Your skin condition. Always wondered.  
JENNY: It's not a condition, Inspector. It's just skin.  
INSPECTOR: Are you sure?  
VASTRA: I am, as I may have failed to mention, an intelligent reptile from an
ancient civilisation long preceding mankind. Many of us slumber under the
Earth's crust.  
JENNY: Madame was accidentally awoken by an extension to the London
Underground.  
INSPECTOR: Well, that would account for it.  
VASTRA: I was not initially keen on the society of apes, but I made the most
elementary of errors. I fell in love.  
(Vastra and Jenny gaze into each others eyes.)  
INSPECTOR: What, with the Turkish fellow?  
VASTRA: No. Not with the Turkish fellow.  
INSPECTOR: Good lord. Good lord.  
VASTRA: Come along, my dear.  
JENNY: Yes, my darling.  
INSPECTOR: Good lord.

**[Carriage]**

JENNY: Still no word from the Doctor, then?  
VASTRA: No, my dear. And there won't be.  
JENNY: He can't sulk in his box forever.  
VASTRA: Heartbreak is a burden to us all. Pity the man with two.  
JENNY: It's starting to snow.  
VASTRA: But it can't be.  
JENNY: Well, it is nearly Christmas.  
VASTRA: But the clouds.  
JENNY: What about them?  
VASTRA: There aren't any.
