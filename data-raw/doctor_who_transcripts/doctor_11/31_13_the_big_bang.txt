**The Big Bang**  
  
Original Airdate: 26 Jun, 2010  

**[Amy's bedroom]**

(1,894 years later... and one star at least is still burning brightly.  
Night. The red pinwheel turns in the breeze in the garden. Upstairs, a little
red haired girl is saying her prayers.)  
AMELIA: Dear Santa. Thank you for the dolls and pencils and the fish. It's
Easter now, so I hope I don't wake you, but, honest, it is an emergency.
There's a crack in my wall. Aunt Sharon says it's just an ordinary crack, but
I know it's not, because at night there's voices. So, please, please, could
you send someone to fix it, or a policeman, or  
(A strange wind whistles outside.)  
AMELIA: Back in a moment.  
(She runs to the window, but there is nothing there. The moon hangs in a
starless sky.)

**[Living room]**

(The nice lady psychiatrist is looking at a painting of the moon and stars.)  
CHRISTINE: It's a lovely painting, Amelia. And what are all these?  
AMELIA: Stars.  
SHARON: Oh, Amelia.  
CHRISTINE: Tell you what, shall we go outside?

**[Outside the house]**

CHRISTINE: What do you see, Amelia?  
AMELIA: The moon.  
CHRISTINE: And what else?  
AMELIA: Just the dark.  
CHRISTINE: But no stars. If there were stars up there, we'd be able to see
them, wouldn't we? Amelia, look at me. You know this is all just a story,
don't you? You know there's no such thing as stars.

**[Amy's bedroom]**

(Amy listens to the adult voices downstairs.)  
CHRISTINE [OC]: But there's bound to be a bit of her that feels alone.
Amelia's a really good person.

**[Staircase]**

CHRISTINE [OC]: It's quite common, actually. Throughout history, people have
talked about seeing stars in the sky. God knows where it comes from.  
SHARON [OC]: I just don't want her growing up and joining one of those Star
Cults. I don't trust that Richard Dawkins.  
(Christine and Sharon walk across the hallway from the kitchen to the living
room. Someone in a red fez puts a leaflet through the door. Amelia runs down
to get it. It is titled The Anomaly, and features the Pandorica at the
National Museum. Someone has written on it in red ink \- Come along, Pond.)

**[National Museum]**

AMELIA: Come on, Aunt Sharon.  
SHARON: Oh, look at that. That's good, isn't it?  
AMELIA: Not that. This way.  
SHARON; But we're not looking at anything.  
AMELIA: This way!  
SHARON: Amelia!

**[Anomaly Exhibition]**

(Amelia stops to look at the exhibit of petrified Daleks, then pushes through
the people standing looking at the Pandorica. Someone snatches her Original
Cola drink from her. Suddenly there is a post-it note on the Pandorica, saying
Stick around, Pond.)  
SHARON [OC]: Amelia!  
(Amelia runs to hide.)  
SHARON: Amelia? Amelia?  
(Closing time.)  
SHARON; Amelia!  
TANNOY: Amelia Pond, please go to the reception, please. Your aunt is waiting
for you there. Amelia Pond, please go to reception.  
(Later still, Amelia creeps out from the Penguin display, knocking some over.)  
AMELIA: Sorry.  
(She returns to the Pandorica and removes the post-it note. He puts her hand
on the Pandorica and starts to open. Amelia backs away. The person inside
speaks to her.)  
AMY: Okay, kid. This is where it gets complicated.

**[Stonehenge]**

(1,894 years previously... Rory has the body of Amy lying across his lap,
Pieta-style.)  
RORY: So the universe ended. You missed that, in 102 AD. I suppose this means
you and I never get born at all. Twice, in my case. You would have laughed at
that. Please laugh. The Doctor said the universe was huge and ridiculous, and
sometimes there were miracles. I could do with a ridiculous miracle about now.  
(The Doctor pops in from thin air, wearing a red fez and carrying a mop.)  
DOCTOR: Rory! Listen, she's not dead. Well, she is dead, but it's not the end
of the world. Well, it is the end of the world. Actually, it's the end of the
universe. Oh, no. Hang on.  
(The Doctor vanishes again.)  
RORY: Doctor? Doctor!  
(He reappears, without the mop.)  
DOCTOR: You need to get me out of the Pandorica.  
RORY: But you're not in the Pandorica.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. Well, I'm not now, but I was back then. Well, back now from
your point of view, which is back then from my point of view. Time travel, you
can't keep it straight in your head. It's easy to open from the outside. Just
point and press.  
(The Doctor gives Rory his sonic screwdriver.)  
DOCTOR: Now go.  
(The Doctor vanishes and returns.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, and when you're done, leave my screwdriver in her top pocket. Good
luck.  
(And vanishes again.)  
RORY: What do you mean? Done what?

**[Pandorica chamber]**

(Rory opens the Pandorica with the sonic screwdriver. The Doctor is released
from the chair.)  
DOCTOR: How did you do that?  
RORY: You gave me this.  
(The Doctor takes his screwdriver from his own pocket.)  
DOCTOR: No, I didn't.  
RORY: You did. Look at it.  
(The Doctor touches his screwdriver to Rory's. They spark.)  
DOCTOR: Temporal energy. Same screwdriver at different points in its own time
stream. Which means it was me who gave it to you. Me from the future. I've got
a future. That's nice. That's not.  
(The Daleks are fossilised.)  
RORY: Yeah. What are they?  
(Everyone who was in the chamber when the universe ended has been fossilised.)  
DOCTOR: History has collapsed. Whole races have been deleted from existence.
These are just like after-images. Echoes. Fossils in time. The footprints of
the never-were.  
RORY: Er, what does that mean?  
DOCTOR: Total event collapse. The universe literally never happened.  
RORY: So, how can we be here? What's keeping us safe?  
DOCTOR: Nothing. Eye of the storm, that's all. We're just the last light to go
out. Amy. Where's Amy?

**[Stonehenge]**

RORY: I killed her.  
DOCTOR: Oh, Rory.  
RORY: Doctor, what am I?  
DOCTOR: You're a Nestene duplicate. A lump of plastic with delusions of
humanity.  
RORY: But I'm Rory now. Whatever was happening, it's stopped. I'm Rory.  
DOCTOR: That's software talking.  
RORY: Can you help her? Is there anything you can do?  
DOCTOR: Yeah, probably, if I had the time.  
RORY: The time?  
DOCTOR: All of creation has just been wiped from the sky. Do you know how many
lives now never happened? All the people who never lived? Your girlfriend
isn't more important than the whole universe.  
(Rory punches the Doctor.)  
RORY: She is to me!  
DOCTOR: Welcome back, Rory Williams! Sorry. Had to be sure. Hell of a gun-arm
you're packing there. Right, we need to get her downstairs. And take that look
off your plastic face. You're getting married in the morning.

**[Pandorica chamber]**

(The Doctor places Amy in the Pandorica.)  
RORY: So you've got a plan, then?  
DOCTOR: Bit of a plan, yeah. Memories are more powerful than you think, and
Amy Pond is not an ordinary girl. Grew up with a time crack in her wall. The
universe pouring through her dreams every night. The Nestenes took a memory
print of her and got a bit more than they bargained for, like you. Not just
your face, but your heart and your soul.  
(The Doctor mind-melds with Amy.)  
DOCTOR: I'm leaving her a message for when she wakes up, so she knows what's
happening.  
(The Doctor seals Amy inside the Pandorica.)  
RORY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: I'm saving her. This box is the ultimate prison. You can't even escape
by dying. It forces you to stay alive.  
RORY: But she's already dead.  
DOCTOR: Well, she's mostly dead. The Pandorica can stasis-lock her that way.
Now, all it needs is a scan of her living DNA and it'll restore her.  
RORY: Where's it going to get that?  
DOCTOR: In about two thousand years.

**[Anomaly Exhibition]**

(Amy falls out of the Pandorica, gasping.)  
AMELIA: Are you all right? Who are you?  
AMY: I'm fine. I'm supposed to rest. Got to rest, the Doctor says.  
AMELIA: What doctor?  
(Amy taps her head.)  
DOCTOR: He's in here. Left a message in my head like I'm an answerphone. Where
am I? Hang on. National Museum, right? I was here once when I was a little  
(And the penny drops.)  
AMY: Yeah, complicated. Let's see, it's what, 1996?  
AMELIA: Who are you?  
AMY: It's a long story. Oh. A very long story.  
(The Pandorica Seen Through Time is on a display board. 118AD taken back to
Rome under armed guard. 420AD Raided by the Franks. 1120AD Prized possession
of the Knights Templar. 1231 Donated to the Vatican.)

**[Pandorica chamber]**

(The Doctor takes River's vortex manipulator from her bag and straps it to his
wrist.)  
RORY: She's going to be in that box for two thousand years?  
DOCTOR: Yeah, but we're taking a shortcut. River's vortex manipulator. Rubbish
way to time travel, but the universe is tiny now. We'll be fine.  
RORY: So hang on. The future's still there, then. Our world.  
DOCTOR: A version of it. Not quite the one you know. Earth alone in the sky.
Let's go and have a look. You put your hand there. Don't worry. Should be
safe.  
RORY: That's not what I'm worried about.  
DOCTOR: She'll be fine. Nothing can get into this box.  
RORY: Well, you got in there.  
DOCTOR: Well, there's only one of me. I counted.  
RORY: This box needs a guard. I killed the last one.  
DOCTOR: No. Rory, no. Don't even think about it.  
RORY: She'll be all alone.  
DOCTOR: She won't feel it.  
RORY: You bet she won't.  
DOCTOR: Two thousand years, Rory. You won't even sleep. you'd be conscious
every second. It would drive you mad.  
RORY: Will she be safer if I stay? Look me in the eye and tell me she wouldn't
be safer.  
DOCTOR: Rory, you  
RORY: Answer me!  
DOCTOR: Yes. Obviously.  
RORY: Then how could I leave her?  
DOCTOR: Why do you have to be so human?  
RORY: Because right now, I'm not.  
DOCTOR: Listen to me. This is the last bit of advice you're going to get in a
very long time. You're living plastic, but you're not immortal. I have no idea
how long you'll last. And you're not indestructible. Stay away from heat and
radio signals when they come along. You can't heal, or repair yourself. Any
damage is permanent. So, for God's sake, however bored you get, stay out of  
(The Doctor vanishes. Rory puts on his helmet, draws his sword and settles
down to the longest stint of guard duty in history.)  
NARRATOR [OC]: According to legend, wherever the Pandorica was taken,
throughout its long history, the Centurion would be there, guarding it.

**[Anomaly Exhibition]**

(An audio visual presentation of the history of the Pandorica on a nearby
screen.)  
NARRATOR [OC]: He appears as an iconic image in the artwork of many cultures,
and there are several documented accounts of his appearances, and his warnings
to the many who attempted to open the box before its time. His last recorded
appearance was during the London blitz in 1941. The warehouse where the
Pandorica was stored was destroyed by incendiary bombs, but the box itself was
found the next morning, a safe distance from the blaze. There are eyewitness
accounts from the night of the fire of a figure in Roman dress, carrying the
box from the flames. Since then, there have been no sightings of the Lone
Centurion, and many have speculated that if he ever existed, he perished in
the fires of that night, performing one last act of devotion to the box he had
pledged to protect for nearly two thousand years.  
AMY: Rory. Oh, Rory.  
DALEK: Exterminate!  
AMELIA: What's that?  
DALEK: Exterminate!  
(The Doctor appears.)  
DOCTOR: Trouble. Oh. Ah, two of you. Complicated.  
DALEK: Exterminate! Weapons systems restoring.  
DOCTOR: Come along, Ponds.  
DALEK: Exterminate!  
(They run to a Middle Eastern montage where the Doctor takes the fez from a
dummy.)  
AMY: What are we doing?  
DOCTOR: Well, we are running into a dead end, where I'll have a brilliant
plan, that basically involves not being in one.  
MAN: What's going on?  
DOCTOR: Get out of here. Go! Just run!  
DALEK: Drop the device!  
(The man only has a torch.)  
DOCTOR: It's not a weapon. Scan it. It's not a weapon, and you don't have the
power to waste.  
DALEK: Scans indicate intruder unarmed.  
(The man drops the torch. It is Rory in a museum guard uniform.)  
RORY: Do you think?  
(He shoots it with his Auton hand weapon.)  
DALEK: Vision impaired! Vision  
(The Dalek stops.)  
RORY: Amy!  
AMY: Rory.  
(Joyful reunion.)  
RORY: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. It just happened.  
AMY: Oh, Shut up.  
(Amy kisses Rory.)  
DOCTOR: Yeah, shut up, because we've got to go. Come on.  
RORY: I waited. Two thousand years I waited for you.  
AMY: No, still shut up.  
DOCTOR: And break. And breathe. Well, somebody didn't get out much for two
thousand years.  
AMELIA: I'm thirsty. Can I get a drink?  
DOCTOR: Oh, it's all mouths today, isn't it. The light. The light from the
Pandorica, it must have hit the Dalek.  
(The Dalek's weapon starts to move.)  
DOCTOR: Out! Out! Out!

**[Museum Reception]**

DOCTOR: So, two thousand years. How did you do?  
RORY: Kept out of trouble.  
DOCTOR: Oh. How?  
RORY: Unsuccessfully. The mop! That's how you looked all those years ago when
you gave me the sonic.  
DOCTOR: Ah. Well, no time to lose, then.

**[Stonehenge]**

DOCTOR: Rory! Listen, she's not dead. Well, she is dead, but it's not the end
of the world.

**[Museum Reception]**

(The Doctor returns and puts the mop through the door handles to the Anomaly
exhibition.)  
DOCTOR: Oops, sorry.  
AMELIA: How can he do that? Is he magic?

**[Stonehenge]**

DOCTOR: You need to get me out of the Pandorica.  
RORY: But you're not in the Pandorica.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. Well, I'm not now, but I was back then.

**[Museum Reception]**

DOCTOR: Right, let's go then. Wait! Now I don't have the sonic. I just gave it
Rory two thousand years ago.

**[Stonehenge]**

DOCTOR: And when you're done, leave my screwdriver in her top pocket.

**[Museum Reception]**

DOCTOR: Right then.  
(The Doctor retrieves his screwdriver.)  
DOCTOR: Off we go! No, hang on. How did you know to come here?  
(Amelia shows him the leaflet and the post-it note.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, my handwriting. Okay.  
(He grabs a new leaflet and post-it note from the information desk and
vanishes. He returns with the drink he took from Amelia earlier.)  
DOCTOR: There you go. Drink up.  
AMY: What is that? How are you doing that?  
DOCTOR: Vortex manipulator. Cheap and nasty time travel. Very bad for you. I'm
trying to give it up.  
AMY: Where are we going?  
DOCTOR: The roof.  
(A second Doctor appears further up the stairs, sans fez, and falls down them.
His clothes are smoking.)  
RORY: Doctor, it's you. How can it be you?  
AMY: Doctor, is that you?  
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's me. Me from the future.  
(Future Doctor suddenly wakes up and whispers in the Doctor's ear, then falls
back again.)  
AMY: Are you? I mean, is he, is he dead?  
DOCTOR: What? Dead? Yes, yes. Of course he's dead. Right, I've got twelve
minutes. That's good.  
AMY: Twelve minutes to live? How is that good?  
DOCTOR: Oh, you can do loads in twelve minutes. Suck a mint, buy a sledge,
have a fast bath. Come on, the roof.  
RORY: We can't leave you here dead.  
DOCTOR: Oh, good. Are you in charge now? So tell me, what are we going to do
about Amelia?  
AMY: Where did she go?  
RORY: Amelia?  
DOCTOR: There is no Amelia. From now on, there never was. History is still
collapsing.  
AMY: But how can I still be here if she's not?  
DOCTOR: You're an anomaly. We all are. We're all just hanging on at the eye of
the storm. But the eye is closing, and if we don't do something fast, reality
will never have happened. Today, just dying is a result. Now, come on!  
AMY: He won't die. Time can be rewritten. He'll find a way. I know he will.  
(Rory covers the dead Doctor with his jacket.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Move it! Come on!  
DALEK: Restore. Restore!

**[Roof]**

AMY; What, it's morning already? How did that happen?  
DOCTOR: History is shrinking. Is anybody listening to me? The universe is
collapsing. We don't have much time left.  
(The Doctor sonicks a satellite receiver dish off its pole.)  
RORY: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Looking for the Tardis.  
RORY: But the Tardis exploded.  
DOCTOR: Okay then, I'm looking for an exploding Tardis.  
AMY: I don't understand. So, the Tardis blew up and took the universe with it.
But why would it do that? How?  
DOCTOR: Good question for another day. The question for now is, total event
collapse means that every star in the universe never happened. Not one single
one of them ever shone. So, if all the stars that ever were are gone, then
what is that?  
(A large burning ball in the sky.)  
DOCTOR: Like I said, I'm looking for an exploding Tardis.  
RORY: But that's the sun.  
DOCTOR: Is it? Well, here's the noise that sun is making right now.  
(The Tardis noise.)  
DOCTOR: That's my Tardis burning up. That's what's been keeping the Earth
warm.  
RORY: Doctor, there's something else.  
RIVER [OC]: I'm sorry, my love.  
RORY: There's a voice.  
AMY: I can't hear anything.  
RORY: Trust the plastic.  
RIVER [OC]: I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry, my love.  
AMY: Doctor, that's River. How can she be up there?  
RORY: It must be like a recording or something.  
DOCTOR: No, it's not. Of course, the emergency protocols. The Tardis has
sealed off the control room and put her into a time loop to save her. She is
right at the heart of the explosion.  
RIVER [OC]: I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry, my love.

**[Tardis]**

(River is forever running to the doors, opening them and seeing the rock
wall.)  
RIVER: I'm sorry, my love.  
(Scene repeats, then the Doctor is standing there.)  
DOCTOR: Hi, honey. I'm home.  
RIVER: And what sort of time do you call this?

**[Rooftop]**

RIVER: Amy! And the plastic Centurion?  
DOCTOR: It's okay, he's on our side.  
RIVER: Really?  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
RIVER: I dated a Nestene duplicate once. Swappable head. It did keep things
fresh. Right then, I have questions, but number one is this. What in the name
of sanity have you got on your head?  
DOCTOR: It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.  
(Amy snatches the fez and throws it into the air, where River shoots it into
pieces.)  
DOCTOR: Oh!  
(Then the Dalek rises up above the parapet.)  
DALEK: Exterminate!  
DOCTOR: Run, run! Move, move. Go!  
RORY: Come on!  
(The Doctor uses the satellite dish as a shield and they get back into the
museum.)

**[Roof access]**

RIVER: Doctor, come on.  
DOCTOR: Shush. It's moving away, finding another way in. It needs to restore
its power before it can attack again. Now, that means we've got exactly four
and a half minutes before it's at lethal capacity.  
RORY: How do you know?  
DOCTOR: Because that's when it's due to kill me.  
RIVER: Kill you? What do you mean, kill you?  
DOCTOR: Oh, shut up. Never mind. How can that Dalek even exist? It was erased
from time and then it came back.

**[Upper corridor]**

DOCTOR: How?  
RORY: You said the light from the Pandorica  
DOCTOR: It's not a light, it's a restoration field. But never mind, call it a
light. That light brought Amy back, restored her, but how could it bring back
a Dalek when the Daleks have never existed?  
AMY: Okay, tell us.  
DOCTOR: When the Tardis blew up, it caused a total event collapse. A time
explosion. And that explosion blasted every atom in every moment of the
universe. Except  
AMY: Except inside the Pandorica.  
DOCTOR: The perfect prison. And inside it, perfectly preserved, a few billion
atoms of the universe as it was. In theory, you could extrapolate the whole
universe from a single one of them, like, like cloning a body from a single
cell. And we've got the bumper family pack.  
RORY: No, no. Too fast. I'm not getting it.  
DOCTOR: The box contains a memory of the universe, and the light transmits the
memory, and that's how we're going to do it.  
AMY: Do what?  
DOCTOR: Relight the fire. Reboot the universe. Come on!  
RIVER: Doctor, you're being completely ridiculous. The Pandorica partially
restored one Dalek. If it can't even reboot a single life form properly, how's
it reboot the whole of reality?  
DOCTOR: What if we give it a moment of infinite power? What if we can transmit
the light from the Pandorica to every particle of space and time
simultaneously?  
RIVER: Well, that would be lovely, dear, but we can't, because it's completely
impossible.  
DOCTOR: Ah no, you see, it's not. It's almost completely impossible. One spark
is all we need.  
RIVER: For what?  
DOCTOR: Big Bang Two! Now listen.  
(The Dalek shoots the Doctor.)  
DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate!  
RORY: Get back. River, get back now!  
DALEK: Exterminate!  
(Rory shoots at the Dalek and it powers down again.)  
RIVER: Doctor? Doctor, it's me, River. Can you hear me? What is it? What do
you need?  
(The Doctor activates the vortex manipulator and vanishes.)  
RIVER: Where did he go? Damn it, he could be anywhere.  
AMY: He went downstairs, twelve minutes ago.  
RIVER: Show me!  
AMY: River, he died.  
DALEK: Systems restoring. You will be exterminated.  
RORY: We've got to move. That thing's coming back to life.  
RIVER: You go to the Doctor. I'll be right with you.  
(Amy and Rory leave.)  
DALEK: You will be exterminated!  
RIVER: Not yet. Your systems are still restoring, which means your shield
density is compromised. One Alpha Mezon burst through your eyestalk would kill
you stone dead.  
DALEK: Records indicate you will show mercy. You are an associate of the
Doctor's.  
RIVER: I'm River Song. Check your records again.  
DALEK: Mercy.  
RIVER: Say it again.  
DALEK: Mercy!  
RIVER: One more time.  
DALEK: Mercy!

**[Museum Reception]**

(The Doctor's body is not there, although Rory's jacket is.)  
RORY: How could he have moved? He was dead. Doctor? Doctor!  
AMY: But he was dead.  
RIVER: Who told you that?  
AMY: He did.  
RIVER: Rule one. The Doctor lies.  
AMY: Where's the Dalek?  
RIVER: It died.

**[Anomaly Exhibition]**

(The Doctor is in the Pandorica.)  
AMY: Doctor!  
RORY: Why did he tell us he was dead?  
AMY: We were a diversion. As long as the Dalek was chasing us, he could work
down here.  
RIVER: Doctor, can you hear me? What were you doing?  
(The light from the Tardis is getting brighter.)  
RORY: What's happening?  
RIVER: Reality's collapsing. It's speeding up. Look at this room.  
AMY: Where'd everything go?  
RIVER: History's being erased. Time's running out. Doctor, what were you
doing? Tell us. Doctor!  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Big Bang Two.  
RORY: The Big Bang. That's the beginning of the universe, right?  
AMY: What, and Big Bang Two is the bang that brings us back? Is that what you
mean?  
RIVER: Oh.  
AMY: What?  
RIVER: The Tardis is still burning. It's exploding at every point in history.
If you threw the Pandorica into the explosion, right into the heart of the
fire.  
AMY: Then what?  
RIVER: Then let there be light. The light from the Pandorica would explode
everywhere at once, just like he said.  
AMY: That would work? That would bring everything back?  
RIVER: A restoration field powered by an exploding Tardis, happening at every
moment in history. Oh, that's brilliant. It might even work. He's wired the
vortex manipulator to the rest of the box.  
AMY: Why?  
RIVER: So he can take it with him. He's going to fly the Pandorica into the
heart of the explosion.  
(A short time later.)  
RORY: Are you okay?  
AMY: Are you?  
RORY: No.  
AMY: Well, shut up then!  
RIVER: Amy, he wants to talk to you.  
AMY: So, what happens here? Big Bang Two? What happens to us?  
RIVER: We all wake up where we ought to be. None of this ever happens and we
don't remember it.  
AMY: River, tell me he comes back, too.  
RIVER: The Doctor will be the heart of the explosion.  
AMY: So?  
RIVER: So all the cracks in time will close, but he'll be on the wrong side,
trapped in the never-space, the void between the worlds. All memory of him
will be purged from the universe. He will never have been born. Now, please.
He wants to talk to you before he goes.  
AMY: Not to you?  
RIVER: He doesn't really know me yet. Now he never will.  
(Amy goes to the Pandorica. The Doctor is very weak.)  
AMY: Hi.  
DOCTOR: Amy Pond. The girl who waited all night in your garden. Was it worth
it?  
AMY: Shut up. Of course it was.  
DOCTOR: You asked me why I was taking you with me and I said, no reason. I was
lying.  
AMY: It's not important.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's the most important thing left in the universe. It's why I'm
doing this. Amy, your house was too big. That big, empty house, and just you.  
AMY: And Aunt Sharon.  
DOCTOR: Where were your mum and dad? Where was everybody who lived in that big
house?  
AMY: I lost my Mum and Dad.  
DOCTOR: How? What happened to them? Where did they go?  
AMY: I, I don't  
DOCTOR: It's okay, it's okay. Don't panic, it's not your fault.  
AMY: I don't even remember.  
DOCTOR: There was a crack in time in the wall of your bedroom, and it's been
eating away at your life for a long time now. Amy Pond, all alone. The girl
who didn't make sense. How could I resist?  
AMY: How could I just forget?  
DOCTOR: Nothing is ever forgotten. Not really. But you have to try.  
RIVER: Doctor! It's speeding up!  
(Amy puts the Doctor's sonic screwdriver in his pocket.)  
DOCTOR: There's going to be a very big bang. Big Bang Two. Try and remember
your family and they'll be there.  
AMY: How can I remember them if they never existed?  
DOCTOR: Because you're special. That crack in your wall, all that time, the
universe pouring into your head. You brought Rory back. You can bring them
back, too. You just remember and they'll be there.  
AMY: You won't.  
DOCTOR: You'll have your family back. You won't need your imaginary friend any
more. Ha! Amy Pond crying over me, eh? Guess what?  
AMY: What?  
DOCTOR: Gotcha.  
(The Pandorica closes.)  
RIVER: Back! Get back!  
(The Pandorica takes off. River gets a text message.)  
RIVER: It's from the Doctor.  
AMY: What does it say?  
RIVER: Geronimo.  
(The Pandorica reaches the Tardis. There is another explosion then everything
reverses back to the start of the previous episode.)

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor sits up on the floor of the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: Oh! Okay. I escaped, then. Brilliant. I love it when I do that. Legs,
yes. Bow tie, cool. I can buy a fez.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Lyle beach. The beach is the best. Automatic sand.  
AMY [OC]: Automatic sand? What does that mean?  
DOCTOR [OC]: It's automated. Totally.  
DOCTOR: Oh.  
DOCTOR 2: Cleans up the lolly sticks all by itself.  
DOCTOR: No, hang on. That's last week when we went to Space Florida. I'm
rewinding. My, my time stream unravelling, erasing. Closing.  
(The crack in the scanner slowly closes and disappears.)  
DOCTOR: Hello, universe. Goodbye, Doctor. Amy. Amy.  
(And back through The Lodger.)

**[Aickman Street]**

DOCTOR: Ah, three weeks ago, when she put the card in the window. Amy! I need
to tell you something. She can hear me. But if she can hear me  
(There is a crack in the road. And back to )

**[Maze of the Dead]**

DOCTOR 2: Good luck, everyone. Behave. Do not let that girl open her eyes.
Amy, later. River, going to need your computer.  
DOCTOR: Amy, you need to start trusting me. It's never been more important.  
AMY: But you don't always tell me the truth.  
DOCTOR: If I always told you the truth, I wouldn't need you to trust me.  
AMY: Doctor, the crack in my wall. How can it be here?  
DOCTOR: I don't know yet but I'm working it out. Now, listen. Remember what I
told you when you were seven?  
AMY: What did you tell me?  
DOCTOR: No. No, that's not the point. You have to remember.  
AMY: Remember what? Doctor? Doctor?

**[Amy's home]**

(And back to the start of the season.)  
DOCTOR: Amelia's house. When she was seven. The night she waited.

**[Outside Amy's home]**

(Little Amelia has fallen asleep outside, lying on her suitcase.)  
DOCTOR: The girl who waited. Come here, you.

**[Amy's bedroom]**

(He puts her to bed.)  
DOCTOR: It's funny. I thought if you could hear me, I could hang on somehow.
Silly me. Silly old Doctor. When you wake up, you'll have a mum and dad, and
you won't even remember me. Well, you'll remember me a little. I'll be a story
in your head. But that's okay. We're all stories in the end. Just make it a
good one, eh? Because it was, you know. It was the best. The daft old man who
stole a magic box and ran away. Did I ever tell you that I stole it? Well, I
borrowed it. I was always going to take it back. Oh, that box. Amy, you'll
dream about that box. It'll never leave you. Big and little at the same time.
Brand new and ancient, and the bluest blue ever. And the times we had, eh?
Would have had. Never had. In your dreams, they'll still be there. The Doctor
and Amy Pond, and the days that never came. The cracks are closing. But they
can't close properly until I'm on the other side. I don't belong here any
more. I think I'll skip the rest of the rewind. I hate repeats. Live well.
Love Rory. Bye bye, Pond.  
(The Doctor goes through the crack in the wall. It closes. Amelia wakes up,
looks around and goes back to sleep while the stars twinkle in the sky.  
Grown up Amy is woken by the bright sunlight. She still has her Doctor doll on
the chest of drawers and her wedding dress hanging on the open wardrobe door.
A woman enters with a tray.)  
TABETHA: Morning!  
AMY: You're my mum. Oh, my God. You're my mum.  
TABETHA: Well, of course I'm your mum. What's the matter with you? And this is
your breakfast, which your father made, so feel free to tip it out of the
window if it's an atrocity. Downstairs, ten minutes? Big day!  
(Tabetha leaves.)  
AMY: Of course she's my mum. Why is that surprising?

**[Living room]**

AUGUSTUS: Ah, Amelia. I fear I may have been using the same joke book as the
best man.  
AMY: You're my tiny little dad!  
TABETHA: Amelia, why are you behaving as if you've never seen us before?  
AMY: I don't know. It's just.

**[Rory's home]**

(Rory is cleaning his teeth and talking on the phone at the same time.)  
RORY: Hello!  
AMY [OC]: Do you feel like you've forgotten something really important?

**[Amy's bedroom]**

AMY: Do you feel like there's a great big thing in your head, and you feel
like you should remember it, but you can't?

**[Rory's home]**

RORY: Yep.

**[Amy's bedroom]**

AMY: Are you just saying yes because you're scared of me?  
RORY [OC]: Yep.  
AMY: I love you.  
RORY [OC]: Yep.

**[Rory's home]**

RORY: Er, I mean, I love you too!

**[Wedding reception]**

MASTER OF CEREMONIES: Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, the father
of the bride, Augustus Pond!  
AUGUSTUS: Sorry, everyone. I'll be another two minutes. I'm just reviewing
certain aspects.  
TABETHA: Your father, Amelia, will be the absolute death of me. Unless, of
course, I strike pre-emptively.  
(Amy sees River walking past the windows. She stands up.)  
RORY: Amy? You okay?  
AMY: Yeah, I'm fine.  
RORY: Right. Er, you're crying.  
AMY: So I am. Why am I doing that?  
RORY: Because you're happy, probably. Happy Mrs Rory. Happy, happy, happy.  
AMY: No, I'm sad. I'm really, really sad.  
RORY: Great.  
AMY: Why am I sad? What's that?  
RORY: Oh, er, someone left it for you. A woman.  
AMY: But what is it?  
RORY: It's a book.  
(It's a book with a Tardis design cover.)  
AMY: It's blank.  
RORY: It's a present.  
AMY: But why?  
RORY: Well, you know the old saying. The old wedding thing. Huh? Amy, what?
Hey.  
AUGUSTUS: Ready now. Sorry about that. Last minute adjustments to certain
aspects. Now then, it hardly seems a year since  
(Amy sees one of the guests wearing a bow tie, and another with braces. A tear
falls onto the book.)  
AUGUSTUS: At the age of six and announced that the new head teacher wasn't
real because she looked like a cartoon.  
AMY: Shut up, Dad!  
RORY: Amy?  
AUGUSTUS: Amelia?  
AMY: Sorry, but shut up, please. There's someone missing. Someone important.
Someone so, so important.  
RORY: Amy, what's wrong?  
AMY: Sorry. Sorry, everyone. But when I was a kid, I had an imaginary friend.  
TABETHA: Oh no, not this again.  
AMY: The raggedy Doctor. My raggedy Doctor. But he wasn't imaginary, he was
real.  
TABETHA: The psychiatrists we sent her to.  
AMY: I remember you. I remember! I brought the others back, I can bring you
home, too. Raggedy man, I remember you, and you are late for my wedding!  
(The glasses start rattling, very gently.)  
AMY: I found you. I found you in words, like you knew I would. That's why you
told me the story the brand new, ancient blue box.  
(A strong wind blows the balloons around.)  
AMY: Oh, clever. Very clever.  
RORY: Amy, what is it?  
AMY: Something old. Something new. Something borrowed. Something blue.  
(The Tardis materialises in the middle of the room.)  
RORY: It's the Doctor. How did we forget the Doctor? I was plastic. He was the
stripper at my stag. Long story.  
(Amy knocks on the Tardis door.)  
AMY: Okay, Doctor. Did I surprise you this time?  
(The Doctor appears in top hat and tails.)  
DOCTOR: Er, yeah. Completely astonished. Never expected that. How lucky I
happened to be wearing this old thing. Hello, everyone. I'm Amy's imaginary
friend. But I came anyway.  
AMY: You absolutely, definitely may kiss the bride.  
DOCTOR: Amelia, from now on I shall be leaving the kissing duties to the brand
new Mister Pond.  
RORY: No, I'm not Mister Pond. That's not how it works.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, it is.  
RORY: Yeah, it is.  
DOCTOR: Right then, everyone. I'll move my box. You're going to need the
space. I only came for the dancing.  
(Later, in the disco phase of the party, the Doctor is moving to the rhythm of
Crazy Little Thing Called Love by Queen.)  
AMY: You're terrible. That is embarrassing!  
DOCTOR: That's it. That's good. Keep it loose.  
(The little children love him. And later, when the tempo is slowed for the
smooch tunes like You Give Me Something" by James Morrison, the Doctor watches
Amy and Rory.)  
DOCTOR: Two thousand years. The boy who waited. Good on you, mate.

**[Outside Amy's house]**

(Which is where he parked the Tardis.)  
RIVER: Did you dance? Well, you always dance at weddings, don't you?  
DOCTOR: You tell me.  
RIVER: Spoilers.  
(The Doctor returns the book and vortex manipulator to River.)  
DOCTOR: The writing's all back, but I didn't peek.  
RIVER: Thank you.  
DOCTOR: Are you married, River?  
RIVER: Are you asking?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
RIVER: Yes.  
DOCTOR: No, hang on. Did you think I was asking you to marry me, or or or
asking if you were married?  
RIVER: Yes.  
DOCTOR: No, but was that yes, or yes?  
RIVER: Yes.  
DOCTOR: River, who are you?  
RIVER: You're going to find out very soon now. And I'm sorry, but that's when
everything changes.  
(River vanishes.)  
DOCTOR: Nah.

**[Tardis]**

AMY: Oi! Where are you off to? We haven't even had a snog in the shrubbery
yet.  
RORY: Amy!  
AMY: Shut up. It's my wedding.  
RORY; Our wedding.  
DOCTOR: Sorry, you two. Shouldn't have slipped away. Bit busy, you know?  
RORY; You just saved the whole of space and time? Take the evening off. Maybe
a bit of tomorrow.  
DOCTOR: Space and time isn't safe yet. The Tardis exploded for a reason.
Something drew the Tardis to this particular date, and blew it up. Why? And
why now?  
(The phone starts ringing.)  
DOCTOR: The Silence, whatever it is, is still out there, and I have to. Excuse
me a moment.  
(He answers the telephone.)  
DOCTOR: Hello? Oh, hello. I'm sorry, this is a very bad line. No, no, no, but
that's not possible. She was sealed into the seventh Obelisk. I was at the
prayer meeting. Well, no, I get that it's important. An Egyptian goddess loose
on the Orient Express, in space. Give us a mo. (to Amy and Rory) Sorry,
something's come up. This will have to be goodbye.  
AMY: Yeah, I think it's goodbye. Do you think it's goodbye?  
RORY: Definitely goodbye.  
(Amy goes to the door and shouts to Leadworth.)  
AMY: Goodbye! Goodbye.  
DOCTOR: Don't worry about a thing, your Majesty. We're on our way.
