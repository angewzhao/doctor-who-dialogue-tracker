**The Day of the Doctor**  
  
Original Airdate: 23 Nov, 2013  

_[Online Prequel - The Last Day by Stephen Moffat]  
  
(We are seeing a Gallifreyan soldier from someone else's viewpoint.)  
SOLDIER: Don't try to speak. If you can hear me, nod. When the headcam's
attached for the first time, your speech centres get a bit confused. You'll be
fine in a bit. Do you want to try standing? Oh, that's it. It'll feel better
any second. What I'm doing now is fusing the grid to your neural receptors.
From now on, the headcam is downloading directly into your memory. A tiny part
of your brain is now a hard drive. Takes up hardly any space. You won't feel a
thing. Now, at the beginning, sometimes this has side-effects. (flash of a
screaming soldier) I don't know what the guys have been telling you, but trust
me, they're not premonitions, okay? Just side-effects, hallucinations. Okay,
take a look in the mirror. I'm going to show you how the fittings work.  
(Our soldier turns, sees himself and staggers back, falling over.)  
SOLDIER: It's only an hallucination. It's okay, it's not real, it's not a
premonition. Are you listening to me?  
(A little later, the soldier puts on his helmet.)  
SOLDIER: Okay, this is the official stuff. In the event of your death, your
headcam memories will be stripped from your cerebral cortex and uploaded to
your family drives. Anything gruesome or unsuitable for children, like
actually dying for instance, will be tinted red. There's a language filter,
which will cut any time you say....  
(Out onto the battlements.)  
SOLDIER: Hedigar, this is the new guy. Don't scare him.  
HEDIGAR: Do you know why you're safe up here?  
SOLDIER: Don't do the speech.  
HEDIGAR: You said don't scare him.  
SOLDIER: The speech is what scares people.  
HEDIGAR: Almost nothing in the universe can get through a sky trench. Nothing
in history's ever gotten through two. Up there, we've got four hundred of
them.  
SOLDIER: Welcome to Arcadia.  
HEDIGAR: Safest place on Gallifrey.  
(Static - later.)  
SOLDIER: Okay, you take that one, I'll take this one.  
(Looking into a screen, observing the skies.)  
SOLDIER: He was right. Nothing can get past a sky trench. But if just one
Dalek made it through, it could destroy this entire city. That's all it would
take. One Dalek. One Dalek acting alone and we're finished. So you scan
everything, clear? Everything you see, you scan it. See that little speck over
there, a bird or something? Pretend its a Dalek. Zoom right in on that. All
the way in. Use the vision stabilisers, turn up the enhancers to 10+,
initialise the image lock.  
(It is a Dalek.)  
SOLDIER: That... that's not actually possible. Lock on to it. Lock on. That's
not an hallucination. That's real. That's real! Track it. Track it wherever it
goes.  
(Alarm sounds.)  
SOLDIER: Dalek incoming. Dalek incoming. Maximum alert.  
(And now an army of them flying in.)  
SOLDIER: Daleks incoming. Alert! Alert!  
(A Dalek fires at us, the screen turns red, a scream.)_  
  
**[Outside Coal Hill Secondary School]**

(A policeman is on his beat past the sign to I M Foreman's scrap yard at 76
Totter's Lane. Note - Chairman of the School Governors is I Chesterton.)  
CLARA [OC]: Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be
one. Marcus Aurelius.

**[Classroom]**

The end of class bell rings. A young man rushes in as the other students
leave.)  
CLARA: Have you been running?  
TOM: Are you okay? There was a call for you at the office, from your doctor.  
CLARA: Did he leave an address?  
(He hands her a piece of paper. She grabs her motorcycle gear and leaves. The
Tardis is parked on the side of a lonely country road. Clara sounds her horn
and drives straight at it. The doors open to let her in.)

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor is reading a book on Advanced Quantum Mechanics.)  
DOCTOR: Draught.  
(Clara clicks her fingers and the doors close.)  
DOCTOR: Fancy a week in ancient Mesopotamia followed by future Mars?  
CLARA: Will there be cocktails?  
DOCTOR: On the Moon.  
CLARA: The Moon'll do.  
(They laugh and embrace.)  
DOCTOR: How's the new job? Teach anything good?  
CLARA: No. Learn anything?  
DOCTOR: Not a thing.  
(They slap palms. Alert. Tardis interference detected.)  
CLARA: What's happening?  
DOCTOR: Whoa, whoa. We're taking off, but the engines aren't going.  
(Because the Tardis has been grabbed by a lifting grapple from a helicopter.)  
PILOT [OC]: Windmill Eleven to Greyhouse leader. Blue Eagle is airborne. Ready
to receive. We're on our way.

**[Outside the White Tower]**

OSGOOD: Hello? Kate Stewart's phone. Oh, hold on. Excuse me. Ma'am. Ma'am!  
KATE: The ravens are looking a bit sluggish. Tell Malcolm they need new
batteries.  
OSGOOD: It's him. Sorry, it's your personal phone, but, well, I recognised the
ring tone. It's him, isn't it?  
(She gets a bit breathless as she hand the phone over.)  
KATE: Inhaler.  
(Her assistant uses her inhaler. Notice the very long multicoloured scarf
wrapped around her neck.)  
KATE: Doctor, hello. We found the Tardis in a field. I'm having it brought in.

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor is hanging out of the door, using the external emergency
telephone.)  
DOCTOR: No kidding.  
KATE [OC]: Where are you?  
(He holds the phone up towards the helicopter as they fly up the Thames.)

**[Outside the White Tower / Tardis]**

KATE: Oh, my god! Oh, Doctor, I'm so sorry. We had no idea you were still in
there. Come on.  
PILOT [OC]: Roger. New heading two zero seven. Changing course.  
(The turn sends the Doctor out of the door. Clara manages to grab hold of his
feet.)  
KATE: Doctor, can you hear me? I don't think he can hear me.  
DOCTOR: Next time, would it kill you to knock?  
KATE: I'm having you taken directly to the scene. Doctor, hello, are you okay?  
DOCTOR: Whoa! I'm just going to pop you on hold.  
(He changes position to hang onto the base of the Tardis with his hands.)  
KATE: Doctor?  
CLARA: Doctor!  
(They fly to - )

**(Trafalgar Square]**

SOLDIER: Atten - shun!  
(The Doctor drops down before the Tardis is lowered to the ground and salutes
Kate, Osgood and the squad of UNIT soldiers waiting for him.)  
DOCTOR: Why am I saluting?  
KATE: Doctor, as Chief Scientific Officer, may I extend the official apologies
of UNIT  
DOCTOR: Kate Lethbridge Stewart, a word to the wise. As I'm sure your father
would have told you, I don't like being picked up.  
CLARA: That probably sounded better in his head.  
KATE: I'm acting on instructions direct from the throne. Sealed orders from
her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the First.  
CLARA: The Queen? The First? Sorry, Elizabeth the First?  
KATE: Her credentials are inside.  
(The Doctor is about to break the seal on the message when Kate points back to
the National Gallery.)  
KATE: No. Inside.  
DOCTOR: (to Osgood) Nice scarf.  
KATE: What's our cover story for this?  
OSGOOD: Er, Derren Brown.  
KATE: Again?  
OSGOOD: Oh, we've sent him flowers.  
(The Doctor and Kate head up the steps to the gallery.)  
SOLDIER: Atten-shun! Right, I want a secure perimeter around the gallery.

**[National Gallery]**

CLARA: Did you know her, Elizabeth the First?  
DOCTOR: Unified Intelligence Task Force.  
CLARA: Sorry?  
DOCTOR: This lot. UNIT. They investigate alien stuff. Anything alien.  
CLARA: What, like you?  
DOCTOR: I work for them.  
CLARA: You have a job?  
DOCTOR: Why shouldn't I have a job? I'd be brilliant at having a job.  
CLARA: You don't have a job.  
DOCTOR: I do. This is my job. I'm doing it now.  
CLARA You never have a job.  
DOCTOR: I do. I do.  
(A painting is unveiled of an alien Citadel on fire and under attack.)  
KATE: Elizabeth's credentials, Doctor.  
CLARA: But, but that's not possible.  
DOCTOR: No more.  
KATE: That's the title.  
DOCTOR: I know the title.  
KATE: Also known as Gallifrey Falls.  
DOCTOR: This painting doesn't belong here, not in this time or place.  
CLARA: Obviously.  
DOCTOR: It's the fall of Arcadia, Gallifrey's second city.  
CLARA: But how is it doing that? How is that possible? It's an oil painting in
3D.  
(She steps forward and we can see that she is correct.)  
DOCTOR: Time Lord art. Bigger on the inside. A slice of real time, frozen.  
KATE: Elizabeth told us where to find it, and its significance.  
(The Doctor takes Clara's hand.)  
CLARA: You okay?  
DOCTOR: He was there.  
CLARA: Who was?  
DOCTOR: Me. The other me. The one I don't talk about.  
CLARA: I don't understand.  
DOCTOR: I've had many faces, many lives. I don't admit to all of them. There's
one life I've tried very hard to forget. He was the Doctor who fought in the
Time War, and that was the day he did it. The day I did it. The day he killed
them all. The last day of the Time War. The war to end all wars between my
people and the Daleks. And in that battle there was a man with more blood on
his hands than any other, a man who would commit a crime that would silence
the universe. And that man was me.

**[Arcadia]**

(We get treated to the battle scene with fleeing civilians, buildings being
destroyed, flying Daleks and soldiers firing at them. Lots of explosions and
deaths.)  
DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate.  
SOLDIER: Message for the High Council, Priority Omega. Arcadia has fallen. I
repeat, Arcadia has fallen.  
(He sees the Type 40 Tardis with the stuck chameleon circuit, and its occupant
comes towards him. This is the John Hurt Doctor No More version.)  
WARRIOR: Soldier, I'm going to need your gun.  
(He shoots at a concrete wall.)  
DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate. Exterminate!  
GALLIFREYAN: Please. Please, just don't.  
DALEK: Alert! Alert! The Doctor is detected.  
DALEKS: The Doctor is surrounded!  
DALEK: Inform High Command we have the Doctor. Seek, locate, destroy.  
(The Gallifreyan family sneak away. The Doctor has etched No More into the
concrete wall.)  
DALEKS: Seek, locate, destroy. Seek  
(A Tardis smashes through, bashing the Daleks to pieces.  
DALEK: The Doctor is escaping. What are these words? Explain. Explain.

**[War room]**

(Inside the Citadel.)  
ANDROGAR: The High Council is in emergency session. They have plans of their
own.  
GENERAL: To hell with the High Council. Their plans have already failed.
Gallifrey's still in the line of fire. So, he was there then?  
ANDROGAR: He left a message, a written warning for the Daleks. He's a fool.  
GENERAL: No, he's a madman.  
ANDROGAR: As you can see, sir, all Dalek fleets surrounding the planet now
converging on the capital, but the Sky Trenches are holding.  
(Boom! The building shakes.)  
GENERAL: Where did he go next?  
ANDROGAR: What does it matter? This is their biggest ever attack, sir. They're
throwing everything at us  
TIME LADY: Sir, we have a security breach to the Time Vaults.  
GENERAL: The Omega Arsenal, where all the forbidden weapons are locked away.  
ANDROGAR: They're not forbidden any more. We've used them all against the
Daleks.  
GENERAL: No. No we haven't.

**[Omega Arsenal]**

(A plinth is empty.)  
GENERAL: The Moment is gone.  
ANDROGAR: I don't understand. What is the Moment? I've never heard of it.  
GENERAL: The galaxy eater. The final work of the ancients of Gallifrey. A
weapon so powerful, the operating system became sentient. According to legend,
it developed a conscience.  
ANDROGAR: And we've never used it.  
GENERAL: How do you use a weapon of ultimate mass destruction when it can
stand in judgment on you? There is only one man who would even try.

**[Desert planet]**

WARRIOR: Time Lords of Gallifrey, Daleks of Skaro, I serve notice on you all.
Too long I have stayed my hand. No more. Today you leave me no choice. Today,
this war will end. No more. No more.  
(The War Doctor, Other Doctor or Warrior as I prefer shifts the sack he is
carrying on his back and enters a lonely barn.)

**[Barn]**

(He puts down the sack and reveals a brass inlaid clockwork box.)  
WARRIOR: How, how do you work? Why is there never a big red button?  
(He hears scuffling noises, and opens the door.)  
WARRIOR: Hello? Is somebody there?  
MOMENT: It's nothing.  
(A blonde woman who looks exactly like Rose Tyler is sitting on the clockwork
box.)  
MOMENT: It's just a wolf.  
WARRIOR: Don't sit on that!  
MOMENT: Why not?  
WARRIOR: Because it's not a chair, it's the most dangerous weapon in the
universe.  
(He hurries her from the barn and closes the door behind her. And there she
is, sitting on the box.)  
MOMENT: Why can't it be both? Why did you park so far away? Didn't you want
her to see it?  
WARRIOR: Want who to see?  
MOMENT: The Tardis. You walked for miles, and miles and miles and miles and
miles.  
WARRIOR: I was thinking  
MOMENT: I heard you.  
WARRIOR: You heard me?  
MOMENT: No more. No more.  
WARRIOR: No more.  
MOMENT: No more. No more.  
WARRIOR: Stop it.  
MOMENT: No more.  
WARRIOR: Who are you?  
(The clockwork in the box makes a noise.)  
WARRIOR: It's activating. Get out of here.  
(He tries to take hold of the box.)  
WARRIOR: Ow!  
MOMENT: What's wrong?  
WARRIOR: The interface is hot.  
MOMENT: Well, I do my best.  
WARRIOR: There's a power source inside. (penny drops) You're the interface?  
MOMENT: They must have told you the Moment had a conscience. Hello! Oh, look
at you. Stuck between a girl and a box. Story of your life, eh, Doctor?  
WARRIOR: You know me?  
MOMENT: I hear you. All of you, jangling around in that dusty old head of
yours. I chose this face and form especially for you. It's from your past. Or
possibly your future. I always get those two mixed up.  
WARRIOR: I don't have a future.  
MOMENT: I think I'm called Rose Tyler. No. Yes. No, sorry, no, no, in this
form, I'm called Bad Wolf. Are you afraid of the big bad wolf, Doctor?  
WARRIOR: Stop calling me Doctor.  
MOMENT: That's the name in your head.  
WARRIOR: It shouldn't be. I've been fighting this war for a long time. I've
lost the right to be the Doctor.  
MOMENT: Then you're the one to save us all.  
WARRIOR: Yes.  
MOMENT: If I ever develop an ego, you've got the job.  
WARRIOR: If you have been inside my head, then you know what I've seen. The
suffering. Every moment in time and space is burning. It must end, and I
intend to end it the only way I can.  
MOMENT: And you're going to use me to end it by killing them all, Daleks and
Time Lords alike. I could, but there will be consequences for you.  
WARRIOR: I have no desire to survive this.  
MOMENT: Then that's your punishment. If you do this, if you kill them all,
then that's the consequence. You live. Gallifrey. You're going to burn it, and
all those Daleks with it, but all those children too. How many children on
Gallifrey right now?  
WARRIOR: I don't know.  
MOMENT: One day you will count them. One terrible night. Do you want to see
what that will turn you into? Come on, aren't you curious?  
A whirling portal opens above them.)  
MOMENT: I'm opening windows on your future. A tangle in time through the days
to come, to the man today will make of you.  
(A fez drops through the portal.)  
MOMENT: Okay, I wasn't expecting that.

**[National Gallery]**

CLARA: But the Time War's over. Why have you brought us here to look at a
painting?  
KATE: The painting only serves as Elizabeth's credentials, proof that the
letter is from her. It's not why you're here.  
(The Doctor breaks the wax seal and unfolds the paper.)  
ELIZABETH [OC]: My dearest love, I hope the painting known as Gallifrey Falls
will serve as proof that it is your Elizabeth who writes to you now. You will
recall that you pledged yourself to the safety of my kingdom. In this capacity
I have appointed you as curator of the Under Gallery, where deadly danger to
England is locked away. Should any disturbance occur within its walls, it is
my wish that you be summoned. God speed, gently husband.  
DOCTOR: What happened?  
KATE: Easier to show you.  
(The Doctor and Clara leave with Kate. The man with Osgood answers his phone.)  
MCGILLOP: McGillop. But that's not possible. I was just. Understood, sir. But
why would I take it there?  
(Meanwhile, a metal shutter comes down behind the Doctor and Clara as they
stand in front of a painting on wood of Gloriana herself.)  
CLARA: Elizabeth the First. You knew her, then?  
(And next to Gloriana in the painting, in period costume, is David Tennant.)  
DOCTOR: A long time ago.

**[England, 1562]**

(The Tardis is parked in a meadow in the bend of a river. The door is opened,
and the previous Doctor gallops out on a white horse, with a red-headed lady
on the pillion.)  
DOCTOR 10: Allons-y! There you go, your Majesty, what did I tell you? Bigger
on the inside.  
ELIZABETH: The door isn't. You nearly took my head off. It's normally me who
does that.  
(Reclining on cushions near a tent flying the royal pennant.)  
ELIZABETH: Tell me, Doctor, why I'm wasting my time on you. I have wars to
plan.  
DOCTOR 10: You have a picnic to eat.  
ELIZABETH: You could help me.  
DOCTOR 10: Well, I'm helping you eat the picnic.  
ELIZABETH: But you have a stomach for war. This face has seen conflict, it's
as clear as day.  
DOCTOR 10: Oh, I've seen conflict like you wouldn't believe. But it wasn't
this face. But never mind that, your Majesty. Up on your feet. Up, up.  
ELIZABETH: How dare you? I'm the Queen of England.  
DOCTOR 10: I'm not English. Elizabeth, will you marry me?  
ELIZABETH: Oh, my dear sweet love. Of course I will.  
DOCTOR 10: Ah, gotcha!  
ELIZABETH: My love?  
DOCTOR 10: One, the real Elizabeth would never have accepted my marriage
proposal. Two, the real Elizabeth would notice when I just casually mentioned
having a different face. But then the real Elizabeth isn't a shape-shifting
alien from outer space. And  
(He holds out a clockwork gizmo.)  
DOCTOR 10: Ding.  
ELIZABETH: What's that?  
DOCTOR 10: It's a machine that goes ding. Made it myself. Lights up in the
presence of shape-shifter DNA. Ooo. Also it can microwave frozen dinners from
up to twenty feet and download comics from the future. I never know when to
stop.  
ELIZABETH: My love, I do not understand.  
DOCTOR 10: I'm not your love, and yes you do. You're a Zygon.  
ELIZABETH: A Zygon?  
DOCTOR 10: Oh, stop it. It's over. A Zygon, yes. Big red rubbery thing covered
in suckers. Surprisingly good kisser. Think the real Queen of England would
just decide to share her throne with any old handsome bloke in a tight suit,
just cos he's got amazing hair and a nice horse? Oh.  
(No more white horse. Instead, there's the Zygon.)  
DOCTOR 10: It was the horse. I'm going to be King. Run!  
ELIZABETH: What's happening?  
DOCTOR 10: We're being attacked by a shape-shifting alien from outer space,
formerly disguised as my horse.  
(They run into a ruined building.)  
ELIZABETH: What does that mean?  
DOCTOR 10: It means we're going to need a new horse.  
ELIZABETH: Where's it going?  
DOCTOR 10: I'll hold it off. You run. Your people need you.  
ELIZABETH: And I need you alive for our wedding day.  
(Elizabeth kisses him, then runs.)  
DOCTOR 10: Oh, good work, Doctor. Nice one. The Virgin Queen? So much for
history.  
(Elizabeth runs through the trees while the Doctor tries to lure the Zygon.
She screams and the Doctor comes running. His gizmo is dinging a lot.)  
DOCTOR 10: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, very clever.  
(He talks to a lop-eared rabbit.)  
DOCTOR 10: Whatever you've got planned, forget it. I'm the Doctor. I'm nine
hundred and four years old. I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the constellation
of Kasterborous. I am the Oncoming Storm, the Bringer of Darkness, and you are
basically just a rabbit, aren't you? Okay, carry on. Just a general warning.  
ELIZABETH [OC]: Doctor!  
DOCTOR 10: Elizabeth!  
(He finds her lying on the ground.)  
ELIZABETH: That thing. Explain what it is. What does it want of us?  
DOCTOR 10: That's what I'm trying to find out. Probably just your planet.  
(A second Elizabeth walks up.)  
ELIZABETH 2: Doctor. Step away from her, Doctor. That's not me. That's the
creature.  
ELIZABETH: How is that possible? She's me. Doctor, she's me!  
(The Doctor tries to use his gizmo.)  
ELIZABETH 2: I am indeed me. A compliment that cannot be extended to yourself.  
ELIZABETH: Extraordinary. The creature has captured my exact likeness. This is
exceptional.  
ELIZABETH 2: Exceptional? A Queen would call it impertinent.  
ELIZABETH: A Queen would feel compelled to admire the skill of the execution,
before arranging one.  
DOCTOR 10: It's not working.  
ELIZABETH: One might surmise that the creature would learn quickly to protect
itself from any simple means of detection.  
ELIZABETH 2: Clearly you understand the creature better than I. But then, you
have the advantage.  
(A vortex appears in the air.)  
DOCTOR 10: Back, both of you, now! That's a time fissure. A tear in the fabric
of reality. Anything could happen.  
(A red fez drops out of it.)  
DOCTOR: 10: For instance, a fez.

**[National Gallery]**

(The portrait of the 10th Doctor and Elizabeth is concealing a door.)  
KATE: This way.

**[Under Gallery]**

KATE: Welcome to the Under Gallery. This is where Elizabeth the First kept all
art deemed too dangerous for public consumption.  
(The Doctor scoops up a handful of the sand on the floor in between two rows
of statues covered with dust sheets.)  
DOCTOR: Stone dust.  
KATE: Is it important?  
DOCTOR: In twelve hundred years I've never stepped in anything that wasn't.  
(Osgood makes a noise.)  
DOCTOR: Oi, you. Are you sciency?  
OSGOOD: Oh, er, well, er, yes.  
DOCTOR: Got a name?  
OSGOOD: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Good. I've always wanted to meet someone called Yes. Now, I want this
stone dust analysed. And I want a report in triplicate, with lots of graphs
and diagrams and complicated sums on my desk, tomorrow morning, ASAP, pronto,
L O L. See? Job. Do I have a desk?  
KATE: No.  
DOCTOR: And I want a desk.  
KATE: Get a team. Analyse the stone dust. Inhaler!  
(Further into the under gallery, the Doctor spots the red fez in a display
case. He takes it out and puts it on.)  
CLARA: Someday, you could just walk past a fez.  
DOCTOR: Never gonna happen.  
(And into another room with broken glass on the floor and alien 'paintings'
along the wall.)  
SCIENTIST: As you instructed, nothing has been touched.  
KATE: This is why we called you in.  
CLARA: 3D again.  
DOCTOR: Interesting.  
CLARA: The broken glass?  
DOCTOR: No, where it's broken from. Look at the shatter pattern. The glass on
all these paintings has been broken from the inside.  
KATE: As you can see, all the paintings are landscapes. No figures of any
kind.  
DOCTOR: So?  
KATE: There used to be.  
(She hands him a pad with the original image on it.)  
CLARA: Something's got out the paintings.  
DOCTOR: Lots of somethings. Dangerous.  
KATE: This whole place has been searched. There's nothing here that shouldn't
be, and nothing's got out.  
(Enter the time fissure.)  
DOCTOR: Oh no, not now.  
CLARA: Doctor, what is it?  
DOCTOR: No, not now. I'm busy.  
KATE: Is it to do with the paintings?  
DOCTOR: No, no. This is different. I remember this. Almost remember. Oh, of
course. This is where I come in.  
(He throws the fez into the fissure.)  
DOCTOR: Geronimo!  
(And leaps into it himself.)  
CLARA: Doctor!  
KATE: Wait!

**[Woods, 1562]**

(And lands heavily.)  
DOCTOR: Oof!  
(Doctor 10 puts on the fez.)  
ELIZABETH: Who is this man?  
DOCTOR 10: That's just what I was wondering.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that is skinny. That is proper skinny. I've never seen it from the
outside. It's like a special effect. Oi!  
(He knocks the fez to the ground.)  
DOCTOR: Ha! Matchstick man.  
DOCTOR 10: You're not.  
(They both get out their sonic screwdrivers. 11's is bigger and better.)  
DOCTOR 10: Compensating.  
DOCTOR: For what?  
DOCTOR 10: Regeneration. It's a lottery.  
DOCTOR: Oh, he's cool. Isn't he cool? I'm the Doctor and I'm all cool. Oops,
I'm wearing sandshoes.  
DOCTOR 10: What are you doing here? I'm busy.  
DOCTOR: Oh, busy. I see. Is that what we're calling it, eh? Eh?  
(He puts on his fez and turns to the two Elizabeths.)  
DOCTOR: Hello, ladies.  
DOCTOR 10: Don't start.  
DOCTOR: Listen, what you get up to in the privacy of your own regeneration is
your business.  
DOCTOR 10: One of them is a Zygon.  
DOCTOR: Urgh. I'm not judging you.  
(The time fissure reappears. They both put on their glasses, then notice each
other.)  
BOTH: Oh, lovely.  
DOCTOR: Your Majesties. Probably a good time to run.  
ELIZABETHS: But what about the creature?  
DOCTOR 10: Elizabeth, whichever one of you is the real one, turn and run in
the opposite direction to the other one.  
ELIZABETHS: Of course, my love.  
ELIZABETH: Stay alive, my love. I am not done with you yet.  
(She kisses Doctor 10 and leaves.)  
DOCTOR 10: Thanks. Lovely.  
ELIZABETH 2: I understand. Live for me, my darling. We shall be together
again.  
(Another kiss and run.)  
DOCTOR 10: Well, won't that be nice?  
DOCTOR: One of those was a Zygon.  
DOCTOR 10: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: Big red rubbery thing covered in suckers.  
DOCTOR 10: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: Venom sacs in the tongue.  
DOCTOR 10: Yeah, I'm getting the point, thank you.  
DOCTOR: Nice.  
CLARA [OC]: Doctor, is that you?  
DOCTOR: Ah, hello, Clara. Can you hear me?

**[Under Gallery / Woods]**

CLARA: Yeah, it's me. We can hear you. Where are you?  
DOCTOR: Where are we?  
DOCTOR 10: England, 1562.  
CLARA: Who are you talking to?  
DOCTORS: Myself.  
KATE: Can you come back through?  
DOCTOR: Physical passage may not be possible in both directions. Its. Ah! Hang
on. Fez incoming!  
CLARA: Nothing here.  
DOCTOR 10: So where did it go?

**[Barn]**

CLARA [OC]: Who's he talking to?  
KATE [OC]: He said himself.

**[Under Gallery]**

KATE: Keep him talking.  
(She uses her mobile as she leaves.)  
KATE: Malcolm? Malcolm, I need you to send me one of my father's incident
files. Codenamed Cromer. 70s or 80s depending on the dating protocol.  
(Something growls as it watches her go.)

**[Woods, 1562]**

DOCTOR 10: Okay, you used to be me, you've done all this before. What happens
next?  
DOCTOR: I don't remember.  
DOCTOR 10: How can you forget this?  
DOCTOR: Hey, hang on. It's not my fault. You're obviously not paying enough
attention. Reverse the polarity!  
(They both aim their sonic screwdrivers at the fissure.)  
DOCTOR: It's not working.  
DOCTOR 10: We're both reversing the polarity.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know that.  
DOCTOR 10: There's two of us. I'm reversing it, you're reversing it back
again. We're confusing the polarity.  
(The Warrior drops through the time fissure.)  
WARRIOR: Anyone lose a fez?  
DOCTOR 10: You. How can you be here? More to the point, why are you here?  
WARRIOR: Good afternoon. I'm looking for the Doctor.  
DOCTOR 10: Well, you've certainly come to the right place.  
WARRIOR: Good. Right. Well, who are you boys? Oh, of course. Are you his
companions?  
DOCTOR: His companions?  
WARRIOR: They get younger all the time. Well, if you could point me in the
general direction of the Doctor?  
(They both demonstrate their sonic screwdrivers.)  
WARRIOR: Really?  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
DOCTOR 10: Really.  
WARRIOR: You're me? Both of you?  
DOCTOR 10: Yep.  
WARRIOR: Even that one?  
DOCTOR: Yes!  
WARRIOR: You're my future selves?  
BOTH: Yes!  
WARRIOR: Am I having a midlife crisis? Why are you pointing your screwdrivers
like that? They're scientific instruments, not water pistols. Look like you've
seen a ghost.  
DOCTOR 10: Still, loving the posh gravelly thing. It's very convincing.  
DOCTOR: Brave words, Dick van Dyke.  
(A troop of soldiers run up, lead by a nobleman.)  
BENTHAM: Encircle them. Which of you is the Doctor? The Queen of England is
bewitched. I would have the Doctor's head.  
WARRIOR: Well, this has all the makings of your lucky day.

**[Under Gallery]**

(Kate returns.)  
CLARA: I think there's three of them now.

**[Woods, 1562]**

KATE [OC]: There's a precedent for that.  
BENTHAM: What is that?  
WARRIOR: Oh, the pointing again. They're screwdrivers! What are you going to
do, assemble a cabinet at them?  
BENTHAM: That thing, what witchcraft is it?  
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. Now that you mention it, that is witchcraft. Yes, yes, yes.
Witchy witchcraft. Hello? Hello in there. Excuse me. Hello!

**[Under Gallery]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Am I talking to the wicked witch of the well?  
KATE: He means you.  
CLARA: Why am I the witch?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Clara?  
CLARA: Hello?

**[Woods, 1562 / Under Gallery]**

DOCTOR: Clara, hi, hello. Hello. Would you mind telling these prattling
mortals to get themselves begone?  
CLARA: What he said.  
DOCTOR: Yes, tiny bit more colour.  
CLARA: Right. Prattling mortals, off you pop, or I'll turn you all into frogs.  
DOCTOR: Ooo, frogs. Nice. You heard her.  
CLARA: Doctor, what's going on?

**[Woods, 1562]**

DOCTOR: It's a timey-wimey thing.  
WARRIOR: Timey what? Timey-wimey?  
DOCTOR 10: I've no idea where he picks that stuff up.  
(Enter an Elizabeth. The soldiers fall to their knee.)  
SOLDIERS: The Queen. The Queen.  
ELIZABETH: You don't seem to be kneeling. How tremendously brave of you.  
DOCTOR 10: Which one are you? What happened to the other one?  
ELIZABETH: Indisposed. Long live the Queen.  
SOLDIERS: Long live the Queen.  
ELIZABETH: Arrest these men. Take them to the Tower.  
DOCTOR 10: That is not the Queen of England, that's an alien duplicate.  
DOCTOR: And you can take it from him, cos he's really checked.  
DOCTOR 10: Oh, shut up.  
DOCTOR: Venom sacs in the tongue.  
DOCTOR 10: Seriously, stop it.  
DOCTOR: No, hang on. The Tower.

**[Under Gallery]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Did you say the Tower? Ah, yes, brilliant. Love the Tower.

**[Woods, 1562]**

DOCTOR: Breakfast at eight, please. Will there be Wi-Fi?  
WARRIOR: Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about?  
DOCTOR: Yes. No. I demand to be incarcerated in the Tower immediately with my
co-conspirators Sandshoes and Granddad.  
WARRIOR: Granddad?  
DOCTOR 10: They're not sandshoes.  
WARRIOR: Yes, they are.  
ELIZABETH: Silence. The Tower is not to be taken lightly.

**[Under Gallery]**

ELIZABETH [OC]: Very few emerge again.  
KATE: Dear God, that man's clever. Come on.  
CLARA: Where are we going?  
KATE: My office, otherwise known as the Tower of London.

**[Tower dungeons]**

WARDER: Come on, you lot, get in there.  
WARRIOR: Ow.  
(The warder leaves, shutting the door behind him. The Doctor finds a piece of
metal bar and starts scratching on a stone pillar.)  
DOCTOR: Three of us in one cell? That's going to cause some nasty anomalies if
we don't get out soon.  
DOCTOR 10: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Getting us out.  
(The Warrior is using his sonic screwdriver on the wooden door.)  
DOCTOR 10: The sonic won't work on that, it's too primitive.  
DOCTOR: Shall we ask for a better quality of door so we can escape?  
DOCTOR 10: Okay, so the Queen of England is now a Zygon. But never mind that.
Why are we all together? Why are we all here? Well, me and Chinny, we were
surprised, but you came looking for us. You knew it was going to happen. Who
told you?  
(Moment Rose is holding a finger to her lips.)  
DOCTOR: Oi, Chinny?  
DOCTOR 10: Yeah, you do have a chin.

**[Under Gallery]**

(The stone dust is being analysed.)  
OSGOOD: Marble, granite. A lot of different stone, but none of it from the
fabric of the building. It's like somebody smashed up a lot of old statues.
Are there any missing?  
MCGILLOP: Don't think so. Why would anyone do that, anyway? I mean, I know
we're meant to keep an open mind, but are we supposed to believe in creatures
that can hide in oil paintings and have some sort of a grudge against statues?
You all right?  
(Osgood uses her inhaler.)  
OSGOOD: We have to go, right now, this minute.  
MCGILLOP: What's wrong?  
OSGOOD: The things from the paintings. I know why they smashed the statues.  
MCGILLOP: Why?  
OSGOOD: Because they needed somewhere to hide.  
(The nearby statues raise their dust sheets. Zygons! They attack McGillop
first, and Osgood runs.)

**[National Gallery]**

(Osgood gets into the National Gallery and shuts the door, but a Zygon smashes
through the painting of Elizabeth and the tenth Doctor. She gets into the open
lift but it will not move, so she slumps in the far corner.)  
OSGOOD: The Doctor will save me. The Doctor will save me. The Doctor will save
me. The Doctor will save me. The Doctor will save me.  
(The Zygon transforms.)  
OSGOOD-Z: Excuse me. I'm going to need my inhaler. I so hate it when I get one
with a defect. Ooo, you've got some perfectly horrible memories in here,
haven't you? So jealous of your pretty sister. I don't blame you. I wish I'd
copied her.  
OSGOOD: So do I!  
(The Zygon is standing on the end of Osgood's scarf, so she gives it a sharp
tug and down goes her duplicate, allowing her to escape.)  
OSGOOD-Z: Oh, for goodness sake.

**[Tower environs]**

KATE: The Doctor will be trying to send us a message. We're looking for a
string of numerals from around 1550, approximately. Priority One. I'm going to
need access to the Black Archive.

**[Black Archive corridor]**

KATE: The Black Archive. Highest security rating on the planet. The entire
staff have their memories wiped at the end of every shift. Automated memory
filters in the ceiling. Access, please.  
ATKINS: Ma'am.  
(Kate hands him her key.)  
KATE: Atkins, isn't it?  
ATKINS: Yes, ma'am. First day here.  
KATE: (sotto) Been here ten years.

**[Black Archive]**

CLARA: Lock and key? Bit basic, isn't it?  
KATE: Can't afford electronic security down here. Got to keep the Doctor out.
The whole of the Tower is Tardis-proofed. He really wouldn't approve of the
collection.  
CLARA: But you let me in.  
KATE: You have a top level security rating from your last visit.  
CLARA: Sorry, my what?  
KATE: Apologies. We have to screen all his known associates. We can't have
information about the Doctor and the Tardis falling into the wrong hands. The
consequences could be disastrous.  
CLARA: What is that?  
KATE: Time travel. A vortex manipulator bequeathed to the UNIT archive by
Captain Jack Harkness on the occasion of his death. Well, one of them. No one
can know we have this, not even our allies.  
CLARA: Why not?  
KATE: Think about it. Americans with the ability to rewrite history? You've
seen their movies.  
CLARA: Okay, so this is how we're going to rescue the Doctor.  
KATE: I'm not sure there's enough power for a two-way trip. In any event, we
don't have the activation code. The Doctor knows we have this, so he's always
kept the code from us. Let's hope he changes his mind.  
(Her phone rings.)  
KATE: Yes? Well, if you've found it, photograph it and send it to my phone.  
(Clara spots Osgood and McGillop.)  
CLARA: Er, Kate? Should they be here? Why have they followed us?  
KATE: Oh, they've probably just finished disposing of the humans a bit early.  
CLARA: The humans?  
KATE: Dear me. I really do get into character, don't I?  
(Kate spits some venom at Clara, then transforms into a Zygon.)  
OSGOOD-Z: The Under Gallery is secured.  
(The numbers on the photograph on Kate's phone include 231163. Clara grabs the
vortex manipulator, puts it on and copies them into it.)  
ZYGON: Prepare to dispose of one more human. We have acquired the device.  
CLARA: Activation code, right?  
(She disappears.)

**[Tower dungeon]**

(The Doctor is still scratching his message.)  
WARRIOR: In theory, I can trigger an isolated sonic shift among the molecules,
and the door should disintegrate.  
DOCTOR 10: We'd have to calculate the exact harmonic resonance of the entire
structure down to a sub-atomic level. Even the sonic would take years.  
WARRIOR: No, no, the sonic would take centuries. Oh, we might as well get
started. Help to pass the timey-wimey. Do you have to talk like children? What
is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown up? Oh, the way you both look
at me. What is that? I'm trying to think of a better word than dread.  
DOCTOR 10: It must be really recent for you.  
WARRIOR: Recent?  
DOCTOR: The Time War. The last day. The day you killed them all.  
DOCTOR 10: The day we killed them all.  
DOCTOR: Same thing.  
MOMENT: It's history for them. All decided. They think their future is real.
They don't know it's still up to you.  
WARRIOR: I don't talk about it.  
DOCTOR 10: You're not talking about it. There's no one else here.  
MOMENT: Go on, ask them. Ask them what you need to know.  
WARRIOR: Did you ever count?  
DOCTOR: Count what?  
WARRIOR: How many children there were on Gallifrey that day.  
(The Doctor stops his scratching.)  
DOCTOR: I have absolutely no idea.  
WARRIOR: How old are you now?  
DOCTOR: Ah, I don't know. I lose track. Twelve hundred and something, I think,
unless I'm lying. I can't remember if I'm lying about my age, that's how old I
am.  
WARRIOR: Four hundred years older than me, and in all that time you've never
even wondered how many there were? You never once counted?  
DOCTOR: Tell me, what would be the point?  
DOCTOR 10: Two point four seven billion.  
WARRIOR: You did count!  
DOCTOR 10: You forgot? Four hundred years, is that all it takes?  
DOCTOR: I moved on.  
DOCTOR 10: Where? Where can you be now that you can forget something like
that?  
DOCTOR: Spoilers.  
DOCTOR 10: No. No, no, no. For once I would like to know where I'm going.  
DOCTOR: No, you really wouldn't.  
WARRIOR: I don't know who you are, either of you. I haven't got the faintest
idea.  
MOMENT: They're you. They're what you become if you destroy Gallifrey. The man
who regrets and the man who forgets. The moment is coming. The Moment is me.
You have to decide.  
WARRIOR: No.  
DOCTOR 10: No?  
WARRIOR: Just, no.  
(The Doctor laughs.)  
DOCTOR 10: Is something funny? Did I miss a funny thing?  
DOCTOR: Sorry. It just occured to me. This is what I'm like when I'm alone.  
MOMENT: It's the same screwdriver. Same software, different case.  
WARRIOR: Four hundred years.  
DOCTOR 10: I'm sorry?  
WARRIOR: At a software level, they're all the same device, aren't they. Same
software, different case.  
DOCTOR 10: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: So.  
WARRIOR: So, it would take centuries for the screwdriver to calculate how to
disintegrate the door. Scanning the door, implanting the calculation as a
permanent subroutine in the software architecture and, if you really are me,
with your sandshoes and your dickie bow, and that screwdriver is still mine,
that calculation is still going on.  
DOCTOR 10: Yeah, still going.  
DOCTOR: Calculation complete.  
MOMENT: Same software, different face.  
DOCTOR: Hey, four hundred years in four seconds. We may have had our
differences, which is frankly odd in the circumstances, but, I tell you what,
boys. We are incredibly clever.  
(Clara opens the door and nearly falls in.)  
DOCTOR: How did you do that?  
CLARA: It wasn't locked.  
DOCTOR: Right.  
CLARA: So they're both you, then, yeah?  
DOCTOR: Yes. You've met them before. Don't you remember?  
CLARA: A bit. Nice suit.  
DOCTOR 10: Thanks.  
CLARA: Hang on. Three of you in one cell, and none of you thought to try the
door?  
WARRIOR: It should have been locked.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Exactly. Why wasn't it locked?  
ELIZABETH: Because I was fascinated to see what you would do upon escaping. I
understand you're rather fond of this world. It's time I think you saw what's
going to happen to it.

**[Under Gallery]**

(The real Osgood hears moaning from beneath a dust sheet, and notices a shoe
sticking out from underneath. She pulls it off to reveal another sheet of red
suckers covering a human.)  
OSGOOD: Kate? Oh goodness, you're not actually dead. Oh, that's tremendous
news. Those creatures, they turn themselves into copies. And they need to keep
the original alive, refresh the image so to speak.  
KATE: Where, where did they go?  
OSGOOD: I don't know. Oh, hang on, yes, I do. The Tower.  
KATE: If those creatures have got access to the Black Archive, we may just
have lost control of the planet.

**[Zygon control centre]**

(Another part of the Tower dungeons.)  
ELIZABETH: The Zygons lost their own world. It burnt in the first days of the
Time War. A new home is required.  
CLARA: So they want this one.  
ELIZABETH: Not yet. It's far too primitive. Zygons are used to a certain level
of comfort.  
ZYGON: Commander, why are these creatures here?  
ELIZABETH: Because I say they should be. It is time you too were translated.
Observe this. I believe you will find it fascinating.  
(The Zygon puts his hand on a glass cube with dents in the corners, then
vanishes. The 3D landscape painting from the Under Gallery is nearby.)  
CLARA: That's him! That's the Zygon in the picture now.  
WARRIOR: It's not a picture, it's a stasis cube. Time Lord art. Frozen
instants in time, bigger on the inside, but could be deployed as  
DOCTOR 10: Suspended animation. Oh, that's very good. The Zygons all pop
inside the pictures, wait a few centuries till the planet's a bit more
interesting, and then out they come.  
DOCTOR: You see, Clara, they're stored in the paintings in the Under Gallery,
like cup-a-soups. Except you add time, if you can picture that. Nobody could
picture that. Forget I said cup-a-soups.  
CLARA: And now the world is worth conquering. So the Zygons are invading the
future from the past.  
DOCTOR: Exactly.  
DOCTOR 10: And do you know why I know that you're a fake? Because you're such
a bad copy. It's not just the smell, or the unconvincing hair, or the
atrocious teeth, or the eyes just a bit too close together, or the breath that
could stun a horse. It's because my Elizabeth, the real Elizabeth, would never
be stupid enough to reveal her own plan. Honestly, why would you do that?  
ELIZABETH: Because it's not my plan. And I am the real Elizabeth.  
DOCTOR 10: Okay. So, backtracking a moment just to lend context to my earlier
remarks.  
ELIZABETH: My twin is dead in the forest. I am accustomed to taking
precautions.  
(She produces a dagger from the garter beneath her skirts.)  
ELIZABETH: These Zygon creatures never even considered that it was me who
survived rather than their own commander. The arrogance that typifies their
kind.  
CLARA: Zygons?  
ELIZABETH: Men.  
CLARA: And you actually killed one of them?  
ELIZABETH: I may have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but at the time, so
did the Zygon. The future of my kingdom is imperilled. Doctor, can I rely on
your service?  
DOCTOR 10: Well, I'm going to need my Tardis.  
ELIZABETH: It has been procured already.  
DOCTOR 10: Ah.  
ELIZABETH: But first, my love, you have a promise to keep.

**[Castle courtyard]**

CLERGYMAN: I now pronounce you man and wife.  
CLARA: Woo hoo!  
CLERGYMAN: You may kiss the bride.  
(Elizabeth does the enthusiastic kissing.)  
WARRIOR: Is there a lot of this in the future?  
DOCTOR: It does start to happen, yeah.  
ELIZABETH: God speed, my love.  
DOCTOR 10: I will be right back.  
(He runs into the Tardis and starts cranking her up.)  
DOCTOR: Right then, back to the future.

**[Tardis]**

WARRIOR: You've let this place go a bit.  
DOCTOR: Ah, it's his grunge phase. He grows out of it.  
DOCTOR 10: Don't you listen to them.  
(An alarm sounds. The tenth Doctor gets an electric shock.)  
DOCTOR 10: Ow! The desktop is glitching.  
WARRIOR: Three of us from different time zones. It's trying to compensate.  
DOCTOR: Hey, look. The round things.  
DOCTOR 10: I love the round things.  
DOCTOR: What are the round things?  
DOCTOR 10: No idea.  
DOCTOR: Oh dear, the friction contrafibulator. Ha! There, stabilised.  
(The desktop changes again.)  
DOCTOR 10: (channelling Doctor 2) Oh, you've redecorated. I don't like it.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh yeah? Oh, you never do. Listen, we're going to the National
Gallery. The Zygons are underneath it.  
CLARA: No, UNIT HQ. They followed us there in the Black Archive.  
(She gets three stares.)  
CLARA: Okay, so you've heard of that, then.

**[Black Archive]**

MCGILLOP-Z: The equipment here is phenomenal. The humans don't realise what
half this stuff does. We could conquer their world in a day.  
ZYGON: We were fortunate, then, in our choice of duplicate.  
MCGILLOP-Z: If I were human, I'd say it was Christmas.  
(Humans Kate and Osgood enter.)  
KATE: No, I'm afraid you wouldn't. We're not armed. You may relax.  
ZYGON: We are armed. You may not.  
KATE: Lock the door. I'm afraid we can't be interrupted. You don't mind if I
get comfortable?  
ZYGON: You don't mind if I do?  
(The Zygon transforms into Kate, and sits down opposite her at the table.)  
KATE: You'll realise there are protocols protecting this place. Osgood?  
OSGOOD: In the event of any alien incursion, the contents of this room are
deemed so dangerous, it will self-destruct in  
KATE: Five minutes.  
(The alarm sounds and the countdown starts.)  
KATE: There's a nuclear warhead twenty feet beneath us. Are you sitting
comfortably?  
KATE-Z: You would destroy London?  
KATE: To save the world, yes, I would.  
KATE-Z: You're bluffing.  
KATE: You really think so? Somewhere in your memory is a man called Brigadier
Alistair Gordon Lethbridge Stewart. I am his daughter.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Science leads, Kate. Is that what you meant? Is that what your
father meant?  
KATE: Doctor?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Space-Time Telegraph, Kate. A gift from me to your father,
hotline straight to the Tardis.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: I know about the Black Archive and I know about the security protocol.
Kate, please. Please tell me you are not about to do something unbelievably
stupid.  
KATE [OC]: I'm sorry, Doctor. Switch it off.  
DOCTOR 10: Not as sorry as you will be. This is not a decision you will ever
be able to live with.  
DOCTOR: Kate, we're trying to bring the Tardis in. Why can't we land?  
KATE [OC]: I said, switch it off.  
DOCTOR: No, Kate, please. Just listen to me!  
DOCTOR 10: The Tower of London, totally Tardis-proof.  
CLARA: How can they do that?  
DOCTOR: Alien technology plus human stupidity. Trust me, it's unbeatable.  
(A stasis cube is on the console.)  
WARRIOR: We don't need to land.  
DOCTOR 10: Yeah, we do. A tiny bit. Try and keep up.  
WARRIOR: No, we don't. We don't. There is another way. Cup-a-soup. What is
cup-a-soup?

**[National Gallery]**

(Back we go to an earlier scene.)  
DOCTOR: What happened?  
KATE: Easier to show you.  
(The Doctor, Kate and Clara leave. McGillop answers his phone.)  
MCGILLOP: McGillop.

**[Tardis / National Gallery]**

DOCTOR: Take a look at your phone and confirm who you're talking to.  
MCGILLOP: But that's not possible. I was just  
DOCTOR: You were just talking to me. I know. I'm a time traveller, figure it
out. I need you to send the Gallifrey Falls painting to the Black Archive.
Understood?  
MCGILLOP: Understood, sir. But why would I take it there?

**[Black Archive]**

(2:59 and counting.)  
KATE-Z: One word from you would cancel the countdown.  
KATE: Quite so.  
KATE-Z: It's keyed to your voiceprint.  
KATE: And mine alone.  
KATE-Z: Cancel the detonation!  
KATE: Countermanded.  
KATE-Z: Cancel the detonation.  
KATE: Countermanded.  
KATE-Z: We only have to agree to live.  
KATE: Sadly, we can only agree to die.  
OSGOOD: Please, Doctor. Please save us. Please save us. Please save us.

**[Gallifrey Falls]**

(Time begins to move inside the 3D painting, which contains three extra
figures by the image of an exploding Dalek.)  
DALEK: Exterminate!  
(Three sonic screwdrivers send the unhappy pepperpot crashing out of the
painting and into -)

**[Black Archive]**

(Followed by three of the same Time Lord. The Dalek expires.)  
WARRIOR: Hello.  
DOCTOR 10: I'm the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Sorry about the Dalek.  
CLARA: Also the showing off.  
DOCTOR: Kate Lethbridge Stewart, what in the name of sanity are you doing?  
KATE: The countdown can only be halted at my personal command. There's nothing
you can do.  
DOCTOR 10: Except make you both agree to halt it.  
KATE: Not even three of you.  
WARRIOR: You're about to murder millions of people.  
KATE: To save billions. How many times have you made that calculation?  
(1:36)  
DOCTOR: Once. Turned me into the man I am now. I'm not even sure who that is
any more.  
DOCTOR 10: You tell yourself it's justified, but it's a lie. Because what I
did that day was wrong. Just wrong.  
(The Warrior turns to look at the Moment.)  
DOCTOR: And, because I got it wrong, I'm going to make you get it right.  
KATE: How?  
DOCTOR 10: Any second now, you're going to stop that countdown. Both of you,
together.  
DOCTOR: Then you're going to negotiate the most perfect treaty of all time.  
DOCTOR 10: Safeguards all round, completely fair on both sides.  
DOCTOR: And the key to perfect negotiation?  
DOCTOR 10: Not knowing what side you're on.  
DOCTOR: So, for the next few hours, until we decide to let you out  
DOCTOR 10: No one in this room will be able to remember if they're human  
DOCTOR: Or Zygon.  
DOCTOR: Whoops a daisy.  
(He jumps on to the table. Three screwdrivers do something to the memory
filter in the ceiling. The countdown reaches 7 as the humans look befuddled.)  
KATES: Cancel the detonation!  
(It stops at 5.)  
DOCTOR: Peace in our time.  
(As the Kates talk in the background.)  
OSGOOD-Z: It's funny, isn't it. If I'm a Zygon, then my clothes must be Zygon,
too. So, what happens if I lose a shoe or something?  
(Osgood coughs, and her duplicate returns the inhaler with a shush gesture.
Meanwhile, Clara explores the photo array of past companions, starting with
the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan. Then she goes to the Warrior, who is
sitting in the seventh Doctor's big leather chair.)  
CLARA: Hello.  
WARRIOR: Hello.  
CLARA: I'm Clara. We haven't really met yet.  
WARRIOR: I look forward to it. Is there a problem?  
CLARA: The Doctor, my, my Doctor, he's always talking about the day he did it.
The day he wiped out the Time Lords to stop the war.  
WARRIOR: One would.  
CLARA: You wouldn't. Because you haven't done it yet. It's still in your
future.  
WARRIOR: You're very sure of yourself.  
CLARA: He regrets it. I see it in his eyes every day. He'd do anything to
change it.  
WARRIOR: Including saving all these people. How many worlds has his regret
saved, do you think? Look over there. Humans and Zygons working together in
peace. How did you know?  
CLARA: Your eyes. You're so much younger.  
WARRIOR: Then, all things considered, it's time I grew up. I've seen all I
needed. The moment has come.  
(The Moment is standing nearby, watching them.)  
WARRIOR: I'm ready.  
MOMENT: I know you are.  
CLARA: Who's there? Who were you talking to?  
(The Warrior, Doctor Eight point five, has vanished.)

**[Barn]**

MOMENT: You wanted a big red button.  
(A red, rose-like button stands on a stalk above the Moment box.)  
MOMENT: One big bang, no more Time Lords. No more Daleks. Are you sure?  
WARRIOR: I was sure when I came in here. There is no other way.  
MOMENT: You've seen the men you will become.  
WARRIOR: Those men. Extraordinary.  
MOMENT: They were you.  
WARRIOR: No. They are the Doctor.  
MOMENT: You're the Doctor, too.  
WARRIOR: No. Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men
to light the flame, whatever the cost.  
(His hand hesitates over the button as he recalls the sound of children's
laughter.)  
MOMENT: You know the sound the Tardis makes? That wheezing, groaning. That
sound brings hope wherever it goes.  
WARRIOR: Yes. Yes, I like to think it does.  
MOMENT: To anyone who hears it, Doctor. Anyone, however lost.  
(The sound of the time rotor is heard.)  
MOMENT: Even you.  
(Two Tardises park themselves in the barn. Enter the Doctors and Clara.)  
CLARA: I told you. He hasn't done it yet.  
WARRIOR: Go away now, all of you. This is for me.  
DOCTOR 10: These events should be time-locked. We shouldn't even be here.  
DOCTOR: So something let us through.  
MOMENT: You clever boys.  
WARRIOR: Go back. Go back to your lives. Go and be the Doctor that I could
never be. Make it worthwhile.  
DOCTOR 10: All those years, burying you in my memory.  
DOCTOR: Pretending you didn't exist. Keeping you a secret, even from myself.  
DOCTOR 10: Pretending you weren't the Doctor, when you were the Doctor more
than anybody else.  
DOCTOR: You were the Doctor on the day it wasn't possible to get it right.  
DOCTOR 10: But this time  
DOCTOR: You don't have to do it alone.  
(They put their hands on the button together.)  
WARRIOR: Thank you.  
DOCTOR 10: What we do today is not out of fear or hatred. It is done because
there is no other way.  
DOCTOR: And it is done in the name of the many live we are failing to save.  
(He looks at Clara, who shakes her head.)  
DOCTOR: What? What is it? What?  
CLARA: Nothing.  
DOCTOR: No, it's something. Tell me.  
CLARA: You told me you wiped out your own people. I just. I never pictured you
doing it, that's all.  
MOMENT: Take a closer look.  
(It suddenly goes dark.)  
CLARA: What's happening?  
WARRIOR: Nothing. It's a projection.  
MOMENT: It's a reality around you.  
(They are seeing Gallifrey at war.)  
CLARA: These are the people you're going to burn?  
DOCTOR 10: There isn't anything we can do.  
DOCTOR: He's right. There isn't another way. There never was. Either I destroy
my own people or let the universe burn.  
CLARA: Look at you. The three of you. The warrior, the hero, and you.  
DOCTOR: And what am I?  
CLARA: Have you really forgotten?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Maybe, yes.  
CLARA: We've got enough warriors. Any old idiot can be a hero.  
DOCTOR: Then what do I do?  
CLARA: What you've always done. Be a doctor. You told me the name you chose
was a promise. What was the promise?  
(The fighting seems to have stopped on Gallifrey.)  
DOCTOR 10: Never cruel or cowardly.  
WARRIOR: Never give up, never give in.  
(The images vanish.)  
DOCTOR 10: You're not actually suggesting that we change our own personal
history?  
DOCTOR: We change history all the time. I'm suggesting far worse.  
WARRIOR: What, exactly?  
DOCTOR: Gentlemen, I have had four hundred years to think about this. I've
changed my mind.  
(He sonicks the big red button back into the Moment box.)  
WARRIOR: There's still a billion billion Daleks up there, attacking.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, there is. There is.  
DOCTOR 10: But there's something those billion billion Daleks don't know.  
DOCTOR: Because if they did, they'd probably send for reinforcements.  
CLARA: What? What don't they know?  
DOCTOR: This time, there's three of us.  
WARRIOR: Oh! Oh, yes, that is good. That is brilliant!  
DOCTOR 10: Oh, oh, oh, I'm getting that too! That is brilliant!  
DOCTOR: Ha, ha, ha! I've been thinking about it for centuries.  
WARRIOR: She didn't just show me any old future, she showed me exactly the
future I needed to see.  
MOMENT: Now you're getting it.  
DOCTOR: Eh? Who did?  
WARRIOR: Oh, Bad Wolf girl, I could kiss you.  
MOMENT: Yeah, that's going to happen.  
DOCTOR 10: Sorry, did you just say Bad Wolf?  
CLARA: So what are we doing? What's the plan?  
WARRIOR: The Dalek fleets are surrounding Gallifrey, firing on it constantly.  
DOCTOR 10: The Sky Trench is holding, but what if the whole planet just
disappeared?  
CLARA: Tiny bit of an ask.  
DOCTOR 10: The Daleks would be firing on each other. They'd destroy themselves
in their own crossfire.  
WARRIOR: Gallifrey would be gone, the Daleks would be destroyed, and it would
look to the rest of the universe as if they'd annihilated each other.  
CLARA: But where would Gallifrey be?  
DOCTOR 10: Frozen. Frozen in an instant of time, safe and hidden away.  
DOCTOR: Exactly.  
WARRIOR: Like a painting.

**[War room]**

ANDROGAR: Another one.  
GENERAL: Are you sure the message is from him?  
ANDROGAR: Oh, yes.  
GENERAL: Why would he do that?  
(The message reads - Gallifrey Stands.)  
GENERAL: What's the mad fool talking about now?  
(Holo-monitors appear as the Doctors introduce themselves.)  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Hello, hello, Gallifrey High Command, this is the Doctor
speaking.  
DOCTOR 10 [on monitor]: Hello! Also the Doctor. Can you hear me?  
WARRIOR [on monitor]: Also the Doctor, standing ready.  
GENERAL: Dear God, three of them. All my worst nightmares at once.  
DOCTOR 10 [on monitor]: General, we have a plan.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: We should point at this moment, it is a fairly terrible plan

**[War room]**

DOCTOR 10 [on monitor]: And almost certainly won't work.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: I was happy with fairly terrible.  
DOCTOR 10 [on monitor]: Sorry, just thinking out loud.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: We're flying our three Tardises into your lower atmosphere.

**[Tardis 10]**

DOCTOR 10: We're positioned at equidistant intervals around the globe.
Equidistant. So grown up.

**[Tardis 8.5]**

WARRIOR: We're just about ready to do it.  
GENERAL [OC]: Ready to do what?

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: We're going to freeze Gallifrey.

**[War room]**

GENERAL: I'm sorry, what?

**[Tardis 10]**

DOCTOR 10: Using our Tardises, we're going to freeze Gallifrey in a single
moment in time.

**[War room]**

WARRIOR [on monitor]: You know, like those stasis cubes? A single moment in
time, held in a parallel pocket universe.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Except we're going to do it to a whole planet.

**[Tardis 10]**

DOCTOR 10: And all the people on it.

**[War room]**

GENERAL: What? Even if that were possible

**[Tardis]**

GENERAL [OC]: Which it isn't, why would you do such a thing?  
DOCTOR: Because the alternative is burning.

**[Tardis 10]**

DOCTOR 10: And I've seen that.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: And I never want to see it again.

**[War room]**

GENERAL: We'd be lost in another universe, frozen in a single moment. We'd
have nothing.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: You would have hope. And right now, that is exactly what you don't
have.

**[War room]**

GENERAL: It's delusional. The calculations alone would take hundreds of years.

**[Tardises]**

(Each Tardis has a stasis cube on the console.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, hundreds and hundreds.  
DOCTOR 10: But don't worry, I started a very long time ago.  
DOCTOR 1: Calling the War Council of Gallifrey. This is the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: You might say I've been doing this all my lives.

**[War room]**

DOCTOR 2 [on monitor]: Good luck.  
DOCTOR 3 [on monitor]: Standing by.  
DOCTOR 4 [on monitor]: Ready.  
DOCTOR 8 [on monitor]: Commencing calculations.  
DOCTOR 5 [on monitor]: Soon be there.  
DOCTOR 7 [on monitor]: Across the boundaries that divide one universe from
another.  
DOCTOR 6 [on monitor]: Just got to lock on to his coordinates.

**[Tardis 9]**

DOCTOR 9: And for my next trick.

**[War room]**

GENERAL: I didn't know when I was well off. All twelve of them!  
ANDROGAR: No, sir. All thirteen!  
(A new pair of grey eyebrows is seen.)  
ANDROGAR: Sir! The Daleks know that something is happening. They're increasing
their fire power.  
GENERAL: Do it, Doctor. Just do it.

**[Tardises]**

GENERAL [OC]: Just do it.  
DOCTOR: Okay. Gentlemen, we're ready. Geronimo!  
DOCTOR 10: Allons-y!  
WARRIOR: Oh, for God's sake. Gallifrey stands!  
(Tardises rush towards the planet and surround it, then whiteout!)

**[National Gallery]**

(Having a cup of tea in front of Gallifrey Falls. Three Tardises are lined up
by one wall. The opposite is decorated with a collection of roundels.)  
WARRIOR: I don't suppose we'll know if we actually succeeded. But at worst, we
failed doing the right thing, as opposed to succeeding in doing the wrong.  
CLARA: Life and soul, you are.  
DOCTOR 10: What is it actually called?  
DOCTOR: Well, there's some debate. Either No More or Gallifrey Falls.  
WARRIOR: Not very encouraging.  
DOCTOR 10: How did it get here?  
DOCTOR: No idea.  
DOCTOR 10: There's always something we don't know, isn't there?  
WARRIOR: One should certainly hope so. Well, gentlemen, it has been an honour
and a privilege.  
DOCTOR 10: Likewise.  
DOCTOR: Doctor.  
WARRIOR: And if I grow to be half the man that you are, Clara Oswald, I shall
be happy indeed.  
CLARA: That's right. Aim high.  
WARRIOR: I won't remember this, will I?  
DOCTOR: The time streams are out of sync. You can't retain it, no.  
WARRIOR: So I won't remember that I tried to save Gallifrey rather than burn
it. I'll have to live with that. But for now, for this moment, I am the Doctor
again. Thank you. Which one is mine? Ha!  
(He goes into the shabbiest Tardis. It dematerialises.)

**[Tardis 8.5]**

(The Warrior begins to regenerate.)  
WARRIOR: Oh yes, of course. I suppose it makes sense. Wearing a bit thin. I
hope the ears are a bit less conspicuous this time.

**[National Gallery]**

DOCTOR 10: I won't remember either, so you might as well tell me.  
DOCTOR: Tell you what?  
DOCTOR 10: Where it is we're going that you don't want to talk about.  
DOCTOR: I saw Trenzalore, where we're buried. We die in battle among millions.  
DOCTOR 10: That's not how it's supposed to be.  
DOCTOR: That's how the story ends. Nothing we can do about it. Trenzalore is
where you're going.  
DOCTOR 10: Oh, never say nothing. Anyway, good to know my future is in safe
hands. Keep a tight hold on it, Clara.  
CLARA: On it.  
(He kisses her hand.)  
DOCTOR 10: Trenzalore. We need a new destination, because I don't want to go.  
(He gets into the next, not brightly painted, Tardis and it dematerialises.)  
DOCTOR: He always says that.  
CLARA: Need a moment alone with your painting?  
DOCTOR: How did you know?  
CLARA: Those big sad eyes.  
DOCTOR: Ah.  
CLARA: I always know. Oh, by the way, there was an old man looking for you. I
think it was the curator.  
(She goes into the Tardis. The Doctor sits and looks at the painting.)  
DOCTOR: I could be a curator. I'd be great at curating. I'd be the Great
Curator. I could retire and do that. I could retire and be the curator of this
place.  
CURATOR: You know, I really think you might.  
(Yes, that is the current silver haired version of the fourth Doctor you just
heard. There's Tom Baker, leaning on a walking stick.)  
DOCTOR: I never forget a face.  
CURATOR: I know you don't. And in years to come, you might find yourself
revisiting a few. But just the old favourites, eh?  
(The Doctor winks.)  
CURATOR: You were curious about this painting, I think. I acquired it in
remarkable circumstances. What do you make of the title?  
DOCTOR: Which title? There's two. No More or Gallifrey Falls.  
CURATOR: Oh, you see, that's where everybody's wrong. It's all one title.
Gallifrey Falls No More. Now, what would you think that means, eh?  
DOCTOR: That Gallifrey didn't fall. It worked. It's still out there.  
CURATOR: I'm only a humble curator. I'm sure I wouldn't know.  
DOCTOR: Then where is it?  
CURATOR: Where is it indeed? Lost. Shush. Perhaps. Things do get lost, you
know. And now you must excuse me. Oh, you have a lot to do.  
DOCTOR: Do I?  
CURATOR: Mmm.  
DOCTOR: Is that what I'm supposed to do now? Go looking for Gallifrey?  
CURATOR: Oh, it's entirely up to you. Your choice, eh? I can only tell you
what I would do if I were you. Oh, if I were you. Oh, perhaps I was you, of
course. Or perhaps you are me. Congratulations.  
DOCTOR: Thank you very much.  
CURATOR: Or perhaps it doesn't matter either way. Who knows, eh? Who knows?  
(The Curator leaves a happy Doctor.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Clara sometimes asks me if I dream. Of course I dream, I tell
her. Everybody dreams. But what do you dream about, she'll ask. The same thing
everybody dreams about, I tell her. I dream about where I'm going. She always
laughs at that. But you're not going anywhere, you're just wandering about.  
(He walks out to join his past selves, backs to us, gazing out at the stars.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: That's not true. Not any more. I have a new destination. My
journey is the same as yours, the same as anyones. It's taken me so many
years, so many lifetimes, but at last I know where I'm going.  
(A big golden planet hangs in the sky. He stands between the 10th and 8.5
Doctors.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Where I've always been going. Home, the long way round.  
(Final shot, a front view of the known Doctors. Left to right - 2, 4, 6, 8,
8.5, 11, 10, 9, 7, 5, 3 and behind them, number one.)
