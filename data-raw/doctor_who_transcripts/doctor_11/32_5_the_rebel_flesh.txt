**The Rebel Flesh**  
  
Original Airdate: 21 May, 2011  

**[Corridor]**

(A monastery cum castle on an island. Think St Michael's Mount, but a bit
flatter and further from any shoreline.)  
JIMMY: Lights.  
(The lights come on and the two men and a woman walk forward. They are wearing
protective clothing.)

**[Acid room]**

JIMMY: Lights. You know the drill, people. Plastic visors down and locked.
Buzzer?  
(Buzzer raises the lid on a large vat.)  
JENNIFER: Reading of nine point seven.  
JIMMY: Sounds a bit low for unrefined. How's the average?  
JENNIFER: The acid potency stats have definitely dropped below the mean during
the last quarter.  
BUZZER: Prettier than a computer, isn't she?  
JENNIFER: Give over, Buzz.  
(Buzzer is standing on the edge of the vat when she gives him a nudge. He
falls in.)  
JENNIFER: Buzzer. Buzz.  
JIMMY: Oh, great. Nice going, twinkle toes.  
JENNIFER: I shouldn't have swung at him. Sorry, Buzz. My bad.  
BUZZER: No, you're all right. Jimmy?  
JIMMY: Well, no point carrying you back legless. Sorry, Buzzer. You're dead.  
BUZZER: Well, this is a right pain in the armour. Heart's gone now.  
JIMMY: Look, we'd best get off. Got to write this one up for the boss. Those
suits cost a bomb. If I miss my boy's birthday filling out forms, I'll kill
you again.  
(Buzzer raises a farewell hand, which melts. Jennifer and Jimmy leave.)  
JIMMY: Lights.

**[Corridor]**

JENNIFER: I'm looking at these readings, Jimmy, and the potency stats are way
too low. We may have to take that read again. This thing is still jamming up
on me.  
BUZZER: So I think we'd better talk about what just happened back there. I
could get compensation. I've seen the holo-ads. Had an accident in the
workplace? Yeah, I have as it goes. I melted.  
JIMMY: Let it go.  
BUZZER: Just remember. When you're doing your report, it wasn't my fault. She
took a swing at me.  
JENNIFER: I never touched you. You've got two left feet, Buzzer.  
BUZZER: I haven't got two left feet. Or any arms, neck, head, the chin. This
body costs money, love.  
JIMMY: Not as much as that acid suit.  
BUZZER: Oh, lighten up. It's not like anyone was hurt.  
(The version of Buzzer in the acid vat finally dissolves.)

**[Tardis]**

(Loud music reverberates through the Tardis. I'm told it is called
Supermassive Black Hole by Muse. Whatever. Rory and Amy are playing darts.)  
AMY: Forty six. Rubbishy, rubbishy, rubbish.  
RORY: Hello? It's a double top.  
AMY: Wrong side of the wire, mister.  
RORY: You're on the oche, Red.  
(The scanner still cannot decide whether Amy is pregnant or not. The Doctor
turns off the music.)  
DOCTOR: Who wants fish and chips?  
(Rory raises his hand.)  
DOCTOR: I'll drop you both off. Take your time. Don't rush.  
RORY: Er, and you? Things to do. Things involving other things.  
AMY: Well, we'll stay with you. We'll do the other things.  
DOCTOR: Nope.  
AMY: Whatever you're up to, I'd personally like to be a part of it. What?  
(A klaxon blares, then everyone gets thrown around.)  
DOCTOR: Solar tsunami. Came directly from your sun. A tidal wave of radiation.
Big, big, big.  
RORY: Oh Doctor, my tummy's going funny.  
DOCTOR: Well, the gyrator disconnected. Target tracking is out.  
(The Tardis heads for Earth.)  
DOCTOR: Assume the position!  
(Amy and Rory put their heads between their knees, then it all goes still.)  
DOCTOR: Textbook landing.

**[St John's Island]**

DOCTOR: Behold, a cockerel! Love a cockerel.  
(A weathervane.)  
DOCTOR: And underneath, a monastery. Thirteenth century.  
AMY: Oh, we've gone all mediaeval.  
RORY: I'm not sure about that.  
AMY: Really? Mediaeval expert are you?  
RORY: No, it's just that I can hear Dusty Springfield.  
(You Don't Have To Say You Love Me. The Doctor inspects a hole in the ground
with a pipe running through it. The pipe is labelled Danger Corrosive.)  
DOCTOR: These fissures are new. Solar tsunami sent out a huge wave of gamma
particles. This is caused by a magnetic quake that occurs just before the wave
hits.  
AMY: Well, the monastery's standing.  
(The Doctor takes a snow globe out of his pocket and shakes it.)  
DOCTOR: Yeah, for now.  
RORY: Doctor, look.  
DOCTOR: Yeah. It's a supply pipe. Ceramic inner lining. Something corrosive.
They're pumping something nasty off this island to the mainland.  
RORY: My mum's a massive fan of Dusty Springfield.  
DOCTOR: Who isn't? Right, let's go. Satisfy our rabid curiosity.

**[Courtyard]**

AMY: So where are these Dusty Springfield loving monks, then?  
DOCTOR: I think we're here. This is it.  
RORY: Doctor, what are you talking about? We've never been here before.  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
AMY: We came here by accident?  
DOCTOR: Accident? Yes, I know. Accident.  
RORY: Ow!  
DOCTOR: Acid. They're pumping acid off this island. That's old stuff. Fresh
acid, you wouldn't have a finger.  
TANNOY: Intruder alert. Intruder alert.  
DOCTOR: There are people coming. Well, almost.  
AMY: Almost coming?  
DOCTOR: Almost people.  
RORY: I think we should really be going.  
AMY: Come on!  
RORY: I'm telling you. When something runs towards you, it is never for a nice
reason.

**[Harness room]**

(Buzzer and others are reclining in harnesses in the alcoves.)  
AMY: What are all these harnesses for?  
RORY: The almost people?  
AMY: What are they, prisoners, or are they meditating, or what?  
DOCTOR: Well, at the moment they fall into the or what category.  
TANNOY: Halt and remain calm.  
DOCTOR: Well, we've halted. How are we all doing on the calm front?  
JIMMY: Don't move!  
BUZZER: Stay back, Jen. We don't know who they are.  
JENNIFER: So let's ask them. Who the hell are you?  
(Amy looks around at the same people in the harnesses.)  
DOCTOR: Well, I'm the Doctor, and this is Amy and Rory, and it's all very
nice, isn't it?  
AMY: Hold up. You're all. What are you all? Like identical twins?  
(Two more people walk in wearing acid suits. The woman seems to be in charge.)  
CLEAVES: This is an Alpha Grade industrial facility. Unless you work for the
military or for Morpeth Jetson, you are in big trouble.  
DOCTOR: Actually, you're in big trouble.  
(He gets out the psychic paper.)  
CLEAVES: Meteorological Department? Since when?  
DOCTOR: Since you were hit by a solar wave.  
CLEAVES: Which we survived.  
DOCTOR: Just, by the look of it. And there's a bigger one on the way.  
CLEAVES: Which we'll also survive. Dicken, scan for bugs.  
BUZZER: Backs against the wall. Now.  
DOCTOR: You're not a monastery, you're a factory. Twenty second century army-
owned factory.  
AMY: You're army?  
CLEAVES: No, love. We're contractors, and you're trespassers.  
DICKEN: It's clear, boss.  
CLEAVES: All right, weatherman, your ID checks out. If there's another solar
storm, what are you going to do about it? Hand out sunblock?  
DOCTOR: I need to see your critical systems.  
CLEAVES: Which one?  
DOCTOR: You know which one.

**[Flesh room]**

(Another vat, this time filled with bubbling milky liquid.)  
DOCTOR: And there you are.  
CLEAVES: Meet the government's worst kept secret. The Flesh. It's fully
programmable matter. In fact, it's even learning to replicate itself at the
cellular level.  
AMY: Right. Brilliant. Lost.  
CLEAVES: Okay. Once a reading's been taken, we can manipulate its molecular
structure into anything. Replicate a living organism down to the hairs on its
chinny chin chin. Even clothes. And everything's identical. Eyes, voice  
DOCTOR: Mind, soul?  
CLEAVES: Don't be fooled, Doctor. It acts like life but it still needs to be
controlled by us, from those harnesses you saw.  
RORY: Wait, whoa. Hold it. So, you're Flesh now?  
CLEAVES: I'm lying in a harness back in that chamber. We all are, except
Jennifer here. Don't be scared. This thing, just like operating a forklift
truck.  
DOCTOR: You said it could grow. Only living things grow.  
CLEAVES: Moss grows. It's no more than that. This acid is so dangerous we were
losing a worker every week. So now we mine the acid using these doppelgangers.
Or Gangers. If these bodies get burnt or fall in the acid  
BUZZER: Then who the hell cares, right, Jen?  
JENNIFER: Nerve endings automatically cut off like airbags being discharged.
We wake up and get a new Ganger.  
JIMMY: It's weird, but you get used to it.  
CLEAVES: Jennifer, I want you in your Ganger. Get back to the harness.  
(Jennifer leaves. The Doctor scans the Flesh.)  
BUZZER: Hang on, what's he up to? What you up to, pal?  
DOCTOR: Stop it. Strange. It was like for a moment there it was scanning me.  
CLEAVES: Doctor.  
(The Doctor's hand is pulled to the surface of the Flesh.)  
CLEAVES: Get back, Doctor. Leave it alone.  
(He finally yanks his hand back.)  
DOCTOR: I understand.  
AMY: Doctor? Are you all right?  
DOCTOR: Incredible. You have no idea. No idea. I mean, I felt it in my mind. I
reached out to it, and it to me.  
CLEAVES: Don't fiddle with the money, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: How can you be so blinkered? It's alive. So alive. You're piling your
lives, your personalities directly into it.  
(Bang, flash.)  
DOCTOR: It's the solar storm. The first waves come in pairs. Pre-shock and
fore-shock. It's close.  
CLEAVES: Buzzer, we got anything from the mainland yet?  
BUZZER: No, the comms are still too jammed with radiation.  
CLEAVES: Okay. Then we'll keep pumping acid until the mainland says stop. Now
why don't you stand back and let us impress you?

**[Harness room]**

COMPUTER: ID confirmed. Jennifer Lucas.  
JENNIFER: The meter is running.  
(Jennifer puts her hand on a scanner then gets into her harness.)  
JENNIFER: Cardio and respiratory online. Motor functions online. Plumbing in.

**[Flesh room]**

(A smaller tank is filling with Flesh. A face appears in it and a few moments
later a new Jennifer sits up.)  
DOCTOR: Well, I can see why you keep it in a church. Miracle of life.  
BUZZER: No need to get poncey. It's just gunge.  
CLEAVES: Guys, we need to get to work.  
JIMMY: Okay, everybody, let's crack on.  
DOCTOR: Did I mention the solar storm? You need to get out of here.  
JIMMY: Where do you want us to go? We're on a tiny island.  
DOCTOR: Well, I can get you all off it.  
CLEAVES: Don't be ridiculous. We've got a job to do.  
DOCTOR: It's coming.  
JENNIFER: That's the alarm.  
DOCTOR: How do you get power?  
CLEAVES: We're solar. We use a solar router. The weathervane.  
DOCTOR: Big problem.  
JIMMY: Boss, maybe if the storm's back we should get underground. The
factory's seen better days. The acid pipes might not withstand another hit.  
CLEAVES: We have two hundred tons of acid to pump out. We fall behind, we stay
another rotation. Anyone want that?  
DOCTOR: Please, you are making a massive mistake here. You're right at the
crossroads of it. Don't turn the wrong way. If you don't, if you don't prepare
for this storm, you are all in terrible danger. Understand?  
CLEAVES: My factory, my rules.  
DOCTOR: I need to check the progress of the storm. Monitoring station?
Monitoring station.  
JENNIFER: Three lefts, a right and a left. Third door on your left.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.

**[Monitoring station]**

(A big storm lights up the sky.)  
DOCTOR: Waves disturbing the Earth's magnetic field. There is going to be the
mother and father of all power surges. See this weathervane, the cock-a-
doodle-do? It's a solar router feeding the whole factory with solar power.
When that wave hits, ka-boom. I've to get to that cockerel before all hell
breaks loose. I never thought I'd have to say that again. Amy, breathe.  
AMY: Yeah! I mean, thanks. I'll try.  
(The Doctor heads up the spiral staircase to the tower top. The weathervane is
spinning very fast.  
Down in the harness room, the Gangers are watching their originals as the
storm gathers force.  
Down in the crypt and outside, pipes burst and acid leaks out. The ground
below the Tardis dissolves, and it sinks.  
Up in the air, the Doctor opens the Danger High Voltage box and starts pulling
relays. There is a strike and he is thrown off the ladder.  
Electricity blasts down into the Flesh vat. All the Gangers faces become
slightly molten, and they cry out.  
After a short time, the Doctor wakes. The weathervane has been destroyed. The
monastery goes dark.)

**[Flesh room]**

(Amy and Rory are out cold on the floor.)  
RORY: Oh. For want of a better word, ow!

**[Courtyard]**

DOCTOR: Cleaves, you're not in your harness.  
CLEAVES: I'm sorry, Doctor. You were right.  
DOCTOR: You've lost all power to the factory.  
CLEAVES: Doctor, I abandoned my team.  
DOCTOR: Then let's go get them.

**[Corridor]**

DOCTOR: How long would you say we were unconscious for, Cleaves?  
CLEAVES: Not long. A minute, two minutes?  
DOCTOR: I'd hazard we've been out a teensy bit longer.  
CLEAVES: Well, how long?  
DOCTOR: An hour. I've seen whole worlds turned inside out in an hour. A lot
can go wrong in an hour.

**[Harness room]**

(Buzzer is being helped down from his harness.)  
BUZZER: I feel like I been toasted.  
JIMMY: What the hell happened?  
AMY: The tsunami happened. You hurt?  
JIMMY: It feels like the National Grid's run through my bones but apart from
that  
BUZZER: I hope the meter's not bust. I still want to get paid.  
RORY: Jennifer! Jennifer. Hey, all right?  
JENNIFER: It hurt so much.  
RORY: Hey. Hey, it's okay. It's over.  
(Rory comforts Jennifer. Amy doesn't look happy about it.)  
JENNIFER: I couldn't get out of my harness.  
RORY: Shush.  
JENNIFER: I thought I was going to die.  
RORY: Welcome to my world.  
(The Doctor and Cleaves run in.)  
AMY: Doctor, these are all real people, so where are their Gangers?  
CLEAVES: Don't worry. When the link shuts down the Gangers return to pure
Flesh. Now, the storm's left us with acid leaks all over, so we need to
contact the mainland. They can have a rescue shuttle out here in no time.  
(The Dusty Springfield song starts up.)  
JIMMY: That's my record. Who's playing my record?  
DOCTOR: Your Gangers. They've gone walkabout.  
CLEAVES: No, it's impossible. They're not active. Cars don't fly themselves,
cranes don't lift themselves and Gangers don't

**[Dining hall]**

BUZZER: No way.  
CLEAVES: I don't, I don't believe this.  
JIMMY: They could've escaped through the service door at the back.  
BUZZER: This is just like the Isle of Sheppey.  
DOCTOR: It would seem the storm has animated your Gangers.  
CLEAVES: They've ransacked everything.  
DOCTOR: Not ransacked, searched.  
CLEAVES: Through our stuff!  
DOCTOR: Their stuff.  
JIMMY: Searching for what?  
DOCTOR: Confirmation. They need to know their memories are real.  
BUZZER: Oh, so they've got flaming memories now.  
DOCTOR: They feel compelled to connect to their lives.  
CLEAVES: Their stolen lives.  
DOCTOR: No, bequeathed. You gave them this. You poured in your personalities,
emotions, traits, memories, secrets, everything. You gave them your lives.
Human lives are amazing. Are you surprised they walked off with them?  
BUZZER: I'll say it again. Isle of Sheppey. Ganger got an electric shock,
toddled off, killed his operator right there in his harness. I've seen the
photos. This bloke's ear was all hanging  
JIMMY: Even if this has actually happened, they can't remain stable without us
plumbed in to them, can they, boss.  
CLEAVES: Guess we'll find out.  
RORY: Are you okay? Do you need some water?  
JENNIFER: I feel funny. I need the washroom.  
RORY: I'll come with you.  
(Rory follows Jennifer out. Dicken sneezes and makes Amy jump.)  
DICKEN: Sorry.  
AMY: Oh! Okay.  
(The Doctor examines a card tower on the table.)  
BUZZER: That's me. It's good to have a hobby. So what, my Ganger did that all
on its own?  
DOCTOR: Who taught you to do this?  
BUZZER: My granddad.  
DOCTOR: Well, your Ganger's granddad taught him to do it, too. You both have
the same childhood memories, just as clear, just as real.  
BUZZER: No.  
DOCTOR: Scared, disorientated, struggling to come to terms with an entire life
in their heads.

**[Washroom]**

RORY: The Doctor's always saying don't wander off. First rule with him,
actually. Don't wander off.  
JENNIFER: I just need a minute.  
RORY: Oh, yeah. Sure. Take all the time you need. I've got your back. You're
fine.  
(In the mirror, Jennifer's face flickers from human to part-formed Ganger and
back. She slumps forward and a piece of Flesh falls into the sink.)  
RORY: Er, Jennifer? What's up, Jennifer?  
(Jennifer runs into a cubicle.)  
We er, we'd better get going. Everything okay in there, Jen?  
(A hand comes out through a hole in the cubicle door on an elongated arm,
hitting Rory and breaking the mirror. Then Jennifer's head comes out on a
stretchy neck.)  
JENNIFER: Just let us live.  
(Rory runs away.)

**[Dining hall]**

JIMMY: We need to protect ourselves.  
(The Doctor pops a meal into the microwave.)  
DOCTOR: Are you a violent man, Jimmy?  
JIMMY: No.  
DOCTOR: Then why would the other Jimmy be?  
CLEAVES: Don't tell me you can eat at a time like this, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: You told me we were out cold for a few minutes, Cleaves, when in fact
it was an hour.  
CLEAVES: Sorry, I just assumed  
DOCTOR: Well, it's not your fault. Like I said, they're disoriented. Amy, when
you got to the alcoves, who was in harness?  
AMY: Jimmy and Dicken were helping Buzzer out.  
DOCTOR: Jennifer?  
AMY: She was standing on her own when we got to her.  
(The microwave dings. The Doctor hands the plate to Cleaves.)  
DOCTOR: It's hot.  
(Cleaves drops the plate.)  
DOCTOR: Trans-matter's still a little rubbery. Nerve endings not quite fused
properly.  
CLEAVES: What are you talking about?  
DOCTOR: It's okay.  
CLEAVES: Why didn't I feel that?  
DOCTOR: You will. You'll stabilise.  
CLEAVES: No, stop it. You're playing stupid games. Stop it!  
DOCTOR: You don't have to hide. Please, trust me. I'm the Doctor.  
(Cleaves turns around with a Ganger face. Buzzer grabs a knife and Jimmy holds
him back.)  
BUZZER: Where's the real Cleaves, you thing? What have you done with her?  
DOCTOR: That's it. Good, you remember. This is early Flesh. The early stages
of the technology. So much to learn.  
AMY: Doctor, what's happened to her?  
DOCTOR: She can't stabilise. She's shifting between half-formed and full-
formed, for now at least.  
CLEAVES: We are living.  
(She runs out of the room, screaming.)  
DOCTOR: Let her go.  
AMY: Doctor, Rory.  
DOCTOR: Rory?  
AMY: Rory!  
DOCTOR: Oh, Rory. Rory! Always with the Rory.

**[Monastery]**

(Their way is blocked by the contents of some broken drums.)  
JIMMY: Explosion must've ruptured the acid feeds. We're going to need the acid
suits.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no. We haven't got time. Back, back, back!  
(Rory comes upon the spill from the other direction.)  
JENNIFER [OC]: Rory? Rory? Rory?  
(Rory hides. Her face is half-formed.)

**[Washroom]**

AMY: Rory.  
(There is a hole punched in the wall to the outside.)  
DOCTOR: Of course, Jennifer's a Ganger too.  
AMY: Doctor, you said they wouldn't be violent.  
DOCTOR: But I did say they were scared and angry.  
JIMMY: And early technology, is what you said. You seem to know something
about the Flesh.  
AMY: Do you? Doctor?  
JIMMY: You're no weatherman. Why are you really here?  
DOCTOR: I have to talk to them. I can fix this.  
JIMMY: Wait. What's going on? Where's the real Jennifer?

**[Corridor]**

(Another pipe ruptures.)  
DOCTOR: It is too dangerous out here with acid leaks.  
AMY: We have to find Rory.  
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm going back to the Tardis. Wait for me in the dining hall. I
want us to keep together, okay. No more wandering off.  
AMY: And what about Rory?  
DOCTOR: Well, it would be safer to look for Rory and Jennifer with the Tardis.  
JIMMY: Here we go. Distress flares.  
DOCTOR: Exit?  
JIMMY: Keep going straight. Can't miss it. But you're never going to get your
vehicle in here.  
DOCTOR: I'm a great parker.  
JIMMY: We really need those acid suits. I've sent Buzzer and Dicken to get
them.  
AMY: Fine and dandy. I'm just going to find my husband, so cheers.  
JIMMY: Amy, I wouldn't.  
AMY: Nor would I. What can you do, eh?  
JIMMY: At least wait for an acid suit.

**[Locker room]**

(Rory finds Jennifer.)  
G-JENNIFER: When I was a little girl, I got lost on the moors, wandered off
from the picnic. I can still feel how sore my toes got inside my red welly
boots. And I imagined another little girl, just like me, in red wellies, and
she was Jennifer too. Except she was a strong Jennifer, a tough Jennifer.
She'd lead me home. My name is Jennifer Lucas. I am not a factory part. I had
toast for my breakfast. I wrote a letter to my mum. And then you arrived. I
noticed your eyes right off.  
RORY: Did you?  
G-JENNIFER: Nice eyes. Kind.  
RORY: Where is the real Jennifer?  
G-JENNIFER: I am Jennifer Lucas. I remember everything that happened in her
entire life. Every birthday, every childhood illness. I feel everything she
has ever felt and more. I'm not a monster! I am me. Me! Me! Me!  
(She looks completely human now.)  
G-JENNIFER: Why did they do this to us? Help me, Rory. Help me.  
RORY: Shush, shush.

**[Flesh room]**

(The Doctor scans the vat with his sonic screwdriver, then leaves. A pair of
lips appear in the vat.)  
LIPS: Trust me.

**[St Johns Island]**

(Just the top of the Tardis is visible, sticking out of the ground.)  
DOCTOR: Oh. What are you doing down there?  
(Then he notices that his shoes are dissolving. He abandons them and runs back
into the monastery.)

**[Locker room]**

BUZZER: Clear.  
(The Acid Suit locker is empty.)  
BUZZER: Those damn Gangers got to the acid suits.  
DICKEN: There is acid leaking everywhere. Did you see the boss' eyes back
there in the hall?  
BUZZER: I've never seen a Ganger look at me like that.  
DICKEN: I don't know what they are now, but they ain't us.  
(Dicken sneezes.)

**[Acid room]**

(Ganger Dicken, Buzzer and Jimmy are waiting for their leader.)  
G-CLEAVES: We have the advantage now. We have the acid suits. We can move
freely. Strike at will.

**[Monastery]**

RORY: Are you sure you're feeling better? No more super-elastic punches?  
G-JENNIFER: I'm different now. Stronger.  
RORY: The Doctor won't hurt you. He wants to help, Jennifer, okay?  
G-JENNIFER: You used my name. You used my name. Thank you.  
(She kisses Rory.)  
G-JENNIFER: Amy's a lucky girl.  
RORY: Yeah, she is. Let's go.  
(Someone was hiding up a staircase, listening. It is dark, but I think it was
Cleaves.)

**[Room]**

AMY: Rory. Rory?  
(The Eye Patch woman is looking through a hatch in the far wall.)

**[Corridor]**

(Amy slams the door shut again.)  
RORY: Amy!  
AMY: You're okay. What happened?  
(G-Jennifer peeks out from behind Rory's back.)  
RORY: She needs protecting.  
(Buzzer and Dicken come up from behind.)  
BUZZER: Jen?  
AMY: No, it's a Ganger. Rory, listen.  
RORY: Look, you listen. Nobody touches her.

**[Acid room]**

(The Doctor finds the acid suits, and the Gangers.)  
DOCTOR: Hello. How are you all getting on?  
G-CLEAVES: Why don't you tell us?  
DOCTOR: Well, we have two choices. The first is to tear each other apart. Not
my favourite. The second is to knuckle down and work together. Try to work out
how best we can help you.

**[Corridor]**

(The Doctor leads the Gangers out.)  
DOCTOR: Now, I know its hard for you to hold your fully human form. That's why
you keep shifting between the Flesh stages, but do try. It'll make the others
less scared of you.

**[Dining hall]**

BUZZER: Where's Jen? What have you done with her?  
G-JENNIFER: I haven't seen her, I swear. But look, I'm her. I'm just like her.
I'm real.  
JIMMY: You're a copy. You're just pretending to be like her.  
AMY: Rory, we don't really know anything about them yet.  
RORY: Well, I know that she's afraid and she needs our help.  
G-JENNIFER: Jimmy, Buzzer. Come on, you guys. We've worked together for two
years.  
BUZZER: I worked with Jennifer Lucas, not you.  
AMY: Okay, let's not do anything at all  
AMY + DOCTOR: Until the Doctor gets here. Hello.  
(The Gangers look fully human. This is going to get confusing.)  
JIMMY: This is  
G-JIMMY: You're telling me.  
G-CLEAVES: All right, Doctor, you've brought us together. Now what?  
DOCTOR: Before we do anything, I have one very important question. Has anybody
got a pair of shoes I could borrow? Size ten. Although I should warn you, I
have very wide feet.

**[Locker room]**

CLEAVES: That's it, Doctor befriend them. Team up with them, why don't you?
Make a football team. How about that? You're going to have us all together
singing campfire songs.  
(She collects some equipment.)

**[Dining room]**

(The Doctor has acquired boots.)  
DOCTOR: The Flesh was never merely moss. These are not copies. The storm has
hardwired them. They are becoming people.  
JIMMY: With souls?  
DICKEN: Rubbish! Achoo.  
DOCTOR: Bless you. We were all jelly once. Little jelly eggs sitting in goop.  
AMY: Yeah, thanks. Too much information.  
DOCTOR: We are not talking about an accident that needs to be mopped up. We
are talking about sacred life. Do you understand? Good. Now, the Tardis is
trapped in an acid pool. Once I can reach her, I can get you all off this
island, humans and Gangers, eh? How does that sound?  
JIMMY: Can I make it home for Adam's birthday?  
G-JIMMY: What about me? He's my son too.  
JIMMY: You? You really think that?  
G-JIMMY: I feel it.  
JIMMY: Oh, so you were there when he was born, were you?  
G-JIMMY: Yeah. I drank about eight pints of tea, then they told me I had a wee
boy and I just burst out laughing. No idea why. I miss home, as much as you.  
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not going to lie to you. It's a right old mess, this. But as
you might say up North, oh well, I'll just go to't foot of stairs. Eee by by
gum. Or not. Good. Right. First step is we get everyone together, then get
everyone safe. Then, get everyone out of here.  
AMY: But we're still missing Jennifer and Cleaves.  
JIMMY: I'll go and look for them.  
G-JIMMY: I'll give you a hand, if you like. Cover more ground.  
JIMMY: Yeah, okay. Thanks.  
CLEAVES: This circus has gone on long enough.  
G-CLEAVES: Oh, great. You see, that is just so typically me.  
CLEAVES: Doctor, tell it to shut up!  
DOCTOR: Cleaves, no. No, no.  
CLEAVES: Circuit probe. Fires about ooo, forty thousand volts? Would kill any
one of us, so I guess she'll work on Gangers just the same.  
DOCTOR: It's interesting you refer to them as it, but you call a glorified
cattle prod a she.  
CLEAVES: When the real people are safely off this island, then I'll happily
talk philosophy over a pint with you, Doctor.  
AMY: What are you going to do to them?  
CLEAVES: Sorry. They're monsters. Mistakes. They have to be destroyed.  
DOCTOR: Give me the probe, Cleaves.  
CLEAVES: We always have to take charge, don't we, Miranda. Even when we don't
really know what the hell is going on.  
(Ganger Buzzer tries to rush her. Cleaves zaps him.)  
DOCTOR: Argh! He's dead!  
CLEAVES: We call it decommissioned.  
DOCTOR: You stopped his heart. He had a heart. Aorta, valves, a real human
heart. And you stopped it.  
RORY: Jen?  
G-JENNIFER: What happened to Buzzer will happen to all of us if we trust you.  
DOCTOR: Wait, wait, just wait.  
RORY: No!  
(Rory jumps Cleaves and disconnects the power from the probe. The Gangers run
away.)  
AMY: You idiot!  
DOCTOR: Wait! Look at what you have done, Cleaves.  
CLEAVES: If it's war, then it's war. You don't get it, Doctor. How can you?
It's us and them now. Us and them.  
DICKEN: Us and them.  
JIMMY: (sighs) Us and them.

**[Acid room]**

G-JENNIFER: You tried. We all tried and look what they did. Us and them now.  
G-JIMMY: Us and them.  
G-DICKEN: Us and them.  
G-CLEAVES: Jennifer.  
G-JENNIFER: Buzzer warned you it was a trick and now he's dead. If we want to
live, then it's time to go to war. I'll take care of the spare one running
around out there.

**[Flesh room]**

(Jennifer hobbles in. The lips now have a body, but we don't see it.)  
VOICE: Trust me.  
(Jennifer runs.)

**[Dining hall]**

RORY: Look, I just wanted to help her.  
AMY: Well, we all do, okay?  
RORY: Don't be like that. Listen, she's  
AMY: I said I agree with you. Drop it.  
DOCTOR: The most fortified and defendable room in the monastery. Cleaves, the
most fortified and defendable room in the monastery.  
CLEAVES: The chapel.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
CLEAVES: Only one way in. Stone walls two feet thick.  
DOCTOR: You've crossed one hell of a line, Cleaves. You've killed one of them.
They're coming back, in a big way.  
(They are, dressed in the acid suits.)

**[Corridor]**

RORY [OC]: Jennifer!  
JENNIFER: Rory?  
(Her Ganger is watching her, stuck to the ceiling.)

**[Outside the Chapel]**

JIMMY: What about the flares?  
DOCTOR: We'll worry about the flares when we're locked inside. Rory, Pond.  
(There is a scream.)  
AMY: Rory, come on.  
RORY: Jen's out there. She's out there and she's on her own.  
DOCTOR: Well, if she's got any sense, then she's hiding. Rory!  
RORY: I can't leave her out there!  
DOCTOR: Rory.  
RORY: I know you understand that.  
AMY: Get in here. Get in here!  
(The Gangers approach. Rory ducks down a side corridor.)  
G-CLEAVES: There they are.  
DOCTOR: Amy.  
AMY: Rory!

**[Chapel]**

DOCTOR: Amy, they are not after him, they're after us.  
VOICE [OC]: Why? Why?  
DOCTOR: Show yourself. Show yourself!

**[Corridor]**

RORY: Jennifer?

**[Chapel]**

AMY: Doctor!  
CLEAVES: Pass me the barrel.  
DICKEN: We need something heavy. Anything you can find.  
(They barricade the door.)  
JIMMY: This is insane. We're fighting ourselves.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, it's insane, and it's about to get even more insanerer. Is
that a word? Show yourself, right now!  
AMY: Doctor, we are trapped in here and Rory's out there with them. Hello? We
can't get to the Tardis and we can't even leave the island.  
G-DOCTOR: Correct in every respect, Pond. It's frightening, unexpected,
frankly a total, utter splattering mess on the carpet, but I am certain, one
hundred percent certain, that we can work this out. Trust me. I'm the Doctor.
