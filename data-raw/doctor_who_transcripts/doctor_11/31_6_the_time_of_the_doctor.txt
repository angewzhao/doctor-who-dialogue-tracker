Original Airdate: 8 May, 2010  

**[Throne room]**

(Venice, 1580. In a large, otherwise empty chamber, a woman sits on a throne
under a canopy, with her son standing at her side. Her Steward leads in a man
and his young daughter.)  
GUIDO: Signora, your school offers a chance for betterment, escape. My
daughter. Isabella is seventeen now, but what prospects are there for the
daughter of a boat builder? There's no future for us. No future but you.  
ROSANNA: I am moved by your concern for your daughter. I believe protecting
the future of one's own is a sacred duty.  
GUIDO: Signora, she is my world.  
ROSANNA: Then we will take your world.  
(This makes Guido and his daughter very happy.)  
GUIDO: I knew it.  
ROSANNA: Say goodbye to your daughter.  
GUIDO: Now, signora?  
ROSANNA: Why wait? Time ticks.  
GUIDO: Be brave, my girl. Make me proud.  
(The Steward escorts Guido out.)  
ROSANNA: Step into the light, my dear. That's it.  
(Rosanna and her son circle her.)  
ROSANNA: What say you, Francesco? Do you like her?  
FRANCESCO: Oh, I do, Mother. I do.  
(Francesco shows his teeth. They are small and sharp, like a bat's. Isabella
screams.)

**[Pub]**

(Rory is on the phone, trying to make himself heard above the noise of his
stag party. All the participants are wearing red t-shirts with Rory's Stag on
the back and a picture of Rory and Amy inside a heart on the front.)  
RORY: Hey! It's me. Hello. How are you?

**[Amy's bedroom]**

(He is talking to the answerphone.)  
RORY [OC]: The reason for this call is because I haven't told you for seven
hours that I love you, which is a scandal, and even if we weren't getting
married tomorrow, I'd ask you to marry me anyway.

**[Pub]**

RORY: Yes, I would, because you are smashing.  
(A giant pink cake is wheeled in to the tune 'The Stripper'.)  
RORY: Oh. Oh. Oh, blimey. I've. I've, er got to go. I'll see you tomorrow.  
(His companions push Rory forward.)  
ALL: Out. Out. Out.  
(The Doctor bursts out of the fake cake and silence falls.)  
DOCTOR: Rory! That's a relief. I thought I'd burst out of the wrong cake,
again. That reminds me, there's a girl standing outside in a bikini. Could
someone let her in and give her a jumper? Lucy? Lovely girl. Diabetic. Now
then, Rory. We need to talk about your fianc
