**Asylum of the Daleks**  
  
Original Airdate: 1 Sep, 2012  

_**[Prequel]** _

_(The Doctor is enjoying tea and a biscuit in a tea room when he sees a
cloaked figure with no visible face sitting across the room. No one else
notices. Then it is sitting opposite him.)  
DOCTOR: I don't think I asked you to sit.  
FIGURE: There is a woman who wants to meet you.  
DOCTOR: That's nice, but I'm married.  
FIGURE: Your help is required.  
DOCTOR: I don't discuss my business in public.  
FIGURE: I know.  
(A wave of the hand, and they are the only people in the tea room.)  
DOCTOR: Who are you?  
FIGURE: A messenger.  
DOCTOR: Whose messenger?  
FIGURE: Darla von Karlsen.  
DOCTOR: Never heard of her.  
(He stands up. The location has changed.)  
DOCTOR: Where's the tea room?  
FIGURE: You were never in the tea room.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Of course. Psychic projection. Someone's sending me a dream
message. Well, I hope I fell asleep somewhere comfy.  
FIGURE: Do you recognise where you are?  
(Children's laughter off.)  
DOCTOR: Can't remember. How do you hang up on this thing?  
FIGURE: You can't.  
DOCTOR: Oh yeah? And what if I just wake up?  
(In a deckchair on a beach.)  
FIGURE: No, Doctor. The beach isn't real either. You are still dreaming.  
(In space.)  
FIGURE: Spacetime coordinates. You will meet Darla von Karlsen here. Her
daughter is in danger, and only you can save her. You recognise the planet?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
FIGURE: Say it.  
DOCTOR: No.  
FIGURE: Name the planet.  
DOCTOR: I will not say that name.  
FIGURE: Say it.  
DOCTOR: No!  
(The Doctor wakes up underneath the time rotor.)  
FIGURE [OC]: Name the planet. Name the planet. Name the planet.  
DOCTOR: Skaro. _

**[Skaro]**

(A scene of utter devastation and persisting rainfall. We pan around a giant
Dalek statue covered in mould and mess.)  
DARLA [OC]: First, there were the Daleks. And then, there was a man who fought
them. And then, in time, he died. There are a few, of course, who believe this
man somehow survived, and that one day he will return. For both our sakes,
dearest Hannah, we must hope these stories are true.  
(A robed figure wearing high heels turns to a shadow with the profile of the
Doctor walking inside the eyepiece of the statue.)  
DOCTOR: I got your message. Not many people can do that. Send me messages.  
DARLA: I have a daughter, Hannah. She's in a Dalek prison camp. They say you
can help.  
DOCTOR: Do they? I wish they'd stop. I love your choice of meeting place.  
DARLA: They said I'd have to intrigue you.  
DOCTOR: Skaro. The original planet of the Daleks. Look at the state of it. Who
told you about me?  
DARLA: Does it matter?  
DOCTOR: Maybe not, but you're very well informed. If Hannah's in a Dalek
prison camp, tell me, why aren't you?  
DARLA: I escaped.  
DOCTOR: (chuckles) No. Nobody escapes the Dalek camps. You're very cold.  
DARLA: What's wrong?  
DOCTOR: It's a trap.  
DARLA: What is?  
DOCTOR: You are, and you don't even know it.  
(The Doctor backs away as a Dalek eyepiece comes out of her forehead, then a
gun out of her right palm. He is shot, and a Dalek saucer appears in the sky.)  
DALEK [OC]: The Doctor is acquired.

**[Photoshoot]**

(Amy is modelling for the cameras in a stately home when the Personal
Assistant gestures to her.)  
AMY: I'll just be a minute.  
PA: Your husband is here.  
AMY: Hmm. I don't have a husband.  
PA: Oh, well, apparently you still do.

**[Dressing room]**

RORY: You have to sign these.  
AMY: And then we're not married?  
RORY: Just like magic.  
(Amy signs.)  
AMY: Can't chat. Working.  
RORY: Really? Thought you were just pouting at a camera.  
AMY: Rory?  
(Rory leaves and Cassandra the make-up artist enters. One of the bulbs on the
make up dresser is flashing.)  
CASSANDRA: Sorry, love. Was I interrupting?  
AMY: No.  
CASSANDRA: Gosh, look at you. You've gone so pale. Come on, take a seat. We'll
soon sort that out.  
(But Cassandra sprouts a Dalek eyepiece instead.)  
DALEK [OC]: Amelia Pond is acquired.

**[Bus]**

(Rory gets on board.)  
RORY: Cheers.  
(He sit down. The bus driver stares at him in his mirror, then a Dalek
eyepiece grows from his forehead. The bus is filled with white light.)  
DALEK [OC]: Rory Williams is acquired.

**[White room]**

(Rory wakes up on the floor of a circular room. Amy is standing nearby.)  
RORY: Where are we?  
(He gets up and looks out of the small window. There is a fleet of Dalek
saucers outside.)  
RORY: So how much trouble are we in?  
(The door opens and a Dalek enters.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: How much trouble, Mister Pond?  
(The Doctor enters, under escort.)  
DOCTOR: Out of ten? Eleven.  
(The ceiling opens and the floor rises, lifting them into -)

**[Parliament]**

(A large domed area with a multitude of Daleks in tiers around them, and the
White Supreme Dalek nearby, along with an organic Dalek and the Tardis.)  
AMY: Where are we? A spaceship, right?  
DOCTOR: Not just any spaceship. The Parliament of the Daleks. Be brave.  
AMY: What do we do?  
DOCTOR: Make them remember you. Well, come on then. You've got me. What are
you waiting for? At long last, it's Christmas! Here I am.  
(The Doctor closes his eyes tight, expecting to die. The organic Dalek
speaks.)  
DALEK PM: Save us. You will save us.  
DOCTOR: I'll what?  
DALEK: You will save the Daleks.  
DALEKS: Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks.
Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks.  
DOCTOR: Well.  
DALEKS: Save the Daleks.  
DOCTOR: This is new.

**[Room]**

(A musical box plays Carmen as a young brunette nails planks over the round
window. It is a neat room with a hammock and a microwave.)  
OSWIN [OC]: Day three six three. The terror continues. Also, made another
soufflé, very nearly. Check defences. They came again last night. Still always
at night. Maybe they're vampires. Oh, and it's my mum's birthday. Happy
birthday, mum.  
OSWIN: I did make you a soufflé, but it was too beautiful to live.  
DALEK [OC]: You will let us enter! We will enter! We will enter!  
(She turns up the volume on Carmen. Toreador blasts out.)

**[Parliament]**

RORY: What's he doing?  
AMY: He's chosen the most defendable area in the room, counted all the Daleks,
counted all the exits, and now he's calculating the exact distance we're
standing apart and starting to worry. Oh, and look at him frowning now.  
(Dalek Darla is there.)  
AMY: Something's wrong with Amy and Rory, and who's going to fix it? And he
straightens his bow tie.  
DALEK PM: We have arrived.  
DOCTOR: Arrived where?  
DALEK PM: Doctor.  
DARLA: The Prime Minister will speak with you now.  
DOCTOR: Do you remember who you were before they emptied you out and turned
you into their puppet?  
DARLA: My memories are only reactivated if they are required to facilitate
cover or disguise.  
DOCTOR: You had a daughter.  
DARLA: I know. I've read my file.  
(The Doctor walks up to the Prime Minister, who is the organic Dalek.)  
DOCTOR: Well?  
DALEK PM: What do you know of the Dalek Asylum?  
DOCTOR: According to legend, you have a dumping ground. A planet where you
lock up all the Daleks that go wrong. The battle-scarred, the insane, the ones
even you can't control. It's never made any sense to me.  
DALEK PM: Why not?  
DOCTOR: Because you'd just kill them.  
DALEK PM: It is offensive to us to extinguish such divine hatred.  
DOCTOR: Offensive?  
DALEK PM: Does it surprise you to know the Daleks have a concept of beauty?  
DOCTOR: I thought you'd run out of ways to make me sick. Hello again. You
think hatred is beautiful.  
DALEK PM: Perhaps that is why we have never been able to kill you.  
(A hole opens in the middle of the floor. The Doctor and Darla walk back to
it. A planet is visible.)  
DARLA: The Asylum. It occupies the entire planet, right to the core.  
DOCTOR: How many Daleks are in there?  
DARLA: A count has not been made. Millions, certainly.  
DOCTOR: All still alive?  
DARLA: It has to be assumed. The Asylum is fully automated. Supervision is not
required.  
AMY: Armed?  
DARLA: The Daleks are always armed.  
RORY: What colour? I'm sorry, there weren't any good questions left.  
DARLA: This signal is being received from the very heart of the Asylum.  
(Carmen comes over the speakers.)  
WHITE: What is the noise? Explain. Explain.  
DOCTOR: Er, it's me.  
RORY: Sorry, what?  
DOCTOR: It's me, playing the triangle. Okay, I got buried in the mix. Carmen.
Lovely show. Someone's transmitting this. Have you considered tracking back
the signal and talking to them? He asked the Daleks.

**[Room]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Hello? Hello? Carmen

**[Parliament]**

DOCTOR: Hello?

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Hello?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Come in. Come in.

**[Parliament]**

DOCTOR: Come in, Carmen.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Hello! Yes, yes, sorry. Do you read me?

**[Parliament]**

DOCTOR: Yes, reading you loud and clear. Identify

**[Room]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Yourself and report your status.  
OSWIN: Hello. Are you real? Are you actually, properly, real?

**[Parliament]**

DOCTOR: Yes, confirmed. Actually, properly, real.  
OSWIN [OC]: Oswin Oswald, junior entertainment officer, starship

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Alaska. Current status, crashed and shipwrecked somewhere not nice.
Been here a year, rest of the crew missing. Provisions good but keen to move
on.

**[Parliament]**

DOCTOR: A year? Are you okay? Are you under attack?  
OSWIN [OC]: Some local lifeforms.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Been keeping them out.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Do you know what those lifeforms are?  
OSWIN: I know a Dalek when I hear one, yeah.

**[Parliament]**

DOCTOR: What have you been doing on your own against the Daleks for a year?

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Making soufflés?

**[Parliament]**

DOCTOR: Soufflés? Against the Daleks? Where'd you get the milk?  
WHITE: This conversation is irrelevant.  
DOCTOR: No, it isn't.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: No! Hello? Hello?

**[Parliament]**

DOCTOR: Because a starliner has crashed into your Asylum, and someone's got
in. And if someone can get in, then everything can get out. A tsunami of
insane Daleks. Even you don't want that.  
WHITE: The Asylum must be cleansed.  
DOCTOR: Then why is it still here? You've enough firepower on this ship to
blast it out of the sky.  
DARLA: The Asylum forcefield is impenetrable.  
DOCTOR: Turn it off.  
DARLA: It can only be turned off from within the Asylum.  
DOCTOR: A small taskforce could sneak through a forcefield. Send in a couple
of Daleks. Oh. (applauds) Oh. Oh, that's good. That's brilliant. You're all
too scared to go down there. Not one of you will go, so tell me, what do the
Daleks do when they're too scared?  
WHITE: The Predator of the Daleks will be deployed.  
DOCTOR: You don't have a Predator, and even if you did, why would they turn
off a forcefield for you?  
DALEK PM: Because you will have no other means of escape.  
DARLA: May I clarify? The Predator is the Dalek's word for you.  
DOCTOR: Me? Me?  
DARLA: You will need this. It will protect you from the nanocloud.  
(Two humanoids put a wristband on the Doctor's wrist.)  
DOCTOR: The what? The nano what?  
DARLA: The gravity beam will convey you close to the source of the
transmission. You must find a way to deactivate the forcefield from there.  
DOCTOR: You're going to fire me at a planet? That's your plan? I get fired at
a planet and expected to fix it.  
RORY: In fairness, that is slightly your M O.  
DOCTOR: Don't be fair to the Daleks when they're firing me at a planet.  
(Rory and Amy have wristbands put on them, too.)  
DOCTOR: What do you want with them?  
WHITE: It is known the Doctor required companions.  
RORY: Oh, brilliant. Good oh.  
DOCTOR: Don't worry. We'll get through this, I promise. Don't be scared.  
(Amy's Look could melt granite.)  
AMY: Scared? Who's scared. Geronimo.  
DOCTOR: Ha! Oi!  
(The humanoids push our trio into the gravity beam.)

**[Gravity beam]**

ALL: Argh!  
RORY: Wrong way up! Wrong way up!  
(Rory plummets past the Doctor and Amy, head first.)  
AMY: Doctor!  
(The beam splits into three.)

**[Snowfield]**

(Amy lands on a snowy landscape with a brilliant blue sky. A black man in
white thermals drops his drill - labelled Alaska - and runs to them.)  
HARVEY: Hello? Hello? Who are you? You okay?  
AMY: Rory? Doctor?  
HARVEY: I'm Harvey. No. Who's Rory?  
(Harvey chases after Amy.)  
HARVEY: Where are you going?  
(Over the ridge, a series of eyepieces pop up and down from under the snow to
look at the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, ha, ha, ha.  
(Then Carmen plays.)  
OSWIN [OC}: Sorry, sorry. Pressed the wrong switch.  
DOCTOR: Soufflé girl?

**[Room]**

OSWIN: You can always call me Oswin, seeing as that's my name. You okay?  
DOCTOR [on screen]: How are you doing that, eh? This is Dalek technology.  
OSWIN: It's very easy to hack.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: No, it isn't. Where are you?  
OSWIN: The ship broke up when it hit. Somewhere underground, I think. You
coming to get me?  
AMY [OC]: Doctor?  
(The picture starts to break up.)  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Hey! Oi! Soufflé girl!  
OSWIN: Damn.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Come back!

**[Snowfield]**

AMY: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Amy! Hey, where's Rory?  
HARVEY: There was another beam. There. Over there. Are you the rescue team?  
(They run across the snow.)

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Hello?

**[Snowfield]**

(A shaft has been drilled through the snow and rock.)  
AMY: Rory? Rory! Rory!

**[Chamber]**

(Meltwater pours down the walls, and something green drips onto Rory's face,
waking him up. There are lots of inanimate Daleks here. He touches one, but it
doesn't respond so he pushes it away.)

**[Snowfield]**

HARVEY: We came down two days ago. There's twelve of our escape pods. I don't
know what happened to them.  
AMY: Alaska? That's the same ship as soufflé girl.  
(Harvey opens a hatch covered in snow.)  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Except she's been here a year.

**[Escape pod]**

HARVEY: We should have some climbing rope long enough for that hole.  
DOCTOR: Won't you introduce us to your crew?  
HARVEY: Ah, yes, sorry. Guys, this is the Doctor and Amy.  
(No response.)  
HARVEY: Guys?  
(The crew are desiccated corpses.)  
HARVEY: Oh, my god.  
(The Doctor does a quick sonic scan.)  
DOCTOR: They're dead. All of them.  
HARVEY: That's not possible. I just spoke to them. Two hours ago. We were
doing engine repairs.  
DOCTOR: You're sure about that, are you? Because I'd say they've all been dead
for a very long time.  
HARVEY: But they can't have been.  
AMY: Well, they didn't get in this state in two hours.  
HARVEY: No, of course. Stupid me.  
AMY: Of course what?  
HARVEY: I died outside, and the cold preserved my body. I forgot about dying.  
(Out pops the Dalek eyepiece. The Doctor grabs a CO2 fire extinguisher and
lets it off in Harvey's face.)  
DOCTOR: Amy, the door!  
AMY: Come on, come on.  
(Harvey is backed through a door that Amy manages to get open, then closes and
locks again.)  
AMY: Explain. That's what you're good at. How'd he get all Daleked?  
DOCTOR: Because he wasn't wearing one of these. Oh, ho, ho. That's clever. The
nanocloud. Microorganisms that automatically process any organic matter,
living or dead, into a Dalek puppet. Anything attacks this place, it
automatically becomes part of the on-site security.  
AMY: Living or dead?  
DOCTOR: These wristbands protect us. The only thing stopping us going exactly
the way he did  
AMY: Doctor, shut up! Living or dead?  
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Living or, or  
(The corpses have glowing eyepieces, and are starting to move.)  
DOCTOR: Dead. Oh dear.  
(The Doctor kicks the zombies so he and Amy can get into the -)

**[Cockpit]**

(He pulls Amy's arm out of the zombie's grasp and seals the bulkhead door.)  
AMY: Is it bad that I've really missed this?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
AMY: Good.  
DOCTOR: I know.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Unauthorised personnel may not enter the cockpit.

**[Cockpit]**

DOCTOR: Shut up.  
OSWIN [OC]: Oh, Mister Grumpy.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Bad combo. No sense of humour in that chin.  
AMY [on screen]: Is that her again, soufflé girl?  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Yeah, she. Oi, what is wrong with my chin?  
OSWIN: Careful, dear. You'll put someone's eye out.

**[Cockpit]**

OSWIN [OC]: Scanning you. You're in another of the escape pods from the
Alaska, right?

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Same ship I was on.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: How can you hack into everything? It should be impossible.
You're in a crashed ship!  
OSWIN: Long story. Is there a word for total screaming genius that sounds
modest and a tiny bit sexy?  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Doctor. You call me the Doctor.  
OSWIN: See what you did there.  
(Beep.)  
OSWIN: Check the floor. I'm picking up a breach at floor level. There could be
a way out. See you later.

**[Cockpit]**

DOCTOR: Ah ha! Hatch. Looks like it's been used already and they've tried to
block it off behind them.  
AMY: Can't imagine why.  
DOCTOR: The lower part of the pod is buried, so this must go straight down to
the Asylum.  
AMY: Where Rory is.  
DOCTOR: Speaking of Rory, is there anything you want to tell me?  
AMY: Are we going to do this now?  
DOCTOR: What happened?  
AMY: Oh, stuff. You know. We split up. What can you do?  
DOCTOR: What can I do?  
AMY: Nothing. It's not one of those things you can fix like you fix your
bowtie. Don't give me those big wet eyes, Raggedy Man. It's life. Just life.
That thing that goes on when you're not there.  
(The Doctor gets the hatch open. A shaft heads down into the planet, with a
flexible metal ladder hanging down it.)  
AMY: Okay, so somebody else got out this way, then.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, let's go and find them. Oh, hello, hello, hello. What are they
up to?  
(The zombies are on a small monitor on the wall, waving something at the
camera.)  
AMY: What's that?  
DOCTOR: One of these. (a wristband) But where did they get it?  
(They pulled it off Amy's wrist a few minutes ago.)  
AMY: Doctor, they got it from me.  
DOCTOR: Oh, Amy.  
AMY: Doctor, what's going to happen to me? Seriously. Tell me what.

**[Chamber]**

(Rory is using the small penlight he always carries when he serves divorce
papers on his wife to explore his surroundings. He kicks a piece of metal, and
a Dalek's eyepiece starts to glow.)  
RORY: Shush.  
(Other Daleks start to boot up, too, making sounds.)  
RORY: What? Sorry, what?  
DALEK: Eg eg eg eg eg eg eg.  
RORY: Eggs? You mean those things?  
(The roundels on the Dalek's casing. Some have fallen off onto the floor.)  
DALEK: Egg.  
RORY: I don't, I don't know what you want. Those things. Are those things
eggs? This? You want this.  
DALEK: Egg. Stir. Min. Ate.  
(Rory drops the ball.)  
DALEK: Exterminate.  
DALEKS: Exterminate.  
(One weapon blast just misses him. Rory tries to run the gauntlet.)  
DALEK: Emergency. Emergency. Exterminate. Exterminate.  
OSWIN [OC]: Run! The door at the end, run for it. They're waking up, but
they're slow. The door at the end. Just run. Now! Now! Now!  
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
(The door rises up as Rory runs. He slides underneath and it shuts behind
him.)

**[Corridor]**

OSWIN [OC]: So, anyway, I'm Oswin. What do I call you?  
RORY: Er, I can't remember. Er, Rory.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Lovely name, Rory. First boy I ever fancied was called Rory.  
RORY [on screen]: Okay.  
OSWIN: Actually, she was called Nina. I was going through a phase.

**[Corridor]**

OSWIN [OC]: Just flirting to keep you cheerful.  
DALEKS [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
RORY: Er, okay, any time you want to start flirting again is fine by me.

**[Another corridor]**

(The Doctor and Amy are climbing down the ladder from the cockpit into another
corridor.)  
AMY: So tell me, what's going to happen to me? And don't lie. Because I know
when you're lying to me and I will definitely fall on you.  
DOCTOR: The air all around is full of micro-machines. Robots the size of
molecules. Nanogenes. Now that you're unprotected, you're being re-written.  
AMY: So, what happens? I get one of those things sticking out of my head?  
DOCTOR: Physical changes come later.  
AMY: What comes first? How does it start?  
DOCTOR: With your mind. Your feelings, your memories, and I'm sorry but it's
started already.  
AMY: How do you know?  
DOCTOR: Because we've had this conversation four times.  
AMY: Okay, scared now.  
DOCTOR: Hang on to scared. Scared isn't Dalek.

**[Corridor]**

(Rory's torch starts to flicker.)  
OSWIN [OC]: Hey there, beakie boy.  
RORY: If it's a straight choice, I prefer Nina.  
OSWIN [OC]: Loving this. The nose and the chin.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: You two could fence. There's a door behind you.  
(The door rises and Rory runs through into a room with a large round platform
in the middle.)  
OSWIN: In there, quickly. Okay, you're safe for now. Pop your shirt off, quick
as you like.  
RORY [on screen]: Why?  
OSWIN: Does there have to be a reason?

**[Chamber]**

(A door rises to let Amy and the Doctor into the place where Rory met the
Daleks. The bad-tempered pepperpots are still repeating their favourite word
some way away. The Doctor sniffs.)  
AMY: What's that?  
(They back out again.)

**[Outside the chamber]**

DOCTOR: Keep a look out. Don't open this door. Oswin!  
(Amy's head hurts.)  
DOCTOR: Oswin, can you hear me?

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Hello, the chin. I have visual on you.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Why don't I have a visual on you? Why can't I ever see
you?  
OSWIN: Limited power, bad hair, take your pick. There's a door to your left.
Open it.

**[Outside the chamber]**

OSWIN [OC]: I'm going to send you a map to that screen. I put your little
friend somewhere safe. I can get you to him.

**[Room]**

DOCTOR [on screen]: Rory. You found Rory?  
OSWIN: I call him Nina. Personal thing. Hush now.

**[Outside the chamber]**

(Amy looks through the transparent panels in the door and sees a man in a suit
standing in the chamber.)  
AMY: Who are you? Doctor?  
(There are lots of people in the chamber now, men and women in various styles
of dress from formal evening wear to a little red-haired girl in a ballet
tutu. Amy opens the door and goes in.)

**[Room]**

DOCTOR [on screen]: How many Daleks directly ahead of me right now?  
OSWIN: Ten, twenty.

**[Outside the chamber]**

OSWIN [OC]: Hard to say. Some of them are catatonic but they do have
firepower.  
DOCTOR: How do I get past them? Amy!

**[Chamber]**

AMY: Shush. It's okay, it's just people in here. It's just people.  
DOCTOR: Amy, it's the nanocloud, it's altering your perception. Look again.
Look again. Those aren't people.  
(Now she sees Daleks.)  
DOCTOR: Amy, come out. Take my hand. Run! Run!

**[Corridor]**

(They run back to the rope ladder, which is moving under the weight of
descending zombies.)  
AMY: Look, they're coming down!  
DOCTOR: Er, oh yes, they are.  
DALEK: Intruder.  
DOCTOR: Run.  
DALEK: Intruder.  
(They hide in the cubby hole Oswin opened for the Doctor.)  
DALEK: Intruder.  
(It runs out of power. They come out of the cubby hole again.)  
DOCTOR: It's damaged.  
AMY: Okay, but what do we do?  
DOCTOR: Identify me. Access your files. Who am I? Come on. Who's your daddy?  
DALEK: You are the Predator.  
DOCTOR: Access your standing orders concerning the Predator.  
DALEK: The Predator must be destroyed.  
DOCTOR: And how are you going to do that, Dalek? Without a gun you're a
tricycle with a roof. How are you going to destroy me?  
DALEK: Self-destruct initiated.  
AMY: What's it doing?  
DOCTOR: It's going to blow itself up, and I with it. Only weapon it's got
left.  
DALEK: Self-destruct cannot be countermanded.  
(It's internal clock is down to 12. The Doctor lifts its lid and scans
inside.)  
DOCTOR: I'm not looking for a countermand, dear. I'm looking for reverse.  
DALEK: Forward, forward.  
(The Dalek whizzes backwards into the chamber, bumps into a colleague and
blows up.)

**[Teleport room]**

(The explosion is felt here.)  
RORY: Oswin?

**[Room]**

RORY [on screen]: What was that? That was close.

**[Chamber]**

(Rory runs in to see the smoking remains of Dalek shells.)  
RORY: Oswin? What happened? Who killed all the Daleks?  
(The Doctor enters from the other side, carrying Amy.)  
DOCTOR: Who do you think?

**[Teleport room]**

(The Doctor lays Amy on the teleport pad.)  
RORY: Will sleeping help her? Will it slow down the process?  
OSWIN [OC]: You'd better hope so

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Because pretty soon she's going to try and kill you.

**[Teleport room]**

DOCTOR: Amy.  
AMY: Ow.  
DOCTOR: Amy. Still with us.  
RORY: Amy, it's me. Do you remember me?  
(Amy slaps Rory.)  
RORY: She remembers me.  
DOCTOR: Same old Amy.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Do you know how you make someone into a Dalek? Subtract love, add
anger. Doesn't she seem a bit too angry to you?

**[Teleport room]**

AMY: Well, somebody's never been to Scotland.  
DOCTOR: What about you, though, Oswin. How come you're okay?

**[Room]**

DOCTOR [on screen]: Why hasn't the nanocloud converted you?  
OSWIN: I mentioned the genius thing, yeah? Shielded in here.

**[Teleport room]**

DOCTOR: Clever of you. Now, this place. The Daleks said it was fully
automated. Look at it. It's a wreck.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Well, I've had nearly a year to mess with them, and not a lot else to
do.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: A junior entertainment manager hiding out in a wrecked
ship, hacking the security systems of the most advanced warrior race

**[Teleport room]**

DOCTOR: The universe has ever seen. But you know what really gets me about
you, Oswin? The soufflés. Where do you get milk

**[Room]**

DOCTOR [on screen]: For the soufflés?

**[Teleport room]**

DOCTOR: Seriously. Is no one else wondering about that?  
RORY: No. Frankly, no. Twice.  
OSWIN [OC]: So, Doctor.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: I've been looking you up. You're all over the database. Why do the
Daleks call you the Predator?  
DOCTOR [on screen]: I'm not the Predator, I'm just a man with a plan.  
OSWIN: You've got a plan?

**[Teleport room]**

RORY: That's all he is.  
AMY: There's a nose joke going if someone wants to pick that one off.  
DOCTOR: In no particular order, we need to neutralise all the Daleks in this
Asylum, rescue Oswin from the wreckage, escape from this planet and fix Amy
and Rory's marriage.  
AMY: Okay, I'm counting three lost causes. Anyone else?  
DOCTOR: Oswin, there's a Dalek ship in orbit.  
OSWIN [OC]: Yes. Got it on the sensors  
DOCTOR: The Asylum has a forcefield. The Daleks upstairs are waiting for me to
turn it off. Soon as I do, they'll burn this whole world and us with it.

**[Room]**

DOCTOR [on screen]: So, Oswin, my question is this. How fast can you drop the
forcefield?  
OSWIN: Pretty fast. But why would I?  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Because this is a teleport. Am I right, Oswin?  
OSWIN: Yeah. Internal use only.

**[Teleport room]**

DOCTOR: I can boost the power. Once the forcefield is down, I can use it to
beam us right off this planet.  
RORY: You said when the forcefield is down, the Daleks will blow us up.  
DOCTOR: We'll have to be quick, yes.  
AMY: Fine, we'll be quick. But where do we beam to?  
DOCTOR: The only place within range. The Dalek ship.  
AMY: They'll exterminate us on the spot.  
RORY: Ah, so this is the kind of escape plan where you survive about four
seconds longer.  
DOCTOR: What's wrong with four seconds? You can do loads in four seconds.
Oswin, how fast can you drop the forcefield?

**[Room]**

OSWIN: I can do it from here, as soon as you come and get me.

**[Teleport room]**

DOCTOR: No, just drop the forcefield and come to us.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: There's enough power in that teleport for one go. Why would you wait
for me?

**[Teleport room]**

DOCTOR: Why wouldn't I?

**[Room]**

OSWIN: No idea. Never met you. Sending you a map so you can come get me.

**[Teleport room]**

RORY: This place is crawling with Daleks.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Yeah. Kind of why I'm anxious to leave. Come up and see me sometime.

**[Teleport room]**

RORY: So, are we going to go get her?  
DOCTOR: I don't think that we have a choice. Okay, as soon as the forcefield
is down the Daleks will attack. If it gets too explody-wody in here, you go
without me, okay?  
RORY: And leave you to die?  
DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry about me. You're the one beaming up to a Dalek ship to
get exterminated.  
RORY: Fair point. Love this plan. What about Amy?  
DOCTOR: Keep her remembering, keep her focused. That'll hold back the
conversion.  
AMY: What do I do?  
DOCTOR: You heard what she said. They're subtracting love. Don't let them.

**[Corridor]**

(The Doctor makes his way carefully.)  
DALEKS [OC]: Emergency. Emergency. Prepare to be annihilated. Emergency. We
are the Daleks. We are the Daleks.

**[Teleport room]**

RORY: Okay, look at me. I'm going to be logical. Cold and logical, okay? For
both of our sakes, for both of us, I'm going to take this off my wrist and put
it on yours.  
AMY: Why? Then it'll just start converting you. That's not better.  
RORY: Yes, but it'll buy us time, because it'll take longer with me.  
AMY: Sorry, what?  
RORY: It subtracts love, that's what she said.  
AMY: What's that got to do with it? What does that even mean?  
RORY: It's arithmetic. It'll take longer with me because we both know, we've
always known, that. Amy, the basic fact of our relationship is that I love you
more than you love me, which today is good news because it might just save
both of our lives.  
AMY: How can you say that?  
RORY: Two thousand years, waiting for you outside a box. Don't say it isn't
true, you know it's true. Give me your arm. Amy!  
(Amy slaps Rory.)  
AMY: Don't you dare say that to me. Don't you ever dare.  
RORY: Amy, you kicked me out.  
AMY: You want kids. You have always wanted kids. Ever since you were a kid.
And I can't have them.  
RORY: I know.  
AMY: Whatever they did to me at Demons Run, I can't ever give you children. I
didn't kick you out. I gave you up.  
RORY: Amy, I don't  
AMY: Don't you dare talk to me about waiting outside a box, because that is
nothing, Rory, nothing, compared to giving you up.  
RORY: Just give me your arm. Let me put this on you. Just give me your arm!  
AMY: Don't touch me!  
(She is already wearing a wristband.)  
RORY: It's the Doctor's. When you were sleeping  
AMY: That Time Lord. What's the betting he doesn't even need it.  
RORY: Why didn't he just tell us?  
(Amy sees the Doctor straighten his bow tie on a monitor.)

**[Corridor]**

DOCTOR: Oswin, I think I'm close.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: You are. Less than twenty feet away. Which is the good news.

**[Corridor]**

DOCTOR: Okay. And the bad which I suddenly feel is coming?

**[Room]**

OSWIN: You're about to pass through Intensive Care.

**[Intensive Care]**

(The Daleks here are in cages.)  
DOCTOR: What's so special about this lot, then?  
OSWIN [OC]: Don't know.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Survivors of particular wars. Spiridon, Kembel, Aridius, Vulcan,
Exxilon. Ringing any bells?

**[Intensive Care]**

DOCTOR: All of them.  
OSWIN [OC]: Yeah? How?  
DOCTOR: These are the Daleks who survived me.  
DALEK: Doctor.  
DALEK 2: Doctor.  
DALEKS: Doctor.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: That's weird. Those ones don't usually wake up for anything.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Yeah, well

**[Intensive Care]**

DOCTOR: Special visitor. Okay, door, but it won't open. I can't be far away,
though.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Hang on. Not quite sure. There's a release code. Let me just

**[Intensive care]**

OSWIN [OC]: Anything out there?  
DOCTOR: No.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Hang on, I'm trying to think.

**[Intensive Care]**

(One Dalek has been disarmed, literally, and chained up.)  
DALEK: Doctor.  
(It breaks its chains.)  
DALEKS: Doctor. Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oswin, get this door open.

**[Room]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Oswin, open this door!  
OSWIN: I can't!

**[Intensive Care]**

DOCTOR: Oswin.  
(The Daleks are closing in.)

**[Room]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Just get this door open!

**[Intensive Care]**

DOCTOR: Oswin! Oswin, please! Get this door open! Help me!  
(A plunger is heading for the Doctor's face.)  
DOCTOR: Stop!  
(The Daleks stop, then turn away.)  
OSWIN [OC]: Oh, that is cool.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Tell me I'm cool, chin boy.

**[Intensive Care]**

DOCTOR: What, what did you do?

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Hang on, I think I've found the door thingy.

**[Intensive Care]**

DOCTOR: No, tell me what you did.  
OSWIN [OC]: The Daleks, they have a hive mind. Well, they don't, they have a
sort of telepathic web.  
DOCTOR: The path web, yes.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: I hacked into it, did a mass delete

**[Intensive Care]**

OSWIN [OC]: On all the information connected with the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: You made them forget me?

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Good, eh? And here comes the door.

**[Intensive Care]**

(The door rises.)  
DOCTOR: I've tried hacking into the path web. Even I couldn't do it.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Come and meet the girl who can. Hey, you're right outside. Come on in.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Oswin, we have a problem.  
OSWIN: No, we don't. Don't even say that. Joined the Alaska to see the
universe, ended up stuck in a shipwreck first time out. Rescue me, chin boy,
and show me the stars.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Does it look real to you?  
OSWIN: Does what look real?  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Where you are right now.

**[Padded cell]**

DOCTOR: Does it seem real?

**[Room]**

OSWIN: It is real.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: It's a dream, Oswin. You dreamed it for yourself because
the truth was too terrible.  
OSWIN: Where am I?

**[Padded cell]**

(A Dalek has chains draped over it.)  
DALEK: Where am I? Where am I?  
DOCTOR: Because you are a Dalek.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: I am not a

**[Padded cell]**

DALEK: Dalek. I am not a Dalek!

**[Room]**

OSWIN: I'm human.

**[Padded cell]**

DOCTOR: You were human when you crashed here. It was you who climbed out of
the pod. That was your ladder.  
OSWIN [memory]: Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?

**[Room]**

OSWIN: You mean?

**[Padded cell]**

DALEK: Human.  
DOCTOR: Not any more. Because you're right. You're a genius. And the Daleks
need genius. They didn't just make you a puppet, they did a full conversion.

**[Room]**

OSWIN [memory]: Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Oswin, I am so sorry, but you are a Dalek. The milk,
Oswin. The milk and the eggs for the souffléss. Where, where did it all come
from?  
OSWIN [memory]: Eggs. I'm human. I am not a Dalek, I am human. I am not Dalek,
I am human!

**[Padded cell]**

DALEK: Eggs.  
DOCTOR: It wasn't real. It was never real.  
OSWIN [memory]: I am a Dalek. I am a Dalek.  
OSWIN + DALEK: Eggs.  
DALEK: Stir. Min. Ate.  
DOCTOR: Oswin.  
DALEK: Eggs.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Stir. Min ate.

**[Padded cell]**

DALEK: Exterminate.  
DOCTOR: Oswin. No, no, no, Oswin. Oswin.  
DALEK: Exterminate!  
DOCTOR: Listen. Oswin, you don't have to do this.  
DALEK: Exterminate!

**[Room]**

DOCTOR [on screen]: Oswin!  
(Oswin is crying.)  
OSWIN: Why do they hate you

**[Padded cell]**

DALEK: So much? They hate you so much. Why?  
DOCTOR: I fought them many, many times.  
DALEK: We have grown stronger in fear of you.  
DOCTOR: I know. I tried to stop.

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Then run.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: What did you say?  
OSWIN: I've taken down the forcefield.

**[Padded cell]**

DALEK: The Daleks above have begun their attack. Run!

**[Room]**

DOCTOR [on screen]: Oswin, are you  
OSWIN: I am Oswin Oswald. I fought the Daleks and I am

**[Padded cell]**

DALEK: Human! Remember me.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
DALEK: Run!  
(The Doctor runs as the bombardment starts.)

**[Room]**

OSWIN: Run, you clever boy. And remember.

**[Teleport room]**

RORY: How long can we wait?  
AMY: The rest of our lives.  
RORY: Agreed.  
(They kiss as things go bang around them and the Doctor runs in.)  
DOCTOR: Right, go! Let's go. We're good. Let's go. Oh, for God's sake.  
(The Doctor takes the control unit from Rory and activates it. Nothing appears
to happen. Missiles streak in and the entire planet goes KaBOOM!)

**[Parliament]**

WHITE: The Asylum is destroyed.  
DALEK: Incoming teleport from Asylum planet. We are under attack.  
WHITE: Prepare to defend. Defend. Defend!  
DALEK PM: Explain, Dalek Supreme.  
DOCTOR [OC]: You know, you guys should really have seen this coming. The thing
about me and teleports, I've got a really good aim. Pin-point accurate, in
fact. Or, to put it another way  
(The Doctor looks out of the Tardis door.)  
DOCTOR: Suckers!  
DALEK: Identify yourself. Identify. Identify.  
DOCTOR: It's me. You know me. The Doctor. The Oncoming Storm. The Predator.  
DARLA: Titles are not meaningful in this context. Doctor who?  
DALEK PM: Doctor who?  
DALEKS: Doctor who?  
DOCTOR: Oh, Oswin. Oh, you did it to them all. You beauty.  
DALEKS: Doctor who? Doctor who?  
DOCTOR: Fellas, you're never going to stop asking.  
(He shuts the door and the Tardis dematerialises.)  
DALEKS: Doctor who?

**[Street]**

(Amy and Rory wave goodbye as the Tardis dematerialises, then she goes
indoors.)  
RORY: Yes! Yes!  
AMY [OC]: I can see you.  
RORY: Okay.

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor dances as he sets the controls.)  
DOCTOR: Doctor who. Doctor who. Doctor Who!
