**Shada**  
  
Original Airdate: _Not broadcast_  

_Transcriber's note - Shada (pronounced Shah-da) was not fully made, due to
union action at the BBC, and never broadcast apart from the sequence of the
Doctor and Romana punting on the River Cam and a bit of chase scene which was
used in the Five Doctors.) The existing footage was released on videotape with
linking narration by Tom Baker filmed in the Doctor Who area of the Museum Of
The Moving Image, which sadly closed in 1999.  
In 2003, Big Finish Productions was commissioned to make an  audio version
with Paul McGann.  
The BBC completed the story with animation and released it on DVD 4th Dec
2017. _

__**Part One**__

**[FSAS Space Station]**

(Inside a space station hanging by a red giant star, six men dressed in white
sit in recliners with their heads towards a central device with a globe on it.
Very Alien. A monitor starts counting down in roman numerals, from XXX. One of
the men is  Christopher Neame, who is dressed slightly differently from the
others, and has a nasty scar down his right cheek. When the countdown
finishes, his eyes open. Another count begins, this time going upwards. The
other five men start jerking in their seats while our man gets up and goes to
a wall panel, where he presses some buttons. The countdown reverses back up to
XXX. The men stop jerking, and voices begin whispering. Eventually they become
still. Our man walks to a control console and flicks some more switches. A
male voice comes from the speakers.)  
COMPUTER [OC]: This is a recorded message. The Foundation for the Study for
Advanced Sciences is under strict quarantine. Do not approach. Do not
approach. Everything is under our control.  
(The man holds up his hand, and the sphere from the top of device rises into
the air and glides into it. He leaves. The computer repeats its message as the
man goes into the shuttlebay. Then the five remaining men jerk briefly and get
up. They stagger around then fall down as a spaceship undocks and flies away.)

**[St Cedd's College]**

(Daniel Hill bicycles through Cambridge like any other student, on a bike with
a wicker basket on the front, then puts it into a stand outside a college
entrance and walks through to the quad. He checks a piece of paper then stops
a student.)  
PARSONS: Excuse me.  
STUDENT: Yeah?  
PARSONS: Do you know where P14 is?  
STUDENT: Yes, it's over there, okay?  
PARSONS: Thanks.  
(He heads off across the inner yard flagstones to the Don's climber-covered
residential block.)

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(A white-haired and bearded Professor wearing a black academic gown is
unpacking a briefcase. He unwinds his scarf and removes the gown to reveal a
slightly tatty jacket underneath. His study is lined from floor to ceiling
with bookshelves, and the tables are also loaded with volumes. A police
telephone box sits somewhat out of place amongst it all. The Professor looks
at it, then goes and draws his curtains. There is a knock at the door.)  
CHRONOTIS: Come in.  
(Parsons enters. Chronotis does not look to see who it is, but heads off to
the kitchen.)  
CHRONOTIS: Excuse the muddle. Creative disarray, you know.  
PARSONS: Professor Chronotis?  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Tea?  
PARSONS: Oh, thanks.  
CHRONOTIS: Just put the kettle on.  
PARSONS: Er, Professor Chronotis, I don't know if you remember me. We met at a
faculty party a few weeks ago. It's Chris Parsons.  
CHRONOTIS: Oh yes, of course. Enjoy these faculty dos, do you?  
PARSONS: Well, you know, it's  
CHRONOTIS: A lot of boring old dons talking away at each other, who never
listen to a word anybody else says.  
PARSONS: No, well, you said that  
CHRONOTIS: Talk, talk, talk. Never listen.  
PARSONS: No, well, er, look, I hope I'm not taking up any of your valuable  
CHRONOTIS: Time? Oh no. When you get to my age, you'll find that time doesn't
matter too much. Not that I expect you'll get to my age.  
PARSONS: Oh, really?  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, yes. I remember talking to the last Master of College but one,
or was it the last Master but two? Could have been three.  
PARSONS: Three?  
CHRONOTIS: Yes, nice young chap. Died rather tragically at the age of oh. Run
over by a coach and pair.  
PARSONS: What was it you said to him?  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, I don't know. Long time ago, you know.  
PARSONS: Yes. Professor, when we met you were kind enough to say that if I
dropped round you would lend me some of your books on carbon dating.  
CHRONOTIS: Oh yes, of course. Happy to. Ah, there's the kettle.  
(Chronitis disappears into the kitchen.)  
PARSONS: Professor?  
CHRONOTIS: You'll find the books you want at the far end of this bookshelf.
Third shelf down.  
(He goes back into the kitchen.)  
PARSONS: Thanks.  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Or is it the second shelf down? Second, I think. Anyway, take
what you want. Milk?  
PARSONS: Oh, yes please.  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: One lump or two?  
PARSONS: Two please.  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Sugar?  
(Chronotis enters with two china cups of tea on a tray.)  
CHRONOTIS: Ah, Here we are.  
(Parsons tucks his three selected books under his arm and looks at his wrist
watch.)  
PARSONS: Oh, actually Professor, I've just realised I'm going to be really
late for a seminar. Look, I'm terribly sorry. Look, I'll bring these back to
you next week, all right?  
CHRONOTIS: Yes, of course. Goodbye.  
(Chronotis takes his newly purchased slim paperback out of its plastic bag.)  
PARSONS: Goodbye. Actually, Professor, could I just ask you, where did you get
that?  
(He points to the Tardis.)  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, I don't know. I think someone must have left it there when I
was out.  
PARSONS: Yes, well, I'll bring these back as soon as I can.  
(Parsons leaves. Chronotis settles down to read his Pan paperback copy of The
Time Machine by H G Wells.)

**[River Cam]**

(The Doctor is punting Romana along The Backs. She is reading a book.)  
DOCTOR: Wordsworth, Rutherford, Christopher Smart, Andrew Marvel, Judge
Jefferies, Owen Chadwick.  
ROMANA: Who?  
DOCTOR: Owen Chadwick. Oh, yes. Some of the greatest labourers in the history
of Earth have thought here.  
ROMANA: Newton, of course.  
DOCTOR: Oh, definitely Newton.  
ROMANA: For every action, there is a equal and opposite reaction.  
DOCTOR: That's right.  
ROMANA: So Newton invented punting.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. There was no limit to Isaac's genius.  
ROMANA: Isn't it wonderful how something so primitive can be so  
DOCTOR: Restful?  
ROMANA: No, simple. You just push in one direction and the boat goes in the
other. Oh, I do love the spring. All the leaves, the colours.  
DOCTOR: It's October.  
ROMANA: I thought that you said we were coming here for May week.  
DOCTOR: I did. May week's in June.  
ROMANA: I'm confused.  
DOCTOR: So was the Tardis.  
ROMANA: Oh, I do love the autumn. All the leaves, the colours.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, at least with something as simple as a punt nothing can go
wrong. No coordinates, no dimensional stabilisers, nothing. Just the water, a
punt, a strong pair of hands and the pole.  
(Whereupon the pole gets stuck in the mud of the riverbed and the Doctor has
to let it go. They drift on under a bridge.)  
ROMANA: The pole.  
DOCTOR: Er, I think it's about time that we go and see if the Professor is
back in his room. Ask me how.  
(The man from the spacestation watches them drift under the bridge. He has a
large carpet bag with him, and has acquired a large white hat and cloak to
complete a Renaissance look.)  
ROMANA: How?  
DOCTOR: For every reaction there is an opposite and equally different action.  
(The whisper of many voices is briefly heard before he walks away.)  
ROMANA: Did you just heard voices?  
DOCTOR: What?  
(The Doctor has found a paddle.)

**[Physics lab]**

(Parsons places one of the books on top of two others - Hypnosis And The Law
and Zaphod: My Stories. It slides off them onto the table. He opens it to
discover it is written in an alien script. The time on the clock flies back
and forth as he riffles through the pages, ending up where it started when he
closes the book. He sniffs the book, then feels the cover and opens it. But
when he reaches for a magnifying glass it snaps itself shut again. He tries
stabbing it with a scalpel, but it moves out of the way of the blade.)

**[St Cedd's College]**

DOCTOR: (still carrying the paddle) Here we are, St. Cedd's College,
Cambridge. Founded in the year something or other, by someone someone in
honour of someone someone someone. In honour of someone who's name escapes me
completely.  
ROMANA: Saint Cedd?  
DOCTOR: Do you know I think you're very probably right. You should have been
an historian.  
ROMANA: I am an historian.  
(The Doctor goes over to the college porter, who is putting notices up on a
board on an easel.)  
DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Wilkin.  
(Yaroo, everybody. It's  Gerald Campion, the original TV Billy Bunter.)  
WILKIN: Good afternoon, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Wilkin! You remembered me.  
WILKIN: Why, yes, of course, sir. An honorary degree in 1960.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but how kind of you to remember me.  
WILKIN: That's my job, sir.  
DOCTOR: And you do it splendidly. Now  
WILKIN: Professor Chronotis, sir? He returned to his room a few minutes ago.  
DOCTOR: Oh good, good, good. Wilkin, how did you know I wanted to speak to
Professor Chronotis?  
WILKIN: Because that's who you asked for when you were here in 1964, 1960 and
1955, sir.  
DOCTOR: Did I really? I was here in 1958.  
WILKIN: Were you, sir?  
DOCTOR: Yes, but in a different body.  
WILKIN: (laughs) Yes, sir.  
ROMANA: Come along, Doctor.  
(The Doctor hands Wilkin the punt paddle.)  
DOCTOR: Nice to meet you, Wilkin. Bye, bye. (to Romana) Come on.

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(The Professor throws his book onto a table and gets up. There is a knock at
the door.)  
CHRONOTIS: Come in.  
(Chronotis goes into the kitchen. The Doctor and Romana enter.)  
DOCTOR: Come in. Over there. He'll ask us if we want tea.  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Tea?  
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Two cups.  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Milk?  
DOCTOR: Yes, please.  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: One lump or two?  
DOCTOR: Two please, and two sugars.  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Oh, Doctor.  
(Chronotis comes out with the tray.)  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, Doctor! How splendid to see you.  
DOCTOR: You too, Professor. This is Romana.  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, delighted, delighted. I've heard so much about you.  
DOCTOR: Have you really?  
CHRONOTIS: Well, not yet, but I will have done. When Time Lords get to my age
they tend to get their tenses muddled up. Would you liked some biscuits too?  
DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't have said no.  
CHRONOTIS: Crackers?  
DOCTOR: Oh, sometimes.  
(The spaceman walks through Cambridge with his whispering carpet bag. A little
later, tea and biscuits are being enjoyed.)  
ROMANA: Three hundred years?  
CHRONOTIS: Yes, my dear.  
ROMANA: And in the same set of rooms?  
CHRONOTIS: Ever since I retired from Gallifrey.  
ROMANA: Didn't anybody notice?  
CHRONOTIS: One of the delights of the older Cambridge colleges. Everyone is so
discreet. Now Doctor, young fellow, what can I do for you?  
DOCTOR: What can you do for me? You mean what can I do for you? You sent for
me.  
CHRONOTIS: Sent for you?  
DOCTOR: Yes, we got your signal.  
CHRONOTIS: Signal? What signal?  
DOCTOR: Romana, didn't we get a signal from the Professor, would we come as
soon as possible?  
ROMANA: Yes. We come straight away.  
CHRONOTIS: I never sent you a signal, but it's very splendid to see you. Have
another cracker.  
DOCTOR: I will. Professor, if you didn't send a signal, who did, hmm?

**[St Cedd's College]**

(The spaceman marches through the arch and calls to the porter without looking
at him.)  
SKAGRA: You! You!  
(Wilkin finishes putting a notice on the board and walks over.)  
WILKIN: Were you addressing me?  
SKAGRA: I want Chronotis.  
WILKIN: Professor Chronotis.  
SKAGRA: Where is he?  
WILKIN: He will not wish to be disturbed. He is with the Doctor. A very old, a
very old friend.  
(Skagra leaves the college.)

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(More tea is about to be poured.)  
CHRONOTIS: Wait.  
ROMANA: What for?  
CHRONOTIS: I've had an idea who sent that message.  
ROMANA: Who?  
CHRONOTIS: Me.  
DOCTOR: I thought you said you didn't.  
CHRONOTIS: Yes, I know. Memory's getting a bit touchy of late. Doesn't like to
be prodded about too much. But my dear old things, it must be ages since I
send it.  
ROMANA: I told you you'd got the time wrong, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but you're always saying that.  
ROMANA: You're always getting the time wrong.  
DOCTOR: Professor?  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Yes?  
DOCTOR: What was it about, Professor?  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: What was what about?  
DOCTOR: The message?  
(Chronotis comes out of the kitchen with a fresh pot of tea.)  
CHRONOTIS: I don't know. You've seen it more recently than I have.  
DOCTOR: Was it to do with the voices?  
CHRONOTIS: What voices?  
DOCTOR: Well, when I was on the river I heard a strange babble of inhuman
voices, didn't you, Romana?  
ROMANA: Yes.  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, undergraduates talking to each other, I expect. I've trying to
have it banned.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. It wasn't like that at all. It was the sound of
humans, or, or ghosts, very quietly  
ROMANA: Screaming.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
CHRONOTIS: Overwrought imaginings, Doctor. No, I remember what it was.  
DOCTOR: What?  
CHRONOTIS: Delicate matter, slightly. It, it was about a book.

**[Physics lab]**

(Parsons frowns at the book and puts it into a x-ray scanner compartment set
into the wall. The scanner explodes. The book is too hot to touch, but
otherwise intact. Parsons leave it alone, and it starts to glow and wibble
slightly.)

**[Cambridge]**

(Skagra walks down St Edwards Passage and comes out between a clothiers and a
camera shop, where a car is parked. He looks through the shop window until the
driver leaves the shop and returns to his car, then approaches him.)  
SKAGRA: I say.  
MAN: Yes? Can I help you?  
SKAGRA: Yes, perhaps you can.  
(We don't hear the conversation, but the man lets Skagra get into the car with
him and they drive away. Suddenly the car screeches to a halt in the middle of
King's Parade. We next see it driving past St Cedd's with Skagra in the
driving seat.)  

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(Chronotis is handing Romana a pile of books when he stops.)  
CHRONOTIS: Did you just hear voices?  
DOCTOR: Professor, I think that. I just heard voices. Romana, did you just
hear voices?  
ROMANA: Yes, very faint this time.  
DOCTOR: Anything to do with that book, Professor?  
CHRONOTIS: What? Oh, no, no, no. That's just a book I accidentally bought back
with me from Gallifrey.  
ROMANA: From Gallifrey? You brought a book from Gallifrey to Cambridge?  
CHRONOTIS: Well, just a few knick-knacks. You know how I love my books,
Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Professor, you said you brought it back by accident.  
CHRONOTIS: An oversight. I overlooked the fact that I had decided to bring it.
Just for study, you know. And as I'm now getting very old...  
DOCTOR: You thought that perhaps I'd take it straight back to Gallifrey for
you.  
CHRONOTIS: Well, as I'm retired, I'm not allowed to have a Tardis.  
DOCTOR: Professor, I don't want to be critical but I will. It's very risky
bringing books back from Gallifrey.  
CHRONOTIS: Is it?  
DOCTOR: I mean, they could be so dangerous in the wrong hands, hmm?

**[Telephone box]**

PARSONS: Clare, hi. Yes, it's me. What? Yes, I'm fine. Listen, the most
amazing... Well, just stop being busy. This is important. There's this book,
and it's got a molecular structure unlike anything I've ever seen before. Yes,
I said book. It's like nothing on Earth. Extraterrestrial. No, I'm not mad.
Listen, I've done everything. X-rays, microscope, you name it. Look, you don't
have to believe everything till you've seen it yourself. Yeah, come on over.
No, not in two hours. Now. Great.

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

DOCTOR: (reads) On some nights, New York was as hot as Bangkok. (The Victim.)
I've read that.  
ROMANA: Hmm. Saul Bellow.  
DOCTOR: Once upon a time. Read that. And ah. Ah ha. And in the ancient days of
Rassilon, five great principles were laid down. Can you remember what they
were, my children?  
ROMANA: It's just a Gallifreyan Nursery Book.  
DOCTOR: I know it is. It's very good.  
ROMANA: I had it when I was a Time tot.  
DOCTOR: Yes, it is good.  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, that's just a memento. Not the right book at all. Where is it?
Is this the one? Oh dear, no. No, I know it's here somewhere.  
DOCTOR: Professor? Professor? How many books did you bring back, for heaven's
sake?  
CHRONOTIS: Just the odd two or seven, but there was only one that was in any
way  
DOCTOR: Dangerous?  
(Skagra drives through Grantchester and parks the car before walking through a
gate into a large field. Then he walks up an invisible ramp and disappears
into the belly of an invisible spaceship.)  
ROMANA: What does it look like? What's it called?  
CHRONOTIS: The Worshipful And Ancient Law Of Gallifrey.  
(The Doctor drops the large old tome he is holding.)  
DOCTOR: The Worshipful And Ancient Law Of Gallifrey?  
CHRONOTIS: Yes. Red book, about five by seven.  
DOCTOR: Professor, how did that book get out of the Panopticon Archives?  
CHRONOTIS: Well, what I did you see was I, I just took it.  
DOCTOR: Took it?  
CHRONOTIS: Yes. There's no one interested in ancient history on Gallifrey any
longer, and I thought that certain things would be safer with me.  
DOCTOR: And were they?  
CHRONOTIS: Yes, in principle.  
DOCTOR: Excuse me. Delicate matter, Professor, slightly.  
(The Doctor lifts Chronotis down off his library steps.)  
DOCTOR: That book dates back to the days of Rassilon.  
CHRONOTIS: Does it? Yes, indeed.  
DOCTOR: It's one of the artefacts.  
CHRONOTIS: Is it, indeed.  
DOCTOR: Professor, you know that perfectly well. Rassilon had powers and
secrets that even we don't fully understand. You've no idea what might have
been hidden in that book.  
CHRONOTIS: Well, there's no chance of anyone else understanding it then, is
there?  
DOCTOR: I only hope you're right, but we'd better find it. Romana?  
ROMANA: Yes?  
DOCTOR: Little red book.  
ROMANA: Five by seven.  
DOCTOR: Good, good.  
CHRONOTIS: Could be green.

**[Spacecraft]**

SKAGRA: I have confirmed the location of the book. It shall soon be mine.  
SHIP: Congratulations, my lord.  
SKAGRA: Tell me of the one called the Doctor.  
(The screen shows various clips from different episodes, ending with punting
on the Backs.  
SKAGRA: He has no more power than the others. Only one has the power I need.
And when I have the book, that power shall be mine. Get me the carrier ship.  
(The clips of the Doctor are replaced by the outline of a shape.)  
SKAGRA: I shall be with you very soon, and then let the universe prepare
itself.

__**Part Two**__

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(The book search comes to an end.)  
ROMANA: Roget's Thesaurus.  
DOCTOR: British Book of Bird Life, in colour.  
ROMANA: Alternative Betelgeuse.  
DOCTOR: Time Machine.  
ROMANA: Wuthering Heights.  
DOCTOR: (reads) Tandoori Chicken for starters?  
ROMANA: Sweeney Todd.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but there's no sign of the Worshipful and Ancient Law of
Gallifrey.  
ROMANA: Do you really think it's important?  
DOCTOR: Of course it is. It's one of the artefacts.  
ROMANA: Other than its historical value.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Each of the artefacts was imbued with stupendous power. The
meaning of most of them has been lost by now, but the powers remain, and the
rituals.  
ROMANA: I just mouthed the words like everybody else.  
DOCTOR: What words?  
ROMANA: At the Time Academy Induction Ceremony. You know, I swear to protect
the ancient law of Gallifrey with all my might and main, and will to the end
of my days with justice and with honour temper my actions and my thoughts.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Pompous lot. All words and no actions.  
ROMANA: Well, that's not true. What about Salyavin?  
DOCTOR: Salyavin?  
ROMANA: Mmm.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, Salyavin. He was a boyhood hero of mine.  
ROMANA: Really, Doctor? A great criminal your hero?  
DOCTOR: Well, a criminal, yes, but he had such style, such flair, such  
ROMANA: Panache?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. He was a bit like me in that respect.  
ROMANA: Did you ever meet him?  
DOCTOR: I certainly did not!  
ROMANA: All right.  
DOCTOR: He was imprisoned before I was born.  
ROMANA: Where?  
DOCTOR: On... Do you know, I can't remember. Professor?  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Yes?  
DOCTOR: Salyavin. He was a contemporary of yours, wasn't he? Where was he
imprisoned?  
(Chronotis runs in from the kitchen.)  
CHRONOTIS: I've just remembered.  
DOCTOR: I've only just asked you.  
CHRONOTIS: What?  
DOCTOR: Where Salyavin was imprisoned..  
CHRONOTIS: Salyavin? I'm not talking about Salyavin. Good riddance to him. We
must find the book.  
DOCTOR: Professor, what do you think we're doing?  
CHRONOTIS: I just remembered.  
DOCTOR: What?  
CHRONOTIS: There was a young man here earlier. Came to borrow some books. He
might have taken it while I was out in the kitchen making tea.  
DOCTOR: What was his name, Professor? What was his name?  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, if only I could remember. Oh dear, I've got a memory like a. Oh
dear, what is it I've got a memory like? What's that thing you strain rice
with?  
DOCTOR: What was his name, Professor?  
ROMANA: Was he old? Young? Tall? Short?  
CHRONOTIS: I remember!  
DOCTOR: What?  
CHRONOTIS: A sieve! That's what it is. I've got a memory like a sieve.  
DOCTOR: Professor, what was his name?  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, I can't remember his name.  
ROMANA: Oh, do please try.  
CHRONOTIS: A. A. No, it doesn't begin with A. B? B? B? BB  
DOCTOR + ROMANA: C?  
CHRONOTIS: D?

**[Physics lab]**

(Clare lowers the book.)  
CLARE: What's it called?  
PARSONS: Called? How should I know? Keightley, this book.  
CLARE: Clare.  
PARSONS: This book will do for science what the Japanese did to Pearl Harbour.  
CLARE: What, bomb it?  
PARSONS: What?  
CLARE: Feels like paper, it smells like paper, doesn't behave like paper.
Plastic.  
PARSONS: Not a single polymer in sight.  
CLAIRE: Metal?  
PARSONS: No crystalline structure.  
CLARE: A single crystal, then.  
PARSONS: Well, if it is, our mystery Don's got a lot of explaining to do. Half
of it's stable all of the time, half of it none of the time. There's
absolutely no way of telling what it's made of.  
CLARE: X-ray tomography.  
PARSONS: Oh yeah, I got a positive result on the x-ray.  
CLARE: What?  
PARSONS: It blew up. Not only can't I tell what the structure is, it actually
doesn't seem to have a structure. Pure matter. Non-atomic matter.  
CLARE: You can't have matter without atomic structure. It's fundamental.  
PARSONS: I can't explain it.  
CLARE: What's it about?  
PARSONS: What?  
CLARE: The book, Chris. What is it about?  
PARSONS: Well, I don't know, do I? It reads like a cross between Chinese and
algebra.  
CLARE: Why don't you ask old What's-his-name?  
PARSONS: Chronotis? Well, yes, that's the obvious thing to do, I suppose.  
CLARE: Is that why you haven't done it yet?  
PARSONS: Make yourself at home, Keightley. (leaves)  
CLARE: It's Clare.

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

CHRONOTIS: P. Q. R. X! X! Y?  
DOCTOR: Young!  
CHRONOTIS: Yes! Young Parsons. Born 1956, graduated 1978, honours degree in
chemistry. Currently engaged in sigma particles.  
DOCTOR: Where would he be now, Professor?  
CHRONOTIS: Physics Lab, I should think. First left!  
(Chronotis goes into the kitchen.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I'll be back in two minutes. (to Romana) If I'm not back in
two hours, you and the Professor lock yourselves in the Tardis, send out an
all-frequency alert, and wait. Wait!  
ROMANA: Right.  
(The Doctor leaves.)  
CHRONOTIS: More tea, my dear?  
ROMANA: Lovely. Two lumps, no sugar.

(Skagra leaves his invisible spaceship wearing the clothes of the car driver
and carrying his carpet bag. The Doctor has appropriated some poor student's
bicycle, and pedals through the streets to the accompaniment of squealing car
brakes. Parsons is also bicycling back to the college, and nearly collides
with the Doctor at the junction of Botolph Lane and Trumpington Street.)

**[St Cedd's College]**

(Skagra meets Wilkin walking through a quad.)  
SKAGRA: Is the Professor alone now?  
WILKIN: Oh yes, sir. The Doctor left a few minutes ago.

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(Romana is toasting muffins on Chronotis' electric fire.)  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, dear.  
ROMANA: What's the matter?  
CHRONOTIS: We've run out of milk.  
ROMANA: Oh, I should think that's the least of our problems.  
CHRONOTIS: I do feel so stupid losing that book.  
ROMANA: Don't worry, we'll find it.  
CHRONOTIS: I hope so. I do hope so.  
ROMANA: Brr.  
CHRONOTIS: You're shivering. Are you cold?  
ROMANA: No, it's just a feeling. Those voices unnerved me.  
CHRONOTIS: A cup of hot tea will do you good. Ah, no milk. I'll just pop out
and get some.  
ROMANA: I don't think that's a very awfully good idea, Professor.  
CHRONOTIS: Why not? It's the only way I know of getting milk, short of having
a cow.  
ROMANA: We've got plenty.  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, splendid. Type Forty, isn't it? Yes, came out when I was a boy.
That shows you how old I am.  
ROMANA: I shan't be a moment.  
CHRONOTIS: Oh yes, you will. The kitchens are too far from the control
chamber.  
ROMANA: I've never known the Doctor use them anyway.  
(Romana goes into the Tardis.)  
CHRONOTIS: Salyavin! Good riddance to him, Salyavin. Good riddance. Bah.
Undergraduates.  
(There is a knock on the door.)  
CHRONOTIS: Come in!  
(Chronotis goes to the kitchen as Skagra enters.)  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Only got lemon tea, I'm afraid. No milk. The girl's gone out
to get some.  
(The voices fill the room.)  
CHRONOTIS [OC]: How many of there are you, for heaven sake? I've only got
seven cups.  
(Chronotis enters with seven cups on a tray.)  
SKAGRA: Professor Chronotis?  
CHRONOTIS: Where are the others?  
SKAGRA: Professor Chronotis.  
CHRONOTIS: Who are you?  
SKAGRA: I have come for the book.  
CHRONOTIS: Book? What book?  
SKAGRA: You know what book.  
CHRONOTIS: I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't got any books.
That's to say, I've got plenty of books. What book would you like?  
SKAGRA: The book you took from the Panopticon Archives.  
CHRONOTIS: What do you know about the Panopticon?  
SKAGRA: The book, Professor. You are to give it to me.  
CHRONOTIS: On whose instructions?  
SKAGRA: Mine, Professor.  
CHRONOTIS: Who are you?  
SKAGRA: My name does not concern you. Give me the book.  
CHRONOTIS: I don't know where it is.  
SKAGRA: If you will not give me the information voluntarily, I will deduct it
from you. I'm sure there is much else in your mind that will interest me.  
CHRONOTIS: Oh! No! No! (The sphere rises out of the carpet bag and fastens
itself to Chronotis' forehead. His arms flail in pain and he falls to his
knees.)  
SKAGRA: Do not fight it, Professor. Do not fight it, or you will die.

**[Physics lab]**

(Clare is repairing the x-ray machine when she notices the shadow of someone
entering.)  
CLARE: Hello.  
DOCTOR: Oh, hello.  
CLARE: You've just missed him, I'm afraid.  
DOCTOR: Sorry?  
CLARE: Chris Parsons? You've just missed him. Can I give him a message?  
DOCTOR: (pointing at the book) This isn't yours.  
CLARE: Er, no. Is it yours?  
DOCTOR: It belongs to some friends of mine.  
CLARE: Odd book.  
DOCTOR: Odd friends. And careless. Oddly careless. Why did you take it? CLARE:
I didn't.  
DOCTOR: I know.  
CLARE: Look, what is this all about?  
DOCTOR: What's what about?  
CLARE: This book.  
DOCTOR: Have you read it?  
CLARE: No, I can't.  
DOCTOR: What, can't read?  
CLARE: No. I mean yes. I can read. I  
(The Doctor puts the book to his ear.)  
CLARE: Where does it come from, what is it made of, and why did it make the
x-ray machine explode?  
DOCTOR: It did that? CLARE: Yes.  
(He puts the book down.)  
DOCTOR: Hello, I'm the Doctor. And you?  
CLARE: Clare. Clare Keightley.  
DOCTOR: Clare Clare Keightley, can I have a look at your x-ray machine?

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(Skagra has gone, and Chronotis is lying on the floor when Romana comes out of
the Tardis.)  
ROMANA: I've got the milk. Professor?  
K9: Coming, Mistress.  
ROMANA: Professor!  
(Romana checks Chronotis' vital signs, then there is a knock at the door.)  
ROMANA: Who is it?  
(Parsons enters.)  
PARSONS: It's me, Professor. I just came back to... What's happened? Is he all
right?  
ROMANA: I don't know. I think he's dead.  
K9: Negative, mistress. He is alive but he's in a deep coma.  
PARSONS: What's happened to him?  
K9: Processing data.  
ROMANA: Do you know him?  
PARSONS: Hardly at all. He just lent me a book.  
ROMANA: A book? We've been looking for a book. Chris Parsons?  
PARSONS: Chris Parsons, yes.  
ROMANA: Have you got it?  
PARSONS: No. I left it back at the lab. You see I couldn't under  
ROMANA: Isn't the Doctor with you?  
PARSONS: Well, how would I know? I mean, how would I know the Professor was
ill?  
ROMANA: No, no, no. The Doctor.  
PARSONS: What?  
K9: Mistress, the Professor has been subjected to psychoactive extraction.  
ROMANA: Will he be all right?  
K9: Physical prognosis fair, psycho prognosis uncertain.  
PARSONS: It's a robot!  
ROMANA: Of course.  
PARSONS: A robot dog.  
ROMANA: Yes.  
PARSONS: Neat.  
ROMANA: K9, did you said psychoactive extraction?  
K9: Affirmative, mistress. Someone has stolen part of his mind.  
PARSONS: What did your dog say?  
K9: Someone has stolen part of his mind. His attempts to resist have caused
severe cerebral trauma. He is weakening fast.  
PARSONS: Is this all for real?  
ROMANA: Do you want to make yourself useful?  
PARSONS: Well, if I can.  
ROMANA: Go and get the medical kit from the Tardis.  
PARSONS: The what?  
ROMANA: Over there. First door on the left, down the corridor, second door on
the right, down the corridor, third door on the left, down the corridor,
fourth door on the right  
PARSONS: Down the corridor?  
ROMANA: No, white cupboard opposite the door, top shelf.  
PARSONS: For a minute I thought you were pointing at that police box.  
ROMANA: I was.  
PARSONS: But  
ROMANA: Please get it.  
(Parsons enters the Tardis and immediately comes out again.)  
PARSONS: But  
ROMANA: Hurry up!  
(Parsons goes back into the Tardis. Romana uses books to make a pillow for
Chronotis.)  
ROMANA: Professor, can you hear me? Professor? Professor?  
K9: Mistress, his mind has gone.  
ROMANA: You just said part of it, K9.  
K9: Affirmative. The part that is left is totally inert.  
ROMANA: Professor!  
K9: No response, mistress.  
(Parsons comes out of the Tardis, out of breath, carrying a tool bag.)  
ROMANA: Thank you.  
(Romana fits a collar with a large circular piece on it around Chronotis'
neck. It starts flashing green.)  
PARSONS: What are you doing to him?  
ROMANA: He's breathing and his hearts are beating, so his autonomic brain is
functioning. This collar will take over those functions and leave his
autonomic brain free.  
PARSONS: What good'll that do?  
ROMANA: He should be able to think with it.  
PARSONS: Think with his autonomic brain? Don't be silly. The human brain
doesn't work like that. The different function are separated by  
ROMANA: The Professor isn't human.  
PARSONS: Ah.

**[Physics lab]**

CLARE: It had no detectable atomic structure.  
DOCTOR: Well, the book must have stored up vast amounts of subatomic energy
and suddenly it released it when the machine was activated. Does anything
strike you about that?  
CLARE: What?  
DOCTOR: It's a very strange way for a book to behave.  
CLARE: I would have thought that was obvious.  
DOCTOR: Never underestimate the obvious.  
CLARE: But what does it tell us?  
DOCTOR: Nothing, obviously.  
CLARE: Well?  
DOCTOR: So obviously it was meant to tell us nothing. Exactly the opposite
function of a book. Therefore  
CLARE: It isn't a book. Then what is it?  
(A printer rattles.)  
DOCTOR: What was that?  
CLARE: Oh, should be the results of the carbon dating test I ran. (tears off
printout) It's twenty thousand years old, Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Look at that.  
CLARE: A minus sign? Minus twenty thousand years?  
DOCTOR: Not only is this book not a book, but time is running backwards for
it. I think I'd better return it as soon as possible, don't you?

**[Spacecraft]**

(Skagra snaps his fingers and summons the floating ball.)  
SKAGRA: Playback.  
SKAGRA [on screen]: The book, Professor.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Was as hot as Bangkok. Once upon a time.  
SKAGRA: Trace memories.  
(Chris Parsons muttering something.)

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

ROMANA: The collar's functioning. K9, is there any trace of conscious thought?  
K9: Processing data, mistress. Far too early to tell.  
PARSONS: Good.  
ROMANA: What do you mean, good?  
PARSONS: Well, don't you see? When one works as a scientist, one doesn't
always know where one's going, or that there is anywhere for one to go. That
there aren't going to be big doors that stay permanently shut to one. But I
look at all this, marvellous, and I know that a lot things that seem
impossible are possible, so good. I take it that you...  
ROMANA: Romana.  
PARSONS: No, I mean that you're not from Earth.  
K9: Mistress, the Professor's condition is rapidly deteriorating.  
ROMANA: Isn't there anything we can do?  
K9: Negative, mistress. The condition is terminal.  
ROMANA: But is he thinking? Can he hear us?  
K9: Minimal cerebral impulses detectable, mistress.  
ROMANA: Can he talk?  
K9: Negative. The speech centres of the brain are completely inoperative.  
PARSONS: Well, your collar was a nice idea but  
ROMANA: Shush.  
PARSONS: What?  
ROMANA: Wait a minute. K9, can you amplify his heart beat?  
K9: Affirmative, mistress.  
(Two irregular heartbeats are heard.)  
ROMANA: Brilliant!  
PARSONS: What?  
ROMANA: The Professor is a brave and clever man. Listen.  
PARSONS: I don't understand.  
ROMANA: He's beating his heart in Gallifreyan Morse. Professor, I can hear
you. What do you want to tell us?  
(Thumpity thumpity.)  
ROMANA: Beware. The. Sphere. Beware. Skagra. Beware. Shada. The. Secret. Is.
In. The  
(Silence.)  
K9: He is dying, mistress.  
ROMANA: Professor!  
K9: All life function has now ceased, mistress. The Professor is dead.

**[Bridge]**

(The Doctor is bicycling back to the College when he meets Skagra on a bridge,
holding the sphere.)  
SKAGRA: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
SKAGRA: I am Skagra. I want the book.  
DOCTOR: Well, I'm the Doctor and you can't have it.  
SKAGRA: You attempt to hide it from me?  
DOCTOR: Yes. It'll be taken to a place of safety.  
SKAGRA: Where?  
DOCTOR: Oh, a little place I have in mind.  
SKAGRA: Doctor, you will give to me everything that you have in your mind.
Your mind shall be mine.  
DOCTOR: I'm not mad about your tailor.  
(The sphere floats towards the Doctor. He ducks under it and pedals off with
it in pursuit.)

**[Cambridge]**

(An a capella group are singing 'Chattanooga Choo Choo as the Doctor pedals
past, ringing his bell at just the right moment in the song. The sphere floats
past them unnoticed. The Doctor continues through the back streets and
alleyways and on one sharp corner the book flies out of the basket. He turns
down an alley with a No Cycling notice and keeps going. Skagra finds the book.
The Doctor props the bicycle up by another No Cycling sign.)  
DOCTOR: I beg your pardon.  
(He runs along Kings Parade then down an alley as the sphere arrives at the
bicycle. It pauses, then continues, knocking over a pedestrian in the street
before finding the Doctor trapped at the back of row of shops. He tries to
climb over a set of locked metal gates topped with barbed wire, but the mesh
is too small to get a foothold, so he falls to the ground to try and wriggle
underneath. The sphere approaches his head.)

__**Part Three**__

**[Cambridge]**

(The Tardis materialises nearby and the sphere retreats.)  
ROMANA: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
ROMANA: Shush. Hurry!  
DOCTOR: Coming.  
(The Doctor runs into the Tardis and it dematerialises with his scarf trapped
in the doors.)

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(Parsons bends over Chronotis, who vanishes.)  
PARSONS: Professor.  
(The Tardis materialises, without the trapped scarf.)  
DOCTOR: Who are you?  
PARSONS: Chris Parsons, Bristol Grammar School and Johns.  
DOCTOR: Never heard of you. You're the one causing all the trouble.  
PARSONS: Me? Well, where's the book?  
DOCTOR: Where's the Professor?  
PARSONS: Well, he just, just, just  
DOCTOR: He just what?  
PARSONS: Well, I just don't know. His body just disappeared into thin air.  
DOCTOR: Where was the body?  
PARSONS: There. It disappeared just before you arrived.  
DOCTOR: Here?  
PARSONS: Yes.  
DOCTOR: It's gone. He must have been on his very last regeneration. Did you
say someone had stolen his mind?  
ROMANA: Yes.  
DOCTOR: That's funny. Skagra threatened to do that to me too.  
ROMANA: Skagra?  
DOCTOR: You know the name?  
PARSONS: Just before the Professor died, he said three things.  
DOCTOR: What?  
PARSONS: Beware the sphere, beware Skagra.  
ROMANA: And beware Shada.  
DOCTOR: Shada?  
ROMANA: Do you know the name?  
DOCTOR: Shada. No. You?  
PARSONS: Doesn't mean anything to me.  
DOCTOR: Well, Mister Skagra, or whatever it is you call yourself, you've
killed a Time Lord and a very old friend of mine. It's time you and I had a
little chat. K9!  
K9: Master?  
DOCTOR: K9, can you find any trace of that sphere?  
K9: Affirmative, Master, but it is far, far too weak to take a bearing.  
DOCTOR: We'll have to wait till it's active again. Now listen, K9, the moment
the signal becomes clear  
K9: Affirmative, Master.  
DOCTOR: Good, good. Right, we'll wait in the Tardis.  
ROMANA: Excellent thought.  
DOCTOR: Come on. You too, Bristol.

(By the river, in the pouring rain, an innocent fisherman gets his mind stolen
by the sphere. He falls into the water where he presumably drowns.)

**[Outside Chronotis' rooms]**

(Clare knocks on the door, which has lots of notices stuck to it.)  
CLARE: Hello?

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(The Tardis dematerialises. Clare enters.)  
CLARE: Hello?

**[Field]**

(The Tardis materialises, and the Doctor, Parsons and Romana come out just in
time to see -)  
DOCTOR: There it is.  
(The sphere disappear into the invisible spaceship.)  
DOCTOR: Did you just see what I didn't see?  
ROMANA: No.  
DOCTOR: Neither did I.  
PARSONS: It just vanished.  
DOCTOR: That's what I said. Watch that cow pat.  
ROMANA: Come on, K9.  
K9 [OC]: Coming, mistress.

**[Spacecraft]**

(Skagra is sitting cross-legged, with the book open in front of him, when the
sphere starts beeping.)  
SKAGRA: Report.  
(A clip of the Doctor and Romana escaping into the Tardis.)  
SKAGRA: Continue.  
(It shows the Tardis dematerialising.)  
SKAGRA: What is that machine?  
SHIP: It displays the characteristics of a Gallifreyan time capsule, my lord.
Type 39, possibly type 40.  
(The display says - traces of artron energy, type 39/40, status: Obsolete.)  
SKAGRA: Present whereabouts?  
SHIP: It is currently in close proximity, my lord. Warning, my lord. Intruders
are approaching the ship.  
SKAGRA: Show me.  
(The screen shows the group walking across the field. The book glows briefly.)  
SKAGRA: Admit them.

**[Field]**

(The Doctor bumps into the spaceship with his nose.)  
DOCTOR: Ow! Don't move.  
(Every touch gives out an electric crackle and a hollow boom as the Doctor
feels along the side of the invisible object.)  
DOCTOR: K9, there's something here.  
K9: Affirmative, Master.  
DOCTOR: Then why didn't you tell me, you stupid animal?  
K9: I assumed you could see it, master.  
ROMANA: What is it, K9?  
K9: A spacecraft, mistress, of very advanced design. Many of its functions are
beyond my capacity to analyse.  
PARSONS: If I built something that clever I'd want people to see it.  
DOCTOR: Shush. K9, what's it powered by?  
K9: Insufficient data.  
DOCTOR: Aren't we all? Where does it come from?  
K9: Insufficient data.  
ROMANA: What does it look like?  
K9: Very large, mistress.  
DOCTOR: How large?  
K9: One hundred metres long.  
DOCTOR: One hundred metres? That should keep the cows guessing. Hmm. There
must be an entrance somewhere.  
PARSONS: What's that carpet doing there?  
DOCTOR: Got to be an entrance. What's that carpet doing here?  
(A piece of red carpet is lying on the grass. Our trio reach the carpet, and
the Doctor trips over something. There is a whirring sound as the ramp is
lowered.)  
K9: A door is opening, Master.  
DOCTOR: Affirmative, K9, affirmative.  
(The Doctor walks up the ramp followed by Romana and, after a little
hesitation, Parsons.)  
DOCTOR: Come along, K9, heel.  
ROMANA: Affirmative, master.

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

CLARE: Chris? Chris Parsons? Professor Chronotis?  
(Clare finds Parsons' satchel, and looks inside.)  
CLARE: Chris?  
(She looks at one of the books that was Chronotis' pillow, makes a decision
and leaves quickly.)

**[Spacecraft corridor]**

PARSONS: Better than an old police box.  
DOCTOR: K9, any sign of that deranged billiard ball?  
K9: Master?  
DOCTOR: The gagglebat, the beastie.  
ROMANA: The sphere, K9.  
K9: Negative, mistress.  
DOCTOR: Romana, I'd feel much happier if you three waited outside. No point in
all of us walking into the spider's web.  
ROMANA: I'll stay. You might need help.  
PARSONS: Well, if it's... Er, okay.  
DOCTOR: I wonder if  
(But a cube has appeared behind the Doctor and made his companions vanish.)  
DOCTOR: Romana?  
(Skagra enters the corridor behind him.)  
SKAGRA: They will not be harmed, Doctor. For the moment. These small party
tricks are purely functional. Their purpose is precisely defined, as is mine.  
DOCTOR: Where have you taken them?  
SKAGRA: Come with me.

**[Spacecraft]**

(Skagra places his hand on the sphere.)  
DOCTOR: Skagra, what have you done with the Professor's mind?  
SKAGRA: It is to be put to a more useful purpose.  
DOCTOR: It was serving a perfectly useful purpose where it was.  
SKAGRA: Not to me.  
DOCTOR: You realise he died.  
SKAGRA: Only his mind was of use to me, not his life.  
DOCTOR: You take a very proprietorial attitude to other people's brains.  
SKAGRA: It seems to me that the Time Lords take a very proprietorial view of
the universe.  
DOCTOR: Just exactly who are you, Skagra?  
SKAGRA: That knowledge will be of no use to you.  
DOCTOR: Then you may as well tell me.  
SKAGRA: I may as well not. Besides, we have other matters to discuss. This
book, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Which book? This book?  
(Skagra hands it to the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, I've read it. It's rubbish.  
(Skagra takes it back.)  
SKAGRA: Then perhaps you'd be good enough to read it to me.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I have a very monotonous reading voice. Really, by the time I'd
got to the bottom of the first page you'd be asleep and I'd escape, and then
where would you be?  
SKAGRA: Read it to me.  
DOCTOR: I presume you can't read Gallifreyan, then.  
SKAGRA: Like a native. Read it.  
DOCTOR: All right. Are you standing comfortably?  
SKAGRA: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Then I'll sit down.  
SKAGRA: Begin.  
(The sphere hovers by the Doctor's head.)  
DOCTOR: (unintelligible alien words) I'm paraphrasing, of course.  
SKAGRA: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush. You'll like this bit. This is a good bit. (more
silly sounds) Skagra, do you realise this book doesn't make one bit of sense.  
SKAGRA: A fool would realise it was written in code.  
DOCTOR: Skagra, this thing is written in code. How am I doing?  
SKAGRA: I believe you know the code.  
DOCTOR: Who, me?  
SKAGRA: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. I'm afraid I'm very stupid. Very stupid. I'm very, very
stupid.  
SKAGRA: Doctor, I believe you, as a Time Lord, know this code, and you will
give that knowledge to me.  
DOCTOR: There's no point in giving me orders. I'm very stupid.  
SKAGRA: It was not an order.  
DOCTOR: It wasn't?  
SKAGRA: It was a statement of fact.  
DOCTOR: Ah. How stupid of me.  
SKAGRA: You have no choice. You will give that knowledge to me.  
DOCTOR: Ah, well, I don't know about that. I don't know about anything. In
fact I'm really an appallingly stupid creature. (laughs)  
SKAGRA: You will be.  
(The sphere goes to the Doctor, who screams.)

**[Brig]**

(Romana, K9 and Parsons are in a small square room with no doors or windows.)  
PARSONS: There's no door. We must have got here by some sort of matter
transference.  
ROMANA: Very clever.  
PARSONS: Oh, I suppose you do this sort of thing the whole time.  
ROMANA: Yes, actually. K9, can't you pick up any trace of the Doctor?  
K9: Negative, mistress. Every signal is shielded.  
PARSONS: I was meant to be delivering a paper to the Astronomical Society
tonight.  
ROMANA: Oh, yes?  
(Romana makes adjustments to K9's innards.)  
ROMANA: Can you pick up anything now?  
K9: Negative, mistress.  
PARSONS: Yes, I finally disproved the possibility of life on other planets.  
ROMANA: Oh, yes?  
PARSONS: Well, I can deliver at next month's.  
ROMANA: Now try.  
PARSONS: Have to be a complete re-write though.  
K9: Triple negative.  
PARSONS: Curious substance, this wall.  
ROMANA: Oh, blast it.  
K9: Please duck.  
(K9 fires his laser, which ricochets several times.)  
K9: Apologies, mistress.  
ROMANA: Not at all.  
K9: The wall is blast proof.  
ROMANA: It was a good try, K9.  
K9: Mistress, I am now picking up faint signals.  
ROMANA: What is it? Can you let us hear it?  
K9: Affirmative, mistress.  
(It is the muttering voices.)  
PARSONS: Sounds different this time.  
K9: A new voice has been added.  
ROMANA: A new voice?  
K9: Affirmative. It is the Doctor.

**[St Cedd's College]**

(Clare runs out of the building and straight into Wilkin.)  
CLARE: Oh!  
WILKIN: Mind where you're going.  
CLARE: You don't know where Professor Chronotis has gone, do you?  
WILKIN: Calm down. Isn't he in his room?  
CLARE: No, I've just come from there.  
WILKIN: Well that's funny, he didn't come out this way. I'll tell you what. If
you'd like to leave a message, I'll see he gets it.  
CLARE: Well look, it's terribly urgent. A book a friend of mine was taking to
him, well, I think it's very dangerous.  
WILKIN: Well what I say is people shouldn't write things if they don't want
people to read them.  
CLARE: No, you don't understand. The book itself, it's atomically unstable. It
seems to be absorbing radioactivity. I think it's very, very dangerous.  
WILKIN: What, a book's doing that?  
CLARE: Yes. We must find the Professor.  
WILKIN: All right, Miss, I'll tell you what. You go back to his room and I'll
ring round the College and see if I can find out where he's got to.  
CLARE: Yes. But wait. Look, it's... All right, I'll go back.  
WILKIN: I don't know. Nowadays they'll publish anything.

**[Brig]**

ROMANA: Are you positive, K9? Absolutely negative?  
K9: Affirmative. No signals on any frequency, mistress.  
ROMANA: Oh, I wish I could get out of here.  
(The cube of light appears and Romana vanishes.)  
PARSONS: That's it!  
K9: Please explain.  
PARSONS: That's what you have to say. I wish we could get out of here. I wish
we could get out of here? Oh, I wish we could get out of here. Oh, blast. No!
No, no, no, no, K9. No. Good dog.

**[Field]**

(Skagra, back in his white suit, leads Romana down the ramp.)  
ROMANA: Where are you taking me? Where are you taking me?  
SKAGRA: Quiet! Or I'll use the sphere on you as well.  
(The sphere follows them down, and we hear the ramp close.)

**[Brig]**

PARSONS: How did she get out and not me?  
K9: Insufficient data.  
PARSONS: Insufficient data. Insufficient data? Oh, why did I ever let myself
get involved in this?  
K9: Insufficient data.

**[Field]**

ROMANA: Where are you taking me?  
SKAGRA: Your travelling capsule.  
ROMANA: If you think I'm going to open the door, you're going to be extremely
disappointed.  
SKAGRA: It's just as well I have the Doctor's key.  
(Skagra unlocks the Tardis and pushes Romana inside.)  
ROMANA: Ow!  
(Skagra follows, then the sphere. The key is still in the lock when the Tardis
dematerialises.)

**[Spacecraft]**

(The Doctor is lying on the deck by four acceleration couches. He wakes.)  
DOCTOR: Very stupid. Ha. Very stupid.  
(He gets up, feeling dizzy.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, very stupid. Skagra?  
SHIP: My lord has departed.  
DOCTOR: Who's that?  
SHIP: My lord Skagra.  
DOCTOR: No, who's speaking?  
SHIP: I am servant to Skagra. I am the ship.  
DOCTOR: The ship? A talking ship?  
SHIP: Correct.  
DOCTOR: Skagra must be hard up for friends. Will you tell me where my
companions are?  
SHIP: I will not. You are an enemy of Skagra. Any orders you give me are
hostile to my lord.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't mean any harm.  
SHIP: Why are you moving?  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry?  
SHIP: You're dead.  
DOCTOR: I am?  
SHIP: Your entire mind was drained by the sphere.  
DOCTOR: Oh, well, it wasn't, was it. The trick on those occasions is not to
resist. I just let the thing believe I was stupid so it didn't pull nearly
hard enough. It got a copy of my mind, but left me with the original, intact.
Understand?  
SHIP: No, I do not.  
DOCTOR: No more do I. Perhaps I really am stupid. No, got it! I know. I'm
dead.  
SHIP: That does compute to my lord's actions.  
DOCTOR: Ah, well, it must be true, then. Will you tell me where my companions
are now?  
SHIP: I cannot accept your orders. You are an enemy of Skagra.  
DOCTOR: An enemy? Me? Not true. If I'm dead, then I'm an ex-enemy of Skagra,
correct?  
SHIP: Correct.  
DOCTOR: And a dead man can hardly be a threat to anyone, correct?  
SHIP: Correct.  
DOCTOR: Then if I am dead, I can't possibly give orders that would be any kind
of threat to Skagra.  
SHIP: Correct.  
DOCTOR: Then will you please arrange the release of my companions?  
SHIP: I have orders not to. Their release would constitute a threat to Skagra.  
DOCTOR: But I'm ordering you to. And as we have established the fact that I am
dead, that I'm incapable of ordering anything that would threaten Skagra. So,
if I were to order you to release them, it can't threaten him. Will you
release them now?  
SHIP: They will be released.  
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. It's getting stuffy in here.  
SHIP: You are dead.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought we'd sorted that out.  
SHIP: I'm programmed to conserve resources. Since there are no live beings in
this area, I have shut down the oxygen supply.  
DOCTOR: What? Argh. (collapses)  
SHIP: Dead men do not require oxygen.

__**Part Four**__

**[Brig]**

(Parsons stops pacing and squats by K9.)  
PARSONS: Not a clue.  
(They are teleported away.)

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(Clare starts a not very thorough search of the room. She finds a old key on
the mantelpiece and uses it to unlock a cupboard underneath a bookcase. Behind
the old cricket pad and tennis racket is an array of dusty machinery. She
rests her hand on the bottom row of books and it turns round into a control
panel. Clare flicks a switch and some lights come on, then the curtains close.
She pulls a lever, there's a flash and she is thrown back across an occasional
table as the room shimmers. Outside, Wilkins enters the doorway from the
quad.)

**[Outside Chronotis' rooms]**

(Wilkin knocks on the door.)  
WILKIN: Miss? Are you in there, Miss?  
(Wilkin opens the door, but instead of the wood panelled rooms, a blue
shimmering light greets him.)

**[Spacecraft corridor]**

PARSONS: Hey, we did it.  
K9: Danger, Doctor. Danger.  
(K9 tried to laser open the door to the command deck, and fails. Parsons
presses the top button and the doors open.)

**[Spacecraft]**

PARSONS: Doctor!  
SHIP: Oxygen levels returning to normal.  
PARSONS: Who said that?  
SHIP: I am the ship, and the servant of my lord Skagra.  
PARSONS: Where's that voice coming from?  
K9: Master?  
PARSONS: Don't worry, K9. He's all right.  
DOCTOR: No, I'm not. I'm dead.  
PARSONS: Pardon?  
DOCTOR: I've been nearly too clever by three quarters.  
PARSONS: You never seem to do anything by halves.  
DOCTOR: I persuaded the ship that I was dead, and it cut off my oxygen supply.  
PARSONS: You what?  
DOCTOR: It won't take orders from an enemy of Skagra, but since it believes
I'm dead, since I am dead, the ship has no reason not to accept my orders.  
PARSONS: What?  
DOCTOR: It only resumed the oxygen supply when you came in. You're still
alive. Officially.  
PARSONS: That's reassuring.  
DOCTOR: Where's Romana?  
PARSONS: I thought she was with you. Whatever took us off, came back for her.  
(The Doctor throws his bag of jelly babies across the room.)  
DOCTOR: Skagra! He must suffer. K9, is the Tardis still where we left her
outside?  
K9: Negative, master.  
DOCTOR: What?

**[Command ship]**

(A big red and orange spaceship complete with landing deck. The Tardis
materialises inside. The sphere leads Skagra and Romana out into a corridor.)  
ROMANA: Where are we?  
SKAGRA: On my command ship.  
ROMANA: And what are you hoping to command?  
SKAGRA: More than you can possibly imagine.  
ROMANA: I have a very vivid imagination.  
SKAGRA: So have I.  
(Something approaches, viewing them through a red filter.)  
KRARG: Welcome back, my lord.

**[Spacecraft]**

(The Doctor is playing with his yo-yo.)  
PARSONS: So where's he taken your Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Or when.  
PARSONS: What?  
DOCTOR: Time machine.  
PARSONS: Ah, yes. He took Romana because she can operate it for him?  
DOCTOR: So can he. He's got a copy of my mind in that sphere of his.
Everything I know is at his disposal.  
PARSONS: Then why did he take her with him?  
DOCTOR: Well, probably wants someone to show off too.  
PARSONS: There's one thing he doesn't know.  
DOCTOR: What?  
PARSONS: You're still alive.  
DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush, shush. I'm dead, remember.  
PARSONS: (sotto) Doctor, why doesn't the ship know that?  
DOCTOR: (sotto) It's only programmed to obey instructions, not to think about
them. Blind logic. It serves Skagra and doesn't think beyond that.  
PARSONS: (sotto) Does it know where Skagra's gone?  
DOCTOR: Ship! Speaking to you as the late lamented enemy of your lord Skagra,
I command you to tell me where he has gone.  
SHIP: I do not have that information.

**[Command ship]**

(Skagra snaps his fingers and the sphere settles on a pillar.)  
ROMANA: Why don't you tell me? Why won't you just say what you're trying to
do?  
(Skagra looks out of a big window.)  
SKAGRA: Tell me what you see.  
ROMANA: Stars.  
SKAGRA: What are they doing?  
ROMANA: Doing?  
SKAGRA: Yes.  
ROMANA: Well, they're just there. They're  
SKAGRA: Exactly. Spinning uselessly through the void. And around them,
billions of people spinning uselessly through their lives.  
ROMANA: Says who?  
SKAGRA: I say.  
ROMANA: And who are you?  
SKAGRA: What I am now is not important. But what I, what we all shall
become...  
ROMANA: What do you  
SKAGRA: Shush. Look.  
(He opens his hands.)  
ROMANA: What?  
SKAGRA: What do you see?  
ROMANA: Nothing.  
SKAGRA: Billions of atoms spinning at random, expending energy, running down,
achieving nothing. Entrophy, like the stars. But what is the one thing that
stands against entrophy, against random decay? Life. See how the atoms are
arranged here? They have meaning, purpose. And what more meaning and purpose
than in here. (his head) You do not understand me. Your mind is too limited.
My Krargs. They shall be the servants of the new generation.  
ROMANA: New generation? New people?  
SKAGRA: Not new people. A new person.

**[Krarg generator room]**

(They enter a vapour-filled room.)  
ROMANA: What?  
SKAGRA: Shush.  
(Skagra activates a machine, and a new Krarg is created. Giant shaggy alien
red yeti with post-it notes instead of fur, pretty much.)  
KRARG: What is your command, O master?

**[Spacecraft]**

(The Doctor is working inside some panelling.)  
PARSONS: So it's back to square one, then.  
DOCTOR: That's it! Ow! Ouch!  
PARSONS: What?  
DOCTOR: Square one. That's where we've got to go if we want to find out what
Skagra's up to. Once we know that, we know where to find him. Ship, I order
you to take us to where your lord Skagra last came before arriving here.  
SHIP: Your order does not conflict with my programmed instructions. I will
activate launch procedures. Launch procedures activated. Launch procedures
activated. Launch procedures activated.  
(Somewhere, more Krarg are created. Skagra's ship becomes visible once it is
airborne and zooms off into space.)  
DOCTOR: Ship, how long will the journey take?  
SHIP: Thirty nine astro-siderial days.  
DOCTOR: What? That's neary three months.  
SHIP: At maximum drive. We have many hundreds of light years to cover.  
PARSONS: Hundreds of light years in three months? That's incredible.  
DOCTOR: Yes, incredibly slow. Stop.  
SHIP: Repeat, please.  
DOCTOR: I said, stop. Halt. (Juddering halt knocks Parsons off his feet.)  
PARSONS: Oh, what are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Ship, I'm now going to introduce you to a few new concepts. Now listen
very carefully. Reverse the polarity of your main drive feed. Right?  
SHIP: Accomplished.  
DOCTOR: Regrade your de-ossilation diagetic synthesisers by ten points.  
SHIP: Warning. Drive will explode in twelve seconds. Eleven. Ten.  
DOCTOR: Did I say ten points? Sorry, minus ten points.  
SHIP: Accomplished.  
DOCTOR: Realign your maxivectal meter on drag so they cross-connect with your
radial bicentric arrows.  
SHIP: Accomplished.  
DOCTOR: Good. Now, this is the easy bit.  
(More Krargs emerge.)  
PARSONS: What have you done?  
DOCTOR: I've constructed a primitive dimensional stabiliser by remote control.
The journey will now only take a couple of minutes to anywhere.  
SHIP: Doctor, you are extremely ingenious, for a dead man.  
DOCTOR: Oh, well, let's not harp on that aspect too much, shall we?  
(A familiar sound is heard as the ship dematerialises.)

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(Clare lies unconscious on the carpet as the lights on the control panel
continue to blink. She starts to wake up, bumps her head on the underside of
an occasional table, then gets up and sits on a chair. Chronotis pops up from
behind the back of the chair next to her, wearing a nightcap and gown. Clare
jumps out of her skin)  
CHRONOTIS: What have you done to my machine?  
(He switches off the console, and the vague background humming stops.)  
CHRONOTIS: Tea?  
(Chronotis goes into the kitchen and comes straight out with the tea tray.)  
CLARE: May I ask who you are?  
CHRONOTIS: I was, I am, I will be, Professor Chronotis. Oh dear. We
Gallifreyans have never managed to come up with a satisfactory form of grammar
to cover these situations.  
CLARE: Look, I don't understand what's happening. What situation?  
CHRONOTIS: (sitting) Timelessness. Standing obliquely to the time fields.  
CLARE: Is that what we're doing?  
CHRONOTIS: Oh yes, and very grateful I am to you for arranging it.  
CLARE: Me? But all I did was just press a button and  
CHRONOTIS: Yes, I know. A very ancient Tardis, this. I rescued it literally
from the scrap heaps. I'm not allowed have one really, you know. Still, just
as well though, isn't it, otherwise I'd be dead still.  
CLARE: Still dead?  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, yes. Yes, I've been killed. Only your timely mishandling of
this machine meant that you tangled with my time fields at the critical
moment. You're not following me, are you?  
CLARE: Er, no.  
CHRONOTIS: Good. Think of me as a paradox in an anomaly and get on with your
tea.  
CLARE: Oh, yes.  
CHRONOTIS: We must find Skagra.  
CLARE: Yes.  
CHRONOTIS: He has the book.  
CLARE: Ah!  
CHRONOTIS: You know about it?  
CLARE: Well, I sort of  
CHRONOTIS: It's a very dangerous book and I have been very careless. It is the
key to Shada.  
CLARE: Oh.  
CHRONOTIS: The ancient prison planet of the Time Lords. They have been induced
to forget about it.  
CLARE: I see.  
CHRONOTIS: If Skagra is meddling with mind transference, mind control, he's
only going to Shada for one particular reason and it is imperative that he be
stopped.  
CLARE: Yes! Er, why? What on Earth's there?  
CHRONOTIS: It's not a matter of what, it's a matter of who.

**[Command ship]**

(An image of what the Doctor saw on the pages of the book is on a wall screen,
projected by the sphere.)  
ROMANA: What's so important about the book?  
SKAGRA: It is the Ancient Law of Gallifrey.  
ROMANA: So?  
SKAGRA: So what does a Gallifreyan judge say when passing sentence?  
ROMANA: Er, we but administer. You are imprisoned not by this court but by the
power of the Law. It is not  
SKAGRA: The power of the Law. It used to be quite literally true.  
ROMANA: What? You think that book is some sort of key to  
SKAGRA: The key with which the Time Lords used to imprison its most feared
criminals. Criminals such as... He doesn't know. He doesn't know the code.  
ROMANA: I'm glad you realised that. It's about time.  
SKAGRA: Time. Time. About time. Yes, of course. I should have seen that. A
Gallifreyan code would have to include the dimension of Time. (to the sphere)
Stop. Find me the Doctor's last reference to Time.

**[Spacecraft]**

DOCTOR: Oh, come on, ship. What's taking you so long?  
SHIP: Estimated docking time, two minutes.  
DOCTOR: Hurry up.  
(A Krarg appears in the doorway behind them.)  
KRARG: Who are you?  
PARSONS: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Ah, hello there.  
PARSONS: (sotto) What is it?  
DOCTOR: (sotto) I don't know.  
KRARG: You are intruders.  
DOCTOR: Well actually, I'm dead, and this is Bristol.  
PARSONS: Chris.  
KRARG: You trespass on my lord's ship. You shall die.  
DOCTOR: K9!  
(K9 fires his laser.)  
PARSONS: What on Earth is it?  
DOCTOR: What's Earth got to do with it? Looks like some sort of crystalline
structure.  
SHIP: Preparing to dock.  
DOCTOR: You go ahead. Don't mind us.  
(The spacecraft materialises inside the shuttle bay.)

**[FSAS Space Station - outside the shuttlebay]**

(The place has gotten dark and dirty since we were last here. The Computer is
still repeating the message from the top of the story.)  
COMPUTER: This is a recorded message. The Foundation for the Study of Advanced
Sciences is under strict quarantine. Do not approach. Do not approach.
Everything is under our control.  
PARSONS [OC]: Where is this place?  
DOCTOR [OC] How should I know?  
PARSONS [OC]: Big, isn't it?  
DOCTOR [OC]: I wonder where everybody's got to?  
(They come out of the shuttle bay.)  
PARSONS: I don't know.  
DOCTOR: Neither do I.  
PARSONS: And I don't believe that we travelled hundreds of light years.  
DOCTOR: Why not?  
PARSONS: You cannot travel faster than light. Einstein.  
DOCTOR: What? Do you understand Einstein?  
PARSONS: Yes.  
DOCTOR: What? And quantum theory?  
PARSONS: Yes.  
DOCTOR: What? And Planck?  
PARSONS: Yes.  
DOCTOR: What? And Newton?  
PARSONS: Yes.  
DOCTOR: What? And Schoenberg?  
PARSONS: Of course.  
DOCTOR: You've got a lot to unlearn. Ah.  
(The Doctor spots the letters IASS ASD on a plaque on the wall.)  
DOCTOR: Institute for Advanced Science Studies.  
PARSONS: ASD Advanced State of Decay?  
DOCTOR: Shush.  
PARSONS: What?  
DOCTOR: Shush. Did you hear something?  
PARSONS: No.  
DOCTOR: Shush.

**[FSAS Space Station]**

(They enter the room from the first scene in the story.)  
DOCTOR: Ah ha! Think Tank. Quite interesting.  
(The Doctor turns off the broadcast.)  
PARSONS: Quite interesting? This is fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. Do
you mean to say that all this means something to you?  
DOCTOR: Oh yes! It's all terrible simple. You see, when ah!  
(Then they see the five remaining men huddled together, all terribly hairy and
with very long nails now.)

**[Tardis]**

(Skagra is reading the book as the time rotor goes up and down. Romana
enters.)  
SKAGRA: Keep back.  
(The sphere pins her to the doors. She notices that the time rotor stops when
Skagra ceases to turn pages. Then he notices it too.)  
SKAGRA: Exactly. Time runs backwards over the book. As I turn the pages within
the time field of this machine, the machine operates. Turning the last page
will take us to Shada.

**[Command ship]**

(Skagra hands Romana over to a Krarg.)  
SKAGRA: I have broken the code.  
KRARG: We can repair it, my lord.  
SKAGRA: Fool. Make all preparations for the entry into Shada. You are about to
meet one of the greatest and most powerful criminals in all history.  
ROMANA: Salyavin.  
SKAGRA: A man the Time Lords chose to forget.

**[FSAS Space Station]**

PARSONS: Who are they? What are they, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Victims of Skagra's brain drain. Their intellectual powers have been
stolen. But their memory patterns might remain. Yes.  
(The Doctor sits in one of the central seats.)  
PARSONS: But if only they could tell us what happened to them.  
DOCTOR: Yes. What?  
PARSONS: If only they could tell us what happened to them.  
DOCTOR: Bristol?  
PARSONS: Yes?  
DOCTOR: Bristol, I'd like you to do something for me.  
PARSONS: Certainly.  
DOCTOR: It won't be pleasant.  
PARSONS: Oh.  
(Meanwhile, K9 is still holding the Krarg at bay with a continuous laser
beam.)  
(The Doctor places one of the brain-drained men on a seat. Parsons is sitting
on another one.)  
DOCTOR: Easy, easy. There, there. Bristol?  
PARSONS: Yes?  
DOCTOR: I'm going to allow this man access to your intelligence reserves.  
PARSONS: Oh.  
DOCTOR: It's all right, it's only temporary. But it might just allow him to
function.  
PARSONS: I just hope you know what you're doing.  
DOCTOR: So do I. So do I. Now, take a deep breath.  
(The Doctor goes to the free-standing console and adjusts the controls, then
goes to a wall panel and cranks up the power. The pyramid between the seats
begins to twinkle, and Parson's head is pulled back between the receptors. The
Doctor checks the lifesigns of the man, who then touches his head, making him
jump.)  
CALDERA: Skagra!  
(K9 continues to hold the Krarg, but it is getting stronger.)  
CALDERA: Who are you?  
DOCTOR: The Doctor.  
CALDERA: What are you doing here?  
DOCTOR: Who are you?  
CALDERA: My name is Caldera.  
DOCTOR: What? Not A St John De Caldera?  
(pronounced a singe on de caldera...)  
CALDERA: The same?  
DOCTOR: The neurologist.  
CALDERA: Yes.  
DOCTOR: It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. One of the great intellects of your
generation.  
CALDERA: So are we all.  
DOCTOR: What?  
CALDERA: There's A S T Thira, the psychologist. G V Centauri, the
parametricist. L D Ia, the biologist. R A F Akrotiri.  
DOCTOR: Some of the greatest intellects in the universe.  
CALDERA: And Doctor Skagra.  
DOCTOR: Skagra?  
CALDERA: Geneticist, and astro-engineer.  
DOCTOR: What?  
CALDERA: And cyberneticist, and neurostructuralist, and moral theologian.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and too clever by seven-eighths. Who is he? Where does he come
from?  
CALDERA: We don't know.  
DOCTOR: What?  
CALDERA: But he was very impressive. He offered very handsome fees, so we
agreed.  
DOCTOR: To do what?  
CALDERA: Don't you see? The Think Tank was his idea. He set it up.  
DOCTOR: He did? To do what?  
CALDERA: The pooling of intellectual resources by electronic mind
transference.  
DOCTOR: What?  
CALDERA: He conceived it on the grand scale. Just how grand, we didn't
realise. Not at first, not until after we had built the sphere, and by then it
was too late.  
DOCTOR: Why? What happened?  
CALDERA: He stole our brains! He stole our brains.  
DOCTOR: Easy, easy.  
CALDERA: Stole.  
DOCTOR: Easy. Shush, shush, shush.  
CALDERA: The whole of humanity.  
DOCTOR: What? The whole of humanity?  
CALDERA: The whole! But he needed  
DOCTOR: What did he need?  
CALDERA: One mind.  
DOCTOR: Which mind?  
CALDERA: One unique mind.  
DOCTOR: What mind?  
CALDERA: A man called  
DOCTOR: What was he called?  
CALDERA: A man called  
DOCTOR: What was he called?  
CALDERA: Salyavin!  
DOCTOR: Salyavin?  
(K9 runs out of power and backs out of the spacecraft, followed by the
lumbering Krarg.)  
DOCTOR: Bristol? Bristol? Are you all right?  
PARSONS: I feel marvellous!  
DOCTOR: Good, good, it'll pass. You're fit.  
PARSONS: What did you find out?  
DOCTOR: Not much. Not enough to locate Skagra, just enough to frighten me out
of my wits.  
K9: Master!  
DOCTOR: K9! Why aren't you back at  
(The Krarg is behind K9, it's upper torso and head glowing red hot. It fires
energy bolts at the cowering scientists.)  
DOCTOR: K9, try and keep it back.  
K9: Power supply at danger level.  
(The Doctor tries to creep past, towards the members of the Think Tank. The
Krarg raises its arm.)  
PARSONS: Doctor, look out!  
(The Doctor avoids the blast and rejoins Parsons. The Krarg advances on them.)

__**Part Five**__

**[FSAS Space Station]**

DOCTOR: Bristol?  
PARSONS: Yes?  
DOCTOR: You still feeling marvellous?  
PARSONS: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Right. Give me ten seconds.  
PARSONS: What?  
(The Doctor goes round the back of Parsons to the cowering Think Tank. Parsons
takes up a boxing pose.)  
PARSONS: Well, come on then! Well, come on!  
(The Krarg turns away from him and hits the sparkling pyramid.)  
PARSONS: Doctor, it's going to blow up!  
(The Doctor stands in front of the scientists as the Krarg advances on them.
Smoke starts to fill the room. Parsons runs behind the Krarg and out into the
corridor, where he grabs a dangling power cable, then goes back in. K9 leaves.
Parsons drags the Doctor out of the room.)

**[FSAS Space Station - outside the shuttlebay]**

DOCTOR: It's jammed!  
(The Krarg attacks the scientists. The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver, and
the door rises. The Doctor, Parsons and K9 get underneath it just as the Krarg
arrives on the scene. The door closes in front of it. The spacecraft
dematerialises and the space station goes KaBOOM!!)

**[Spacecraft]**

DOCTOR: Good ship, good ship. Good, you're learning. Which is more than we're
doing.  
PARSONS: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: Well, we're still no nearer to finding Skagra or Romana.  
PARSONS: What do you think we should do?  
DOCTOR: I don't know.  
PARSONS: Well, try looking on the bright side. At least we're  
DOCTOR: I am looking on the bright side, and it's dark, very dark. Now listen
to me, ship. I'm going to ask you once again. Where is your lord Skagra?  
SHIP: He did not reveal his destination.  
PARSONS: But you must have some idea?  
SHIP: I am a computer. I do not have ideas. I obey instructions.  
DOCTOR: So you've no idea where he's gone.  
SHIP: I do not.  
DOCTOR: Bah. Doesn't he have a home to go to?  
SHIP: Yes.  
DOCTOR: He has?  
SHIP: Correct.  
DOCTOR: Well, then why didn't you tell me?  
SHIP: I have orders not to.  
DOCTOR: But, will you please take us there?  
SHIP: The order conflicts with my programmed instructions.  
DOCTOR: Well, just you tell it not to worry. I'm sure your lord Skagra will be
very anxious to pay his last respects to me.  
SHIP: I obey.  
DOCTOR: I do hate computers. They're so literal minded. Aren't you, K9?  
K9: Affirmative, master.

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(Chronotis is dressed to go out, and he and Clare are working on components
from his Tardis mechanism.)  
CLARE: Oh. Look, I don't even know what I'm meant to be doing.  
CHRONOTIS: We must get this old perambulator moving again.  
CLARE: Well, it certainly moved when I touched it.  
CHRONOTIS: Oh, a spasm, a mere spasm. I just hope it wasn't a dying spasm,
because it has left us jammed between two irrational time interfaces. Time is
moving away from us. If we do manage to disentangle ourselves, I'll just have
to be careful, otherwise I shall cease to exist again.  
CLARE: Oh. Really?  
CHRONOTIS: Now do as I do.  
CLARE: What's that?  
CHRONOTIS: Forget about it.  
CLARE: Oh, Professor, that's easier said than done. Who is this, er, Salyavin
person?  
CHRONOTIS: Salyavin? He was a criminal. His exploits have been wildly
exaggerated. He was a hotheaded, brilliant young man with a peculiar talent. I
can't fix this.  
CLARE: Can I help?  
CHRONOTIS: Difficult, very difficult. To repair an interfacial resonator
requires two operations which must be performed absolutely simultaneously. And
to be honest, my dear, I don't think you have the knowledge.  
CLARE: So we're stuck.  
CHRONOTIS: Yes.  
CLARE: Well, I can learn, you know. I'm very quick.  
(Chronotis fetches a large wrench from the kitchen.)  
CLARE: What's the matter?  
CHRONOTIS: Listen to me. Listen to me very carefully. What I am about to do,
you are never to speak of, and this is the only time I will ever do it.  
CLARE: What are you talking about?  
CHRONOTIS: Do I have your promise?  
CLARE: Well, what are you going to do to me?  
CHRONOTIS: Do I have your promise?  
CLARE: Yes, yes, all right.  
CHRONOTIS: What is that piece of equipment you have in your hand?  
CLARE: I have absolutely no idea.  
CHRONOTIS: Good.  
(Chronotis puts down the wrench and takes off his spectacles. His eyes glow as
he stares hard into Clare's eyes.)  
CHRONOTIS: Now, what is that piece of equipment?  
CLARE: This? Er, it's a conceptual geometer relay, with an agronomic trigger,
a totally defunct field separator. But it doesn't matter. We can dispense with
it if we can get that interfacial resonator working again.  
CHRONOTIS: Splendid!  
CLARE: Well, let's do that then, shall we?

**[Command ship]**

(The spacecraft materialises on the hangar deck right next to another
identical spacecraft. Lots of Krarg are still being made here.) SKAGRA: Well?  
KRARG: We have a full complement, my lord.  
SKAGRA: Good. Then we can begin.  
(The Krarg leave. A finger taps Romana on the shoulder and she gasps.)  
DOCTOR: I wish you wouldn't do that.  
ROMANA: How did you get here?  
DOCTOR: These kind people brought me.  
SKAGRA: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Ah, hello there.  
SKAGRA: I am a little surprised to find you here.  
DOCTOR: Your ship was a little surprised  
SKAGRA: Oh, you stole my ship.  
DOCTOR: Only after you stole mine. Ah, there she is. I hope you've been
looking after her. If you've been over-revving her...  
SKAGRA: I'm curious to know how you survived the attentions of my sphere.  
DOCTOR: Well, it only looks for what it expects to find. I made it look for
the wrong things.  
SKAGRA: If you've come here in the hope of interfering with my great purpose.  
DOCTOR: Great purpose? Great purpose? Ha!  
SKAGRA: The very greatest purpose, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: You want to take over the universe, don't you. I've met your sort
before. Any moment now a mad gleam will come into one of your eyes and you'll
start shouting, the universe shall be mine.  
SKAGRA: How naive, Doctor. How pathetically limited your vision must be.  
DOCTOR: Limited?  
SKAGRA: Take over the universe? How childish. Who could possibly want to take
over the universe?  
DOCTOR: Exactly. That's what I keep telling people. It's a troublesome place,
difficult to administer. And as a piece of real estate, it's worthless,
because by definition there'd be no one to sell it to.  
SKAGRA: Such visions are for infants. My purpose will fulfil the natural
evolutionary goal of all life.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes?  
SKAGRA: With the aid of these spheres, I shall make the whole of creation
merge into one single mind, one god-like entity.  
DOCTOR: You will?  
SKAGRA: The universe, Doctor, shall not, as you so crudely put it, be mine.
The universe shall be me.  
DOCTOR: Ah. Have you discussed this with anyone? I mean, why don't you send
one of your rocky pals off to make some tea and we can sit down and chew on a
macaroon.  
SKAGRA: Doctor, your inane whitterings do not interest me. This will happen.
It will start within hours. And once it has started, nothing you or anyone
else can do will stop it. Take them away. They bore me.  
(Krargs bear down. The Doctor taps one.)  
DOCTOR: Jink!  
(He grabs Parsons and runs.)  
SKAGRA: Kill them.  
(K9 follows the Doctor, but Romana is held fast.)  
ROMANA: What's a jink?

**[Command ship corridor]**

(The Doctor, Parsons and K9 hide in an alcove as the Krarg lumber past.)  
DOCTOR: Clever jink that, don't you think? I made them think I was trying to
get to the Tardis.  
PARSONS: What were you trying to do?  
DOCTOR: Get to the Tardis.  
PARSONS: Doctor, that man must be mad, mustn't he?  
DOCTOR: Oh, madness, sanity, it's all a matter of opinion.  
PARSONS: And what's your opinion?  
DOCTOR: He's as mad as a hatter. They've gone. Right, back the way we came.
Quietly.  
(Further on they hear a stuttering sound.)  
DOCTOR: Shush.  
PARSONS: (sotto) What?  
DOCTOR: That.  
PARSONS: Your Tardis. Surprised you can hear it from here.  
DOCTOR: There's something odd about it. Come on.  
(A Krarg fires a bolt that just misses Parson's head.)  
DOCTOR: Run!  
PARSONS: It's a dead end.  
DOCTOR: Then we're trapped.  
(A wooden door with a brass knob is against a wall.)  
PARSONS: This wasn't here before.  
DOCTOR: Get in!

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(The door bursts open and the Doctor and Parsons run in from the Carrier
corridor and slam it shut again. They quietly congratulate each other then
turn to see where they are. Their jaws hit the floor with a loud Thud!)  
PARSONS: Keightley!  
CLARE: Chris?  
CHRONOTIS: Cup of tea?  
DOCTOR: Tea? (Shortly afterwards, the chasing Krarg has moved off and the
Doctor is sitting at the control panel.)  
CHRONOTIS: Doctor, how do you like my Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Oh, ace. Ace.  
CHRONOTIS: It's strictly unofficial. I'm not really allowed to have one.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and what better way to hide it than by living in it, you old sly
boots.  
CLARE: What are you doing here?  
PARSONS: How am I'm suppose to know. Yeah, and what's the Professor's room
doing here?  
CLARE: Oh, you may well ask. But ask the Professor.  
CHRONOTIS: Doctor, where is Skagra?  
DOCTOR: Shush. Not so loud. He's just outside.  
CHRONOTIS: Oh.  
DOCTOR: He's got Romana, he's got the Tardis, he's got the book. I thought you
were dead, Professor.  
CHRONOTIS: Yes, so did I.  
DOCTOR: Did you really?  
CHRONOTIS: Listen, Doctor, if Skagra has the Tardis and the book, he can get
to Shada.  
DOCTOR: Shada? Shada?  
CHRONOTIS: Yes, the Time Lords' prison planet. You've probably forgotten about
it.  
DOCTOR: I never forget anything. I never forget. Well, that's right. I have
forgotten. The Time Lords' prison planet. Now why would I have forgotten? Got
it. Of course! Salyavin was imprisoned on Shada. Yes. Ask me who Salyavin is.  
CLARE: Oh, now he was a great criminal imprisoned centuries ago by the Time
Lords.  
DOCTOR: A great criminal. Unique mental powers. He had the ability to project
his mind into other minds, completely take them over, didn't he, Professor?  
PARSONS: That's what Skagra's doing?  
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, no, no. Quite the opposite. Skagra had the capacity to
take minds out of people, but he can't put minds back into them. That's why he
needs Salyavin in the sphere, and that's why he's going to Shada.  
PARSONS: Of course!  
CHRONOTIS: Doctor! He must not get there.

**[Tardis]**

(Skagra allows the pages of the book to turn over one at a time, as the time
rotor moves.)  
SKAGRA: The key turns slowly in the lock. The door to Shada opens.

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(Clare is pouring tea for everyone.)  
DOCTOR: With Skagra's mind and Salyavin's in the sphere, Skagra will be
omnipotent.  
PARSONS: What, you really mean he could just move himself into every mind in
the universe?  
DOCTOR: Yes, eventually. It might take thousands of years, but that wouldn't
matter. His mind's immortal. It would spread like a disease.  
PARSONS: It's quite a thought though, isn't it? I mean, every mind working
together as a single organism, a single mind.  
DOCTOR: Skagra's mind. Not a pleasant thought.  
CLARE: Doctor, we've got to stop him from getting to Shada.  
DOCTOR: Yes. But how? He's got a start on us and we don't know where it is.  
CHRONOTIS: Then we must follow him.  
PARSONS: But how?  
CHRONOTIS: The same way as we arrived.  
DOCTOR: You followed the Tardis' space-time track. Of course! Of course. Let's
go!

**[Shada]**

(The prison is set into an asteroid. The Tardis materialises.)  
SKAGRA: Shada.  
ROMANA: It looks horrid.  
SKAGRA: It was built by your race. A prison planet.  
ROMANA: I hope you feel at home.  
SKAGRA: Keep her silent.  
(Skagra activates a console.)  
SKAGRA: The index. Ah. Chamber T, cabinet 9. Two of you guard this machine.
You, bring the girl. Come.  
(Walking along.)  
SKAGRA: This is where your people used to put the criminals they wanted to
forget.  
ROMANA: I've never even heard of it.  
SKAGRA: Obviously you forgot. This way.  
(Meanwhile, a wooden door materialises.)

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

CHRONOTIS: Doctor, we're arrived!  
DOCTOR: Good! Good! Now, you two  
CLARE + PARSONS: Yes?  
DOCTOR: Stay here.  
CLARE: Oh but  
DOCTOR: Shush. I am not at liberty to explain. K9, you can come along, but no
tangling with any Krargs, unless of course if you have to tangle with any
Krargs.  
CHRONOTIS: Hurry! Skagra will be here already. Come on.  
DOCTOR: Come on, K9. Come on. Come on.

**[Shada]**

SKAGRA: The prisoners of Shada. Each in their own separate cryogenic cell.
Alive, but frozen, in perpetual imprisonment. Very humane.  
ROMANA: Don't look at me. I'm not answerable for the Time Lords.  
SKAGRA: You are a Time Lord.  
ROMANA: Yes, but  
SKAGRA: No matter. The Time Lords will son be irrelevant. Before I find
Salyavin, I think I shall release some of these. They can be the first to
participate in the new universal mind.  
(Skagra works controls, and doors slide open. Various aliens wake up.)

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

PARSONS: Oh, it's odd the way some days work out, isn't it?  
CLARE: Chris.  
PARSONS: I mean, there I was, just cycling down King's Parade  
CLARE: Chris, there's something very strange about the Professor.  
PARSONS: Why single out the Professor?  
CLARE: Well, because when I was in  
PARSON: I want to know what's going on out there.  
CLARE: Chris, you're not listening to me.  
PARSONS: I just don't like getting left behind. I mean, just because we come
from Earth, it doesn't give everybody the right to be patronising towards us.
Well, admittedly, all this does make us look a bit primitive. I mean, I
haven't got the faintest idea how it all works.  
CLARE: I have.

**[Shada]**

SKAGRA: Cabinet 9. Here he is. The man I've spent my whole life searching for.
The man whose mind will reshape the entire universe. The great Salyavin. Let
us release him.  
DOCTOR: Skagra, stop!  
ROMANA: Doctor!  
SKAGRA: Keep away from here. You're too late. Salyavin is released.  
(The door slides open to reveal an empty cell.)  
SKAGRA: I don't understand. Salyavin. Where is Salyavin?  
(Chronitis's eyes glow.)  
SKAGRA: You!

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

PARSONS: Let me just get this right. You say he just walked into your mind?  
CLARE: Well, sort of. It's as if he just barged in the front door and started
shuffling all my thoughts about.  
PARSONS: But the Doctor said that that ability was unique to the guy, well,
the guy Skagra's come here to find. On your feet, Keightley. Come on, let's
see what's happening. Shush.  
(Parsons and Clare go out into Shada.)

**[Shada]**

DOCTOR: You're Salyavin?  
CHRONOTIS: Well guessed, Doctor.  
SKAGRA: Salyavin. I have you here at last. We have everything we need.  
DOCTOR: K9, the sphere! Shoot the sphere!  
(The sphere explodes, then reassembles into multiple smaller spheres. One
fastens onto Chronotis, who collapses.)  
SKAGRA: Now, Doctor, stay very, very still. You are about to see the beginning
of the universal mind.  
(The sphere floats away from Chronotis. Other spheres attach themselves to the
freed prisoners. Nearby -)  
CLARE: Quietly, Chris.  
PARSONS: Come on.  
CLARE: No!  
(Parsons runs in.)  
SKAGRA: Sphere!  
(A sphere attaches to Parsons.)  
SKAGRA: Now, Doctor, we will deal with you.  
(Parsons and the prisoners advance on the Doctor.)

__**Part Six**__

**[Shada]**

DOCTOR: K9!  
(K9 guns down a prisoner, but a Krarg drags Romana into the firing line.)  
DOCTOR: K9!  
K9: Master.  
(The Krarg picks up K9 and throws him across the room.)  
ROMANA: Run!  
(Romana ducks under the Krarg's arm, picks up K9 and runs out with the
Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: I told you to stay in the room.  
(They run into Clare.)  
CLARE: Yes, but  
DOCTOR: Come on.  
CLARE: But Chris.  
DOCTOR: Come on, to the Tardis.  
(They run past the door, the Doctor changes his mind and goes inside.)

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

DOCTOR: Quick, come in, come in. Come on, K9. Sit down!  
(K9 is under his own power now. Romana and Clare sit quietly while the Doctor
thinks for a few moments.)  
DOCTOR: Got it!  
(The Doctor goes into the Professor's bedroom, through the door that was
originally hidden by the Doctor's Tardis.)  
CLARE: Well, what are we going to do?  
ROMANA: So far he's beaten us on every point.  
CLARE: Yes, he's even got Chris.  
ROMANA: Mmm.  
DOCTOR: Shush, shush. Quiet, I'm thinking.  
(The Doctor comes back in from the kitchen.)  
DOCTOR: I'm thinking, and it depresses me. Skagra's little zombie gang have
got the brain power of the greatest intellects in the universe shared out
among them. The Think Tank.  
CLARE: The who?  
DOCTOR: Never mind about that. Just believe me. All the minds that Skagra's
stolen are now in the melting pot along with his own, and operating as one.
And with the Professor's, I mean with Salyavin's mind in there too, they can
now control anyone. They can control everyone. They'll be invincible.  
ROMANA: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes?  
ROMANA: May I just remind you of something?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
ROMANA: All the minds that Skagra's stolen are in the melting pot.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
ROMANA: That means yours is in there too.  
DOCTOR: Yes! Romana?  
ROMANA: Yes, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Romana, I want you to do something for me. Stand there. Romana, I want
you to wear this.  
(The Doctor pins a medal on Romana's blouse then kisses her on both cheeks.
They salute each other.)  
DOCTOR: Well, now I can think.

**[Tardis]**

(The Krargs, prisoners, Parsons and the spheres are all here.)  
SKAGRA: We will return to the carrier ship. From there a fleet of small craft
will take each one of you to selected centres of population, and then the
great mind revolution shall begin.  
(The Tardis dematerialises.)

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

DOCTOR: It'll be tricky.  
ROMANA: And dangerous.  
DOCTOR: Well, a touch.  
ROMANA: Doctor, it'll be terribly, terribly dangerous for you. You'll stand
about as much chance as  
DOCTOR: As what?  
ROMANA: As a. There isn't anything that stands as little chance as you will
out there.  
DOCTOR: Well, I'll just have to be, I'll just have to be very brave, won't I.  
ROMANA: Doctor, it isn't funny.  
DOCTOR: Listen, I can do your part if you can do mine.  
ROMANA: I'll try.  
DOCTOR: You're a hero. Remember? Clare?  
CLARE: Yes, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Hold on very tight.  
(The Door appears in the Vortex next to the Tardis. The Doctor and Romana
operate Chronotis's Tardis controls simultaneously.)  
DOCTOR: Ready?  
ROMANA: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Clare?  
CLARE: Ready, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Hold tight. Now!  
(A green light reaches out from the Door to the Tardis)  
DOCTOR: Ha ha! Got them. Well done, Romana.  
ROMANA: We haven't got to the hard bit yet.  
DOCTOR: No, we haven't got long. Clare?  
CLARE: Yes, Doctor, I'm holding on.  
DOCTOR: Come over here and hold on to this, then.  
(Clare takes hold of the very long lever.)  
DOCTOR: And whatever you do, don't let go, because we are in for a very, very
rough ride.  
(A short time later.)  
DOCTOR: And twenty thirdly, out there in the space-time vortex, time and
distance have no meaning, but here in this little, little room  
ROMANA: Oh, get on with it, Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Romana?  
ROMANA: Yes, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I want you to switch off the vortex shields in this small area here.  
(He indicates somewhere near the kitchen with the toasting fork.)  
DOCTOR: Come on, you can do it. I showed you how to do it. Just one little bit
of timelessness and spacelessness over there behind the tea trolley.  
(Romana makes careful adjustments. The area wibbles and the tea trolley rolls
across the floor.)  
DOCTOR: I said behind the tea trolley, not in the middle of it.  
ROMANA: I'm sorry, but it's very difficult.  
DOCTOR: Focus it! Now just one steady line, eh? One. Steady. Hold it. Hold it!  
ROMANA: I'm trying, Doctor. I'm trying!  
DOCTOR: Phew. Right. Now this is a little trick I learnt from a space-time
mystic in the Quantocks. He made it seem very, very easy.  
(The Doctor walks forward and vanishes.)  
CLARE: Oh! He did it!  
ROMANA: Hold that switch down!  
(The Doctor is crawling through the green light between the two time
capsules.)  
ROMANA: It won't hold much longer. It's fading even faster than the Doctor
said it would. K9. K9, wake up and come here.  
(Clare and Romana swap levers so that Romana can open the cupboard underneath
the console.)  
ROMANA: Check out the subneutron circuits.  
K9: Detect circuit malfunction, mistress.  
(The Doctor is nearly at the Tardis.)  
K9: Impossible to effect repair in time available, mistress.  
ROMANA: Well, hold it, K9. Stop it deteriorating.  
K9: Impossible to stop it, mistress. I can only slow down circuit
deterioration.  
ROMANA: The Doctor needs every second we can give him.  
CLARE: This switch is getting very hot.  
ROMANA: You must hold it down.  
CLARE: But I can't. It's getting hotter.  
(The Doctor is starting to to slide backwards.)  
CLARE: It's burning me.  
ROMANA: Oh, hold it down with a pencil.  
CLARE: But I haven't got one.  
(Romana tries to reach one on a pile of papers whilst hanging on to the long
lever.)  
ROMANA: I can't reach it.  
CLARE: Oh. Well, here, hold this.  
(Clare releases her switch and the console goes bang! The girls are thrown
across the room.)  
K9: It's broken.  
(The link between the time machines is gone. They whirl off through the
Vortex, and so does the Doctor. Romana bandages Clare's burnt hand.)  
CLARE: What about the Doctor?  
ROMANA: I don't know. It was a very dangerous idea trying to make that
crossing. He didn't get as much time as he wanted. I just don't know.  
CLARE: What should we do?  
ROMANA: Well, we'll just go ahead as planned. There. How's that?  
CLARE: Oh, it's fine, thank you. It wasn't a bad burn. Look, do you think the
Doctor will be all right?  
ROMANA: We'll just go ahead as planned.  
K9: Repairs completed, mistress.  
ROMANA: Let me see. Good boy, K9. Now we can go. Though I dread to think what
we're walking into if. Oh, well, let's just do it.

**[Workshop]**

(The Doctor tumbles into a room. There are racks of odds and ends against the
wall, including a Cyberman's head. He starts to collect bits and pieces.)  
DOCTOR: Good. Good. Good.

**[Command ship]**

(The Tardis materialises.)  
SKAGRA: And soon, an infinite consort of the mind.

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor sneaks into the console room with a helmet device he has made in
his own workshop.)  
DOCTOR: Hello, old girl. How've you been keeping? Sorry I had to barge in
through your back door like that, but if you had any idea what it's like to
travel through the Space-Time Vortex... Ha, ha, of course you do. Silly me.
You do it all the time. But at least you're built for it. Now, let's see
what's happening outside, shall we?  
(The scanner shows Skagra and his crew standing outside the Door to
Chronotis's Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: Look out behind you! Let's go and say hello.  
(The Doctor opens the Tardis doors and blows on a dog whistle.)

**[Command ship]**

SKAGRA: Out you come, Doctor. Out you come.  
(The Door opens with a creak and K9 comes out.)  
SKAGRA: He sends his dog out to face me.  
(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis and walks up behind Skagra.)  
SKAGRA: Stop hiding in there, Doctor. Come out and meet your fate.  
DOCTOR: Hello.  
SKAGRA: Doctor! How did you get in there?  
DOCTOR: What do you mean, how did I get in there. It's mine, I belong in
there.  
SKAGRA: As of now, Doctor, you don't belong anywhere at all. There is no place
for you in my universe. You shall die.  
DOCTOR: Well, Skagra, that's a very interesting theory. (puts on helmet) Let's
try putting it to the test, shall we?  
(He turns the helmet on and stares at Skagra. The prisoners also stare at
Skagra.)  
SKAGRA: Doctor, what have you done?  
(The prisoners advance on Skagra. He concentrates hard and they turn towards
the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: No, what have you done? You've used that deranged billiard ball once
too often. You forget, there's a copy of my brain in there too, eh? Think
about it.  
(The prisoners advance on Skagra again, then get a little confused.)  
DOCTOR: But not too hard, old chap. You might strain yourself. A new universe,
a new single mind. Ha. I think your little bunch are in two minds about that
one already.  
(Skagra clicks his fingers and a Krarg moves towards the Doctor. The Doctor is
blocked by the prisoners.)  
DOCTOR: K9!  
K9: Master.  
DOCTOR: Fire!  
(K9's laser heats up the Krarg.)  
DOCTOR: Now, lay on, Skagra. Let's see the quality of your mind.  
(The two men concentrate.)  
DOCTOR: A little warm for the time of year, wouldn't you say, Skagra? Off, K9.  
(The super-heated Krarg staggers backwards.)  
SKAGRA: Not that way. The other way, you fool. The other way! Back!  
(Two more Krarg approach K9 from the rear.)  
DOCTOR: K9!  
(K9 turns and heats them up too. The first Krarg has entered the chamber where
it was first created. Romana pushes it into a vat, where it sizzles. Then she
stands one of the other vats upright and pulls two wires from the wall.)  
ROMANA: Clare! Clare!  
(Clare opens the Door as the prisoners back the Doctor up against a wall.
Romana talks to her behind Skagra's back.)  
DOCTOR: K9, stop firing.  
ROMANA: Now!  
(Clare and Romana drop the live wires onto the floor. The electricity surges
through the hot Krarg and they explode. The Doctor gets the prisoners to move
on Skagra again.)  
DOCTOR: You want to call half-time, Skagra? You can have a short break if you
like, suck a lemon. Perk you up no end.  
(Skagra runs for his life.)  
SKAGRA: Ship! Take off instantly. Instantly, do you hear? Instantly!  
(The cube appears and he vanishes. Back in the main area, Parsons wakes up.)  
PARSONS: Doctor, look out! Doctor. Where am I? CLARE: It's all right. It's all
right, Chris. It's over. Everything's going to be all right.  
PARSONS: Clare?  
DOCTOR: How are the others?  
ROMANA: They're all in shock, but there's no serious damage.  
(The Doctor kicks a defunct sphere.)  
ROMANA: I hate to think what would have happened to them if that tug-of-war
had carried on much longer.  
DOCTOR: They wouldn't have been the only ones in trouble. This is a fearful
mess.  
ROMANA: Can you unscramble them all?  
DOCTOR: Oh. Yes. It'll take a few hours, but they'll all get their own minds
back.  
ROMANA: What'll you do with them then?  
DOCTOR: Take them back to dear old Shada.  
ROMANA: Put them back in a forgotten prison?  
DOCTOR: Let the Time Lords sort it out. I'm not going to play judge and jury.
It was only forgotten about because the Professor made us forget. He didn't
want his escape to be discovered. That must be why he stole the book when he
left Gallifrey.  
ROMANA: Do you suppose he's still alive?  
DOCTOR: Well, we'll find out.  
(He puts two halves of a sphere together and tosses it over his shoulder.)

**[Brig]**

(The cube deposits Skagra into the room on the spacecraft where he had
previously imprisoned the Doctor, Parsons and K9. He looks rather small here.)  
SKAGRA: Ship! Let me out of here. I am your Lord Skagra. Let me out!  
SHIP: I'm afraid I can no longer accept your orders. You are an enemy of my
lord the Doctor.  
SKAGRA: I am your lord! I built you! Release me, I command you. And launch
instantly!  
SHIP: Do you know the Doctor well? He is a wonderful man. He has done the most
extraordinary things to my circuitry.  
SKAGRA: Release me!  
SHIP: Truly wonderful. If you like, I will tell you all about him.  
(Skagra sinks to his knees in despair.)  
SKAGRA: Let me out! Let me out!

**[St Cedd's College]**

(Wilkin and a police constable walk slowly though the college.)  
CONSTABLE: Stolen a room?  
WILKIN: That is the only way I can describe it.  
CONSTABLE: Well, you see, sir, in my experience people don't usually steal
rooms very much. They may steal from rooms, but steal the rooms themselves?
Very rarely. In fact I think, er, never is probably the word I'm looking for
here, sir. I mean, where's the advantage in it? Not much of a black market in
rooms, is there? Wouldn't get much for it.  
(They go through to the next courtyard.)  
WILKIN: I know it's very difficult to understand. It's also very easy to be
sarcastic.  
CONSTABLE: Sarcastic, sir? I don't know the word. Now why don't you run over
the salient points again?  
WILKIN: Oh. Well, I got to the door of the room and I opened it, and beyond it
there was nothing.  
CONSTABLE: Nothing at all, sir?  
WILKIN: Absolutely nothing at all. Well, nothing except for this sort of blue
haze.  
CONSTABLE: Ah, well, the blue haze, you see, sir, may be the vital clue we're
searching for.  
WILKIN: And I was not drinking.

**[Outside Chronotis' rooms]**

CONSTABLE: So this is the famous door, is it sir?  
WILKIN: Yes.  
CONSTABLE: Behind which you saw your er, blue haze?  
WILKIN: Yes.  
(The Constable knocks on the door.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Come in!  
(The constable opens the door to reveal a coat on a peg beyond, and the rest
of the rooms.)  
CONSTABLE: Well, whoever took it, sir, seems to have brought it back, don't
they.

**[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]**

(Chronotis is serving tea to the Doctor, Romana, Clare and Parsons as Wilkin
and the Constable enter. The Doctor is reading out loud from The Old Curiosity
Shop by Charles Dickens. Chapter 71, if you're interested. Or is he?)  
DOCTOR: Her little homely dress, her favourite, cried the old man, pressing it
to his breast and patting it with his shrivelled hand. She'll miss it when she
wakes.  
CHRONOTIS: Hello? Can I help you?  
CONSTABLE: Routine inquiry, sir. Report that this room has been stolen.  
DOCTOR: Huh!  
CHRONOTIS: Stolen? I don't think so, officer. (to Parsons) Ah, here you are.
Cup of tea and some aspirin.  
PARSONS: Thank you, Professor.  
CONSTABLE: Aspirin, sir?  
PARSONS: Yes, headache.  
CONSTABLE: Bad night last night, sir?  
PARSONS: Yes, you could say that.  
CONSTABLE: A lot of celebrating going on in college, was there, sir, last
night?  
WILKIN: Nothing out of the ordinary.  
CONSTABLE: Be normal high jinks that would be then, sir, would it? Students
roaming the streets stealing policeman's helmets, bollards, and  
(The constable spots a blue police telephone box parked in the corner.)  
CONSTABLE: Might I ask where you got that, sir?  
DOCTOR: Yes, it's mine.  
CONSTABLE: Oh, really, sir?  
DOCTOR: Yes, really. Come on, Romana. Bye, Wilkin, Bristol, Keightley.
Goodbye, Professor, we'll keep your secret.  
ROMANA: Bye everybody.  
(The Doctor and Romana enter the Tardis with the book.)  
ALL: Bye!  
CONSTABLE: Secret, sir? And what secret would that be?  
(The Tardis dematerialises.)  
CHRONOTIS: Cup of tea?  
CONSTABLE: Where did that police box go?  
CHRONOTIS: What police box that would be, officer?  
CONSTABLE: Right. Right. Coats on, everyone. You're all taking a little walk
with me down to the Bridewell.

**[Tardis]**

(New live action scene. The Doctor is working under one side of the console,
and K9 on the other. Romana is supposed to be in an inner room or corridor,
because Lalla won't work directly with Tom.)  
ROMANA [OC]: Where was Skagra from, anyway?  
DOCTOR: K9's metabolic analysis says he was from the planet Dronid. Remember
your Time Lord history?  
(Whatever K9 was doing makes the console go bang!)  
DOCTOR: Oh! There was a schism in the College of the Cardinals. The rival
President set up shop of Dronid. They forced him to come back by totally
ignoring him. (Laughs then stands, but we only see his hands on the console.)  
ROMANA [OC]: It seems hard to believe the Professor was the great Salyavin.
He's such a nice old man. I wonder if the stories of Salyavin were
exaggerated?  
DOCTOR: (the elderly Tom Baker.) More than likely. The Time Lords over-react
to everything. Look at the way they treat me. I expect at some time in the
future, about two hundred years time, someone will meet me and say, is that
really the Doctor? He seemed such a nice old man.  
(Laughs directly to camera.)
