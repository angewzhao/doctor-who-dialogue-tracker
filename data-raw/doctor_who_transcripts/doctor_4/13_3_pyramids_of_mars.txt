**Pyramids of Mars**  
  
Original Airdate: 25 Oct, 1975  

__**Part One**__

**[Archeological dig]**

(The pyramids of Saqqara are tumbledown piles of mud bricks compared to those
on the Giza plateau. Inside a tomb, a large stone door is being removed.)  
SCARMAN [OC]: Gently. Be careful. That's it.  
(A tall, patrician-like man with a wonderful Roman nose enters the unsealed
room with an oil lamp and views its wall paintings.)  
SCARMAN: It's perfect. It's absolutely untouched. The reliquaries are still
sealed. Look at this. Great heaven, this tomb must date back to the First
Dynasty of the Pharaohs. How many thousands of years since the priests sealed
the inner chamber and draped this tapestry across the entrance?  
(He pulls the tapestry aside to reveal a large Eye carved into the stones
above a set of cartouches.)  
SCARMAN: Achmed, your lantern, man. Quickly, quickly. It's the Eye of Horus.  
ACHMED: No, Professor Scarman!  
(Achmed calls out in his native tongue as the local workers flee the tomb.)  
SCARMAN: Come back! Come back! I need your help! Superstitious savage. I've
come too far to turn back now.  
(Professor Scarman starts to pry at the stones with a mattock when they
quietly slide open. He enters the inner chamber, a green light hits him, then
he screams and falls.)

**[Tardis]**

(The Tardis is in flight, and the Doctor is just standing still when Sarah
enters in an Edwardian dress.)  
SARAH: Hey, Doctor. Doctor, look what I've found.  
DOCTOR: Hello, Vicky.  
SARAH: What?  
DOCTOR: Hmm? Where did you get that dress?  
SARAH: I just told you. I found it back there in the wardrobe. Why, don't you
like it?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I always did. Victoria wore it. She travelled with me for a
time.  
SARAH: Well, as long as Albert didn't wear it. Oh, come on, Doctor. That's
worth a smile, surely? What's the matter? You should be glad to be going home.  
DOCTOR: The Earth isn't my home, Sarah. I'm a Time Lord.  
SARAH: I know you're a Time Lord.  
DOCTOR: You don't understand the implications. I'm not a human being. I walk
in eternity.  
SARAH: What's that supposed to mean?  
DOCTOR: It means I've lived for something like seven hundred and fifty years.  
SARAH: Oh, you'll soon be middle aged.  
DOCTOR: Yes! About time I found something better to do than run around after
the Brigadier.  
SARAH: Oh, come on. If you're tired of being UNIT's scientific advisor, you
can always resign.  
(Just then the Tardis goes dark and tilts. A console panel explodes then the
lights come back on and Sarah sees the image of a strange animal-like skull
hanging in the air. It disappears.)  
SARAH: What was it?  
DOCTOR: The relative continuum stabiliser failed.  
SARAH: No, not that. I mean the thing.  
DOCTOR: What thing?  
SARAH: There was a terrible face just for a second, then it was gone. You
don't believe me, do you.  
DOCTOR: Nothing can enter the Tardis. Unless  
SARAH: Unless what?  
DOCTOR: Mental projection of that force is beyond imagination, yet it might
explain the stabiliser failure. Let's see. Was it at this end of the spectrum?  
SARAH: No, Doctor, don't! Whatever it was, I know it was totally malevolent.  
(Bump.)  
DOCTOR: We've landed.  
SARAH: Where? Where have we landed?

**[Storage room]**

(They step out into a room cluttered with painted and gilded sarcophagi and
boxes.)  
DOCTOR: We've materialised at the correct point in space, but obviously not in
time. A temporal reverse? Some vast impulse of energy has drawn the Tardis off
course.  
SARAH: You're saying this in UNIT HQ, but years before I knew it?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
SARAH: But it's so different. It can't be the same house.  
DOCTOR: It must be the old priory. The UNIT house was built on the site.  
SARAH: The old priory was burnt down, wasn't it?  
DOCTOR: Something's very wrong.  
SARAH: Doctor, I don't like it here.  
DOCTOR: Something's going on contrary to the laws of the universe. I must find
out what.

**[Study]**

(Somewhere in the house, someone is playing a cabinet organ with all the stops
out. The butler knocks but is not heard, so he enters. The Egyptian theme is
continued in the gilded and coloured decor, a the mummy case on a raised dais.
There is also a desk.)  
COLLINS: Excuse me, sir.  
(The man at the organ is wearing a red fez.)  
NAMIN: Get out. Get out of here! (he stops playing) How dare you disturb me?
Get out. Get out at once!  
COLLINS: I'm sorry, sir, but the gentleman insisted.  
NAMIN: Gentleman? What gentleman?  
COLLINS: He's an old friend of Professor Scarman, sir.  
NAMIN: I ordered that no one was to be admitted, Collins. I told you no
callers!  
(The gentleman enters.)  
WARLOCK: Don't blame Collins. Forced entry, sir.  
NAMIN: This is outrageous.  
WARLOCK: Call it what you like. I've a few questions to put to you.  
NAMIN: All right, Collins.  
(Collins leaves.)  
NAMIN: So you have some questions?  
WARLOCK: My name is Warlock. Doctor Warlock. I live in the village, and
Professor Scarman is my oldest friend.  
NAMIN: I am Ibrahim Namin.  
WARLOCK: I know your name. It's your business that I am concerned with. Called
at the lodge on my way up. Had a word with Scarman's brother, Laurence. He
tells me you've had the infernal impudence to bar him from this house.  
NAMIN: I am acting under instructions from Professor Scarman.  
WARLOCK: I don't believe it.  
NAMIN: I have his letter of authority. I have brought back from Egypt all the
relics discovered by the Professor on his recent expedition. My orders are to
store them safely and allow no one admittance to the Professor himself
returns. That is an end to it, Doctor Warlock.  
(Namin snatches the letter back from Warlock's hands.)  
WARLOCK: Oh, no, sir. Not by a long chalk!

**[Outside the study]**

(Collins is eavesdropping.)  
WARLOCK [OC]: I came here to find out what's going on, and I'm not leaving
until I do.  
(The knob on a door across the hall is rattling.)

**(Storage room]**

DOCTOR: Why bother to lock an internal door?  
SARAH: Maybe this wing of the house isn't in use. It smells musty enough.  
DOCTOR: That isn't all must, Sarah. Some of it's mummy. French picklock. Never
fails. Belonged to Marie Antoinette. Charming lady. Lost her head, poor thing.  
(Collins starts to unlock the door from the other side, and the Doctor and
Sarah hide until they see who has entered.)  
DOCTOR: Of course, it would make an ideal headquarters for some paramilitary
organisation. This room could easily be turned into a laboratory. Oh, hello.  
COLLINS: Who are you? How did you get in here?  
DOCTOR: Through the window. I understood the property was for sale. No?  
COLLINS: Ah, you're not fooling me, sir. You came with Doctor Warlock, didn't
you.  
DOCTOR: Did we?  
COLLINS: He asked you to scout round whilst he kept his nibs busy. Listen, if
you're a friend of Doctor Warlock, sir, tell him to watch out.  
SARAH: Watch out for what?  
COLLINS: The Egyptian. There's no knowing what he might do. He's got the
temper of the devil himself.  
DOCTOR: Egyptian, eh? Is this where he keeps his relatives?  
COLLINS: It's no joke, sir. He's only been here a few days. I wouldn't be
staying, but, well, situations aren't easy to find at my age.  
DOCTOR: What are you afraid of?  
COLLINS: He locked this wing. He didn't know there was a second key. If he
were to find me along here, let alone you two, he'd go stark raving mad, sir.  
DOCTOR: I see. In that case, we'd better leave.  
COLLINS: Oh, not this way, sir. Better go the way you came. He might see you.  
DOCTOR: As you wish.  
COLLINS: And remember to tell Doctor Warlock what I said, sir.  
DOCTOR: Don't worry. I'll remember.  
(The Doctor helps Sarah out of the window and they walk around the outside of
the magnificent Stargrove Manor, Hampshire, ducking down under the other
windows on their way. Collins watches them go, unaware of movement in a mummy
case behind him.)

**[Outside the study window]**

WARLOCK [OC]: Utter humbug. That letter's a bogus fabrication if ever I saw
one.  
NAMIN [OC]: Are you alleging that it is forged?  
WARLOCK [OC]: I am, sir, and I intend to prove it.  
NAMIN [OC]: I warn you, Doctor Warlock, do not interfere.  
WARLOCK [OC]: Are you threatening me?

**[Study]**

NAMIN: It is not I who threaten. There are ancient powers gathering in this
place. Powers beyond the comprehension of unbelievers.  
(Namin gazes at a black-faced mummy case.)  
WARLOCK: Ancient balderdash. Now let me warn you, Namin. Unless you give me
some straight answers, I'm going to the police.  
NAMIN: To say what? That a foreigner is living in Professor Scarman's house?  
WARLOCK: To say that he's not been seen for weeks. That his baggage is lying
unclaimed in his hotel. Oh, yes, I've had some enquiries made in Cairo.  
(A man screams.)  
WARLOCK: What the devil?  
(Namin and Warlock run out of the room. The Doctor and Sarah climb in through
the window.)

**[Storage room]**

NAMIN: Open, the fool.  
(The mummy case closes just before they enter. Collins is lying by the window,
his face a picture of horror. Warlock examines him.)  
WARLOCK: Poor fellow. He's been strangled.  
NAMIN: The gods have returned. I, Ibrahim Namin, servant of the true faith,
rejoice in their power.  
WARLOCK: Get the police. His assailant can't have got far.  
NAMIN: You blind, pathetic fool. The servants of the All Powerful have arisen.
When the temple is cleansed of all unbelievers, the High One himself will come
among us. This is how it was written.  
WARLOCK: Yes, I see. Well, I still think the police  
(Namin has a revolver pointed at Warlock.)  
NAMIN: You should have listened when I told you to leave, Warlock. Now you
have seen too much. You must be the second unbeliever to die.  
(The Doctor lassoes Namin with his scarf just as he fires, and pulls him to
the floor.  
SARAH [OC]: Come on, quick.  
(Warlock leaves as the Doctor holds Namin down, then leaves too. Namin gets
up, straightens his jacket, then opens the mummy case to reveal a bandaged
figure that is not quite human. There is a definite ridge running down the
middle of its face with hollows either side, and the rib cage is very high and
prominent. Namin points a scarab ring at it.)  
NAMIN: Abisme, Sutekh. Molachah. T'nab.  
(The mummy steps down out of its case.)

**[Priory gardens]**

(The Doctor is half-carrying Warlock, who was shot high in the right chest.)  
WARLOCK: It's no good, I can't go much further.  
DOCTOR: You must. We're sitting ducks if we stay here.  
WARLOCK: Get to the lodge. Tell Laurence  
DOCTOR: Laurence?  
WARLOCK: Marcus Scarman's brother. He live there. Knows me.  
(Warlock collapses.)  
DOCTOR: He needs help, Sarah. You go on ahead, find the lodge.  
SARAH: What about you?  
DOCTOR: I'll be all right.  
SARAH: Okay.  
(Sarah runs off up the steps and through the gate while the Doctor picks up
Warlock and carries him, leaving his bowler hat behind.)

**[Woods]**

(Further on, in a wooded area, Sarah hides in a hollow as the mummy comes
near. Namin finds the bowler hat and follows the Doctor, revolver at the
ready. The mummy leaves and Sarah runs off and arrives outside the lodge. Now
it is the Doctor who is hiding from the mummy in the hollow. Namin arrives,
hears something and turns.)  
NAMIN: The All Powerful descends. O noble god, your servant hears you. Namin
leaves, followed by the mummy. Sarah arrives with Laurence Scarman.)  
LAURENCE: Oh, my dear chap. Is he badly hurt?  
DOCTOR: He'll be all right if we can staunch the bleeding.  
LAURENCE: We'd better get him back to the lodge.  
SARAH: Doctor, listen. I saw a mummy. A walking mummy!  
DOCTOR: Mummies are embalmed, eviscerated corpses. They don't walk.  
SARAH: But this one did.  
DOCTOR: Never mind about that now.  
(Back in the study, Namin prostrates himself before the mummy case then prays
in his own language.)

**[Lodge]**

(Sarah makes Warlock comfortable on a couch in Scarman's study and covers him
with a blanket. His right arm is in a sling.)  
WARLOCK: Thank you.  
SARAH: Now, is there anything I can get you?  
WARLOCK: No, no, I'm all right now.  
SARAH: Just try and rest, then.  
LAURENCE: Well, in view of what you've told me, I'm going to fetch the police.  
DOCTOR: No! This is much too grave a matter for the police, Mister Scarman.  
LAURENCE: Too grave?  
DOCTOR: Yes. They'd only hamper my investigation.  
LAURENCE: Your investigations?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Why do you think I'm here? Something's interfering with time,
Mister Scarman, and time is my business.  
LAURENCE: Who are you?  
SARAH: Well, I'm Sarah Jane Smith. I'm a journalist.  
LAURENCE: Journalist? Who is your companion?  
SARAH: My companion? Oh, that's just the Doctor. We travel in time, Mister
Scarman. I'm really from 1980.  
LAURENCE: That is utterly preposterous, Miss Smith.  
SARAH: Yes. Sorry.  
DOCTOR: Interesting contraption.  
LAURENCE: Kindly leave that alone, sir. That apparatus is delicately adjusted,
and furthermore is a receiver containing highly dangerous electrical current.  
(It looks like a sort of seismograph to me, complete with wiggly lines on
paper cylinder, yet with a perforated wheel added.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, so I see. What year is this?  
LAURENCE: What year?  
DOCTOR: It's a simple enough question, surely.  
LAURENCE: Are you telling me you don't know what  
DOCTOR: If I knew I wouldn't ask. Don't be obtuse, man.  
LAURENCE: Nineteen hundred and eleven.  
DOCTOR: Ah. Splendid. An excellent year. One of my favourites. Yes. I really
must congratulate you, Mister Scarman.  
LAURENCE: On what?  
DOCTOR: Inventing the radio telescope forty years early.  
LAURENCE: That, sir, is a Marconiscope. It's purpose  
DOCTOR: Is to receive radio emissions from the stars.  
LAURENCE: How could you possibly know that?  
DOCTOR: Well, you see, Mister Scarman, I have the advantage of being slightly
ahead of you. Sometimes behind you, but normally ahead of you.  
LAURENCE: I see.  
DOCTOR: I'm sure you don't, but it's very nice of you to try. Now, why don't
you show me how this gadget works?  
LAURENCE: Do you mean you want me to  
DOCTOR: Please. Just a little demonstration.  
(Scarman flicks three switches then pulls down a lever, which connects the
electrical circuit with a spark and cloud of smoke. The wheel begins to spin.)  
DOCTOR: Amazing. That's really amazing.  
(Scarman disconnects the power but the wheel continues to spin faster and
faster.)  
LAURENCE: I can't switch it off!  
(A large diode explodes and the machine finally dies.)  
SARAH: Oh, very impressive.  
LAURENCE: It's never done that before.  
DOCTOR: Fascinating. A regular pattern repeated over and over again.  
SARAH: Like an SOS?  
DOCTOR: I wonder. Where was your aerial tuned?  
LAURENCE: Mars. Why?  
DOCTOR: I just thought I'd verify the signal.  
(The Doctor takes a small radio from his pocket and extends the aerial.)  
LAURENCE: What's that you have, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Well, in principle it's exactly the same as the gadget you've
invented, only less cumbersome. Yes, it is the same signal. Obviously
automatic. Well, if it's a message, it shouldn't be difficult to decipher.
They'd want to make it easy.  
(The Doctor starts to make notes in his notebook.)  
LAURENCE: Who would?  
SARAH: Whoever transmitted it.  
DOCTOR: Now, let's see. This pattern recurs three times in one line. Let's
call that E, the commonest letter in the language.  
(Up at the Priory, Namin is back to belting out dramatic cords on the cabinet
organ as three mummies line up in front of the mummy case. They raise their
arms.)  
DOCTOR: Beware Sutekh.  
SARAH: Sutekh?  
DOCTOR: Better known to you as Set?  
SARAH: Of course, Egyptian mythology. Set or Sutekh was one of their gods. He
was killed by Horus, god of light.  
LAURENCE: Yes, but Egyptology and Mars?  
DOCTOR: If I'm right, the world is facing the greatest peril in its history.  
SARAH: Hey, wait for me.  
DOCTOR: No. The forces that are being summoned into corporeal existence in
that house are more powerful and more dangerous than anything even I have ever
encountered. Stay here.  
LAURENCE: I've an old hunting rifle that might come in useful.  
DOCTOR: I never carry firearms.  
(The Doctor leaves.)  
LAURENCE: What I meant was that I should feel better if I could bring it.  
(Sarah is almost out of the door.)  
SARAH: Bring it.

**[Study]**

(The Doctor sneaks into the priory and opens the door to the study a little.
The mummy case starts to shimmer with many colours, and the mummies back away.
Namin leaves the organ to play itself and kneels in front of the case.)  
NAMIN: All high, all powerful, most noble Lord, thy humble servant welcomes
thee.  
(From somewhere beyond, a figure in what might be a black spacesuit appears
where the case was. Out in the corridor, Sarah enters. The Doctor gestures her
to go away.)  
NAMIN: Master, at last you are here. I, Ibrahim Namin, and all my forebears
have served you faithfully through the thousands of years that you have slept.
We have guarded the secret of your tomb.)  
(The figure walks up to Namin, smoke coming from its footsteps. It speaks very
calmly.)  
ALIEN: Stand. Look upon my face.  
NAMIN: Great One, Lord Sutekh, I dare not.  
ALIEN: Look.  
(The helmet is like the faces of the mummies, only in shining black.)  
ALIEN: Is this the face of Sutekh?  
NAMIN: Master, spare me. Spare me. I am a true servant of the great Sutekh.  
ALIEN: I am the servant of Sutekh. He needs no other.  
(Sarah, Scarman and the Doctor watch from the doorway as the alien places its
hands on Namin's shoulders. Namin starts screaming as smoke comes from his
skin.)  
ALIEN: Die. I bring Sutekh's gift of death to all humanity.

__**Part Two**__

**[Outside the study]**

(Namin falls dead onto the floor, and the black-clad alien transforms into a
human male with pale skin and red-ringed eyes.)  
LAURENCE: Marcus!  
DOCTOR: Shush.

**[Study]**

SCARMAN: Take up the generator loops.  
(The mummies move forward and pick up a set of canopic jars by the mummy
case.)  
SCARMAN: Place them in position at the compass points. Activate at ground
strength.

**[Outside the study]**

DOCTOR: Quick, hide.  
(The three scatter as the Professor leads the mummies out of the study, down
the hallway and out of the main door. After a few moments, the Doctor comes
out from behind the potted plants and signals Scarman and Sarah to get out of
the travelling trunk.)  
SARAH: Where have they gone?  
DOCTOR: To set up a deflection field around the house. He's obviously planned
every step.  
LAURENCE: Who, Marcus?  
DOCTOR: No, Sutekh.

**[Study]**

DOCTOR: Sutekh is breaking free from his ancient bonds. If he succeeds, he'll
destroy the whole world.  
SARAH: You mean Sutekh is still alive?  
DOCTOR: He destroyed his own planet, Phaester Osiris, and left a trail of
havoc across half the galaxy. Horus and the rest of the Osirans must have
finally cornered him on Earth.  
SARAH: In Egypt?  
DOCTOR: The wars of the gods entered into mythology. The whole of Egyptian
culture is founded upon the Osiran pattern.  
LAURENCE: I'm afraid this is beyond me.  
SARAH: It's beyond me, too.  
DOCTOR: Ah! Found it.  
SARAH: What?  
DOCTOR: The lodestone that drew the Tardis off course.  
LAURENCE: That's not a lodestone, that's just a sarcophagus.  
DOCTOR: No, it isn't. It's the entrance to a time-space tunnel.  
SARAH: Leading where?  
DOCTOR: To Sutekh.  
(The Doctor activates a cartouche on the case and it starts to do its
multicoloured effect.  
SARAH: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Keep back!  
(Struggling to avoid being sucked in, the Doctor manages to get a handkerchief
or something out of his waistcoat pocket and throw it into the vortex. There
is a bang and he collapses.)

**[Woods]**

(Night is falling as the local poacher checks his traps. One snaps shut
nearby. He moves forward, shotgun at the ready, to see a mummy staggering
around with the trap firmly attached to its ankle. Finally it kneels down and
pries the trap open then casts it aside. The poacher turns and runs, pausing
only to pick up his bag and a freshly caught rabbit.)

**[Study]**

SARAH: Doctor! Doctor, come on. Wake up, please.  
LAURENCE: It's no good. He took the full force of the blast.  
SARAH: They're bound to come back soon. We're trapped! Where are you going?  
LAURENCE: There's a priest hole here somewhere. Marcus and I discovered it
when we were boys.  
(A piece of ornate wood panelling springs open.)  
LAURENCE: There. It isn't very large, I'm afraid.  
SARAH: No, well, he is though, so come and give me a hand.

**[Woods]**

(Out in the woods, the fleeing poacher runs straight into an invisible wall
and falls flat on his back. He gets up and tests it again, then tries throwing
a branch at it. It bounces off.)  
CLEMENTS: Holy Moses.  
(He gathers up his bag of game and his shotgun, and makes off back the way he
came.)

**[Lodge]**

WARLOCK: Is that you, Laurence?  
(A pale figure enters.)  
WARLOCK: Marcus! Marcus, my dear fellow, you're back.  
SCARMAN: Why are you here?  
WARLOCK: Huh? What's the matter? For goodness sakes, old chap, don't you
recognise me?  
SCARMAN: Warlock.  
WARLOCK: That's right. We've all been dreadfully worried about you.  
SCARMAN: I came to find the other Scarman.  
WARLOCK: The other? You mean your brother, Laurence?  
SCARMAN: The human.  
WARLOCK: Look here, old chap. If this is some kind of macabre joke?  
SCARMAN: Where is the other Scarman, Warlock?  
WARLOCK: Laurence went up to the house. That Egyptian servant of yours took a
potshot at me! Laurence and the Doctor and some very plucky young girl went
off to deal with the brute. They've been gone a devil of a time, mind you. I
hope nothing's amiss.  
SCARMAN: Who is the Doctor?  
WARLOCK: One of Laurence's friends, I imagine. Some sort of scientist.  
SCARMAN: Why does he interfere?  
WARLOCK: Interfere? Now look here, Marcus  
SCARMAN: All humans inside the deflection barrier will be destroyed.  
WARLOCK: For heaven's sake, Marcus, what's wrong with you?  
(A mummy enters.)  
SCARMAN: Destroy this human.  
WARLOCK: No, no, no! Laurence! Laurence! No!

**[Outside the lodge]**

(Warlock's screams are clearly heard.)  
CLEMENTS: Murdering swine.  
(He runs into the trees. Marcus and the mummy leave. Clements loads his
shotgun and carefully stalks them along the carriageway.)

**[Priest's hole]**

SARAH: He's coming round.  
DOCTOR: A parallax coil.  
LAURENCE: What?  
DOCTOR: I never expected that. A simple trap. Blew up in my face. Clever.  
LAURENCE: He's delirious.  
SARAH: No, shush.  
DOCTOR: Never underestimate Sutekh. Thinks of everything.  
(The Doctor finally opens his eyes.)  
DOCTOR: Where are we?  
SARAH: Hiding.  
DOCTOR: Where?  
LAURENCE: A priest hole.  
DOCTOR: In a Victorian gothic folly? Nonsense.  
SARAH: You're so pedantic at a time like this. Does it matter?  
DOCTOR: If only I knew the exact physical location of Sutekh. Where was your
brother's expedition bound?  
LAURENCE: Saqqara, I think. He wrote to say he'd discovered a blind pyramid in
that region and believed it contained a mastaba.  
SARAH: What?  
LAURENCE: An underground burial chamber.  
DOCTOR: Saqqara. Too vague, yet it might be our only chance.  
SARAH: To do what?  
DOCTOR: Sutekh is controlling operations here by mental force. With the
equipment at the lodge, I could transmit a jamming signal.  
SARAH: And block his power?  
DOCTOR: With an etheric impulse projected along precisely the right axis, yes.
Otherwise  
SARAH: No good.  
DOCTOR: The Egyptian's ring!  
LAURENCE: What?  
DOCTOR: It's a slave relay. Calculating the reverse polarisation should be
child's play. Why didn't I think of it?  
SARAH: Shush. Listen.

**[Study]**

SCARMAN: Remove this carcass. (sniffs) There are other humans within these
walls. Seek and kill them.  
(The mummies drag Namin away.)

**[Priest's hole]**

SARAH: He's coming over.  
(Through the window, Clements sees Marcus moving his hands over the panelling,
and lets him have both barrels in the back.)  
LAURENCE: Marcus!

**[Study]**

(Marcus reabsorbs the gunshot smoke and walks over to the broken window.)  
CLEMENTS: Professor Scarman!  
(Clements drops his shotgun and runs.)  
SCARMAN: Seek and kill.  
(Two mummies set off across the lawn after Clements. Scarman leaves the study.
Our three come out of hiding.)  
DOCTOR: All right, all clear.  
LAURENCE: Where are we going?  
DOCTOR: Shush. To find that Egyptian.

**[Outside the study]**

SARAH: We can't search the whole priory. There's no need to. Look.  
(Footsteps and drag marks in the dust on the floor into the locked wing.)

**[Storeroom]**

(Some definitely non-Egyptian items are taken from packing cases.)  
SCARMAN: Follow me.  
(He leads the mummies out and past the hidden trio, who then enter the room.
Namin is lying on the floor. The Doctor removes the scarab ring.)  
SARAH: What do you think they're doing?  
DOCTOR: I'm not sure yet.  
LAURENCE: This is exceedingly interesting, Doctor. It appears to be some kind
of machinery.  
DOCTOR: You're right. Yes, that's resonating tuner. Part of an anti-gravity
drive. Oh! They must be building a rocket.  
SARAH: Egyptian mummies building rockets? That's crazy.  
DOCTOR: They're not mummies, they're service robots.  
SARAH: Huh?  
DOCTOR: Machines.  
SARAH: Machines? All right then, why are machines building rockets?  
DOCTOR: So that Sutekh can escape from the power of Horus.  
SARAH: Where's Sutekh now?  
DOCTOR: Exactly where Horus left him seven thousand years ago. Trapped beneath
a pyramid and powerless to move.  
(A door slams and they run out to hide. Laurence cocks his hunting rifle, then
the Doctor pulls him back behind a tapestry.)  
(Marcus Scarman enters with the mummies to collect more pieces of machinery.)

**[Tardis]**

LAURENCE: Great heavens! This is unbelievable. Totally unbelievable!  
DOCTOR: You're going to say it transcends all the normal laws of physics.  
LAURENCE: I am, yes. I mean, it does. It's preposterous!  
DOCTOR: Isn't it. I often think dimensional transcendentalism is preposterous,
but it works. Would you like to look around?  
LAURENCE: May I?  
DOCTOR: Please.  
SARAH: Well now we are here, why don't you tune up 1980 and we can, well,
leave.  
DOCTOR: I can't.  
SARAH: Ah. Why can't you?  
DOCTOR: Because if Sutekh isn't stopped, he'll destroy the world.  
SARAH: But he didn't, did he. I mean, we know the world didn't end in 1911\.  
DOCTOR: Do we?  
SARAH: Yes, of course we do!  
DOCTOR: All right. If we leave now, let's see what the world will look like in
1980.  
(The Doctor works the console.)  
LAURENCE: I say, this is like something by that novelist chap, Mister Wells.  
(The Tardis lands, and the doors open to show a bleak, rocky landscape with
howling winds and an electrical storm.)  
DOCTOR: 1980, Sarah, if you want to get off.  
(Sarah doesn't, and the doors close.)  
SARAH: It's a trick!  
DOCTOR: No. That's the world as Sutekh would leave it. A desolate planet
circling a dead sun.  
SARAH: It can't be! I'm from 1980.  
DOCTOR: Every point in time has its alternative, Sarah. You've looked into
alternative time.  
LAURENCE: Fascinating. Do you mean the future can be chosen, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Not chosen, shaped. The actions of the present fashion the future.  
LAURENCE: So a man can change the course of history?  
DOCTOR: To a small extent. It takes a being of Sutekh's almost limitless power
to destroy the future. Well?  
SARAH: We've got to go back.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
(Out in the woods, an exhausted Clements is hiding behind a tree catching his
breath, while two mummies stand looking around. He makes a break for it, and
they lumber after him. Further on, he falls, and they catch up to him.
Meanwhile, Laurence and Sarah have climbed out of the storeroom window.)  
DOCTOR: Keep below the level of the window.  
(They leave, then the Doctor climbs out.)

**[Study]**

(Marcus is reporting in via the mummy case.)  
SCARMAN: Three humans within the deflection barrier have been destroyed. There
are others.  
SUTEKH [OC]: Eliminate them.  
SCARMAN: The servicers are searching for them, but assembly of the rocket is
being delayed.  
SUTEKH [OC]: Destruction of the humans must not be allowed to delay the
completion of the missile. That is of paramount importance.  
SCARMAN: Your orders will be executed, Sutekh. I will recall two of the
servicers to the rocket assembly.

**[Lodge]**

(Sarah covers Warlock's face with the blanket.)  
LAURENCE: I can't believe that my brother. He and Doctor Warlock were the
closest of friends.  
DOCTOR: Well, if you can stop thinking of him as your brother it'll make it a
great deal easier for you.  
LAURENCE: But he is my brother!  
DOCTOR: From the moment he entered Sutekh's tomb he became subject to Sutekh's
will.  
LAURENCE: What does that mean?  
DOCTOR: As a human being, Marcus Scarman no longer exists. He is simply the
embodiment of Sutekh's power. He's given the paralysed Sutekh arms and legs, a
means to escape.  
SARAH: If Sutekh is so totally evil, why didn't Horus and the other Osirans
destroy him?  
DOCTOR: It's against their code. To have killed him would have meant that they
were no better than he, so they simply imprisoned him.  
(The Doctor sets about mending the Marconiscope.)  
SARAH: How?  
DOCTOR: A forcefield, controlled from a power source on Mars.  
LAURENCE: Mars?  
DOCTOR: Yes. That's where the signal was beamed from, remember?  
LAURENCE: But how?  
DOCTOR: When your brother stumbled into Sutekh's tomb, the monitoring system
on Mars detected the fact and triggered off an alarm signal.  
SARAH: The rocket those robots are building!  
DOCTOR: Yes. Will be aimed at the power source on Mars. If those warheads
reach their target, Sutekh will have released himself.  
LAURENCE: To destroy the world.  
DOCTOR: Not only this world. Anywhere that life is found. Right. All I need
now is a magneto.  
LAURENCE: A magneto. Of course.  
(Scarman goes to a cupboard.)  
SARAH: What are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: If I can block the mental beam, Scarman will collapse.  
SARAH: You mean die?  
DOCTOR: Well, he's not alive now in any real sense. Only Sutekh animates him.
Deprived of his outside contact, Sutekh'll be as powerless as the day Horus
left him.  
LAURENCE: Here you are, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Splendid.  
(A man screams outside.)  
LAURENCE: What was that?  
(The two mummies have caught up with Clements outside the lodge and are now
crushing him between their torsos. Scarman takes his rifle and shoots at them.
The Doctor goes out and drags Laurence back indoors.)  
DOCTOR: Quick, Sarah, switch on the power.  
LAURENCE: No, no, you'll destroy my brother!  
(Laurence grabs Sarah, but she elbows him in the kidneys and gets away.)  
DOCTOR: Switch on!  
(Sarah throws down the switch and the wheel spins.)

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

(On the monitor, Marcus doubles up in pain.)  
SUTEKH: Stop them!

**[Lodge]**

(The mummies burst through the front door. They knock the Doctor down and push
Scarman aside onto Warlock's corpse, then advance on Sarah.)  
SARAH: Doctor! Doctor!  
(One of them grabs her by the throat.)  
SARAH: Doctor! Doctor!

__**Part Three**__

**[Lodge]**

(The mummy holding Sarah's throat brings its other arm down and hits the
Marconiscope. There's a big bang and it starts flailing around, letting her
go, before stopping working.)  
DOCTOR: The ring, Sarah. Use the ring!  
(Sarah grabs the ring from the table.)  
SARAH: Stop!  
(The second mummy stops.)  
DOCTOR: Return to control.  
SARAH: Return to control! Return to control!  
(The mummy leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Are you all right?  
LAURENCE: Yes, I think so.  
DOCTOR: You don't deserve to be. You nearly got us all killed.  
LAURENCE: I'm sorry.  
DOCTOR: What's worse, you've probably wrecked what was my only chance of
stopping Sutekh.  
LAURENCE: Look, forgive me, Doctor. I was thinking of my brother.  
DOCTOR: Listen! What's walking about out there is no longer your brother. It
is simply an animated human cadaver. Animated by Sutekh. Do you understand?
(Laurence nods.) And if Sutekh succeeds in freeing himself, the consequences
will be incalculable. Stay here!  
(The Doctor leaves. Sarah runs to follow but Laurence grabs her arm.)  
LAURENCE: Where's he going?  
SARAH: To find out what Scarman's doing.  
(Sarah runs after the Doctor.)

**[Study]**

SUTEKH [OC]: It was a deliberate attempt to block my cytronic control.  
SCARMAN: I know nothing, Master.

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

(We get our first proper look at this being, seated on a stone throne Egyptian
style, and wearing a mask.)  
SUTEKH: I detected electromagnetic radiation. The source was within the
deflection barrier.  
SCARMAN [on monitor]: There are some humans here who have eluded the
servicers. If work on the missile is delayed, they can be found and destroyed.  
SUTEKH: No! The missile must be projected at the hour appointed. My freedom
comes before all. Immediately thereafter, you will find and kill the humans.  
SCARMAN [on monitor]: As you direct, Master, so it shall be.

**[Stable courtyard]**

(The Doctor goes through the old carriage gateway into a courtyard, and sees
the three mummies by a white shiny pyramid on a black base. It is about
fifteen feet high. Sarah sneaks up behind him.)  
SARAH: What is it?  
DOCTOR: It's an Osiran war missile, and almost complete by the look of it.  
SARAH: You mean that thing can fly?  
DOCTOR: It transposes with its projection. Pyramid power.  
(Marcus enters the courtyard.)  
DOCTOR: Back.

**[Lodge]**

(Laurence is looking at an old photograph of himself and Marcus as schoolboys
at Eton. The Doctor enters)  
LAURENCE: Did you find out anything?  
(The Doctor goes to the inactive mummy.)  
SARAH: Only that time is short.  
DOCTOR: Cytronic induction.  
SARAH: Huh?  
DOCTOR: The robots are drawing their energy from a cytronic particle
accelerator which must be in Sutekh's tomb.  
SARAH: So?  
DOCTOR: So, put that out of action and he'd have no workforce.  
SARAH: And no missile.  
LAURENCE: But Sutekh's tomb is in Egypt.  
DOCTOR: Scarman came here through the time-space tunnel. It's a two-way
mechanism.  
SARAH: But if you go through it, Sutekh'll kill you!  
LAURENCE: Wouldn't it be better  
DOCTOR: No, it wouldn't. If I go after Sutekh, Sutekh will kill me. The
missiles are aimed. Wouldn't what be better?  
LAURENCE: Wouldn't it be less risky simply to blow up the projectile?  
DOCTOR: With what?  
LAURENCE: Blasting gelignite.  
DOCTOR: Do you have some?  
LAURENCE: No, but I believe Clements had a store.  
DOCTOR: Clements?  
LAURENCE: The poacher. I heard him fishing only a few nights ago.  
DOCTOR: Where did he keep it?  
LAURENCE: I'm told he had a hut on the other side of the wood.  
DOCTOR: Let's go, Sarah.  
SARAH: Right.  
LAURENCE: Shall I show you the way?  
DOCTOR: No, we'll find it.  
LAURENCE: You think I'll let you down again, don't you.  
DOCTOR: Mister Scarman, if you want to help, start getting the bindings off
that robot.

**[Woods]**

DOCTOR: Careful. Walking into a deflection barrier is like walking into a
brick wall.  
(The Doctor holds a long stick out in front of them.)  
SARAH: Painful.  
(Boing.)  
DOCTOR: Ah. There we are. Now all we've got to do is find the door.  
(He turns left and walks along with the stick against the barrier. The beeps
get faster then stop.)  
DOCTOR: Door.  
(A jackal headed canopic jar is in the leaf litter, humming to itself. The
Doctor gets out his sonic screwdriver.)  
DOCTOR: Key.  
SARAH: As simple as that?  
DOCTOR: No, not really.  
SARAH: No, I didn't think it could be.  
DOCTOR: No obvious booby traps. Are you going to help or are you just going to
stand there and admire the scenery?  
SARAH: Your shoes need repairing. I actually wasn't admiring the scenery. I
was waiting for you to tell me what to do.  
DOCTOR: Just hold the base. I don't want it to fall.  
SARAH: Dangerous?  
DOCTOR: Very dangerous.  
(Sarah supports the base of the jar as the Doctor cranks up the screwdriver.
There is a loud noise and he backs off.)  
DOCTOR: Deactivating a generator loop without the correct key is like
repairing a watch with a hammer and chisel. One false move and you'll never
know the time again.  
SARAH: Any more comforting thoughts?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Just let me know if it starts to get warm.  
SARAH: Don't worry. You'll hear me breaking the sound barrier.

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

(A simple display on the monitor shows the position of one of the jars
flickering.)  
SUTEKH: Interference. Interference!

**[Woods]**

(The Doctor puts away the screwdriver and gently turns the lid of the jar
before lifting it off. He removes a slim silver canister from inside and
unscrews the bottom, which has electronics inside, then puts it in his
pocket.)  
DOCTOR: Just to make sure. Come on.

**[Study]**

SCARMAN: Master, I do not understand how this can be.  
SUTEKH [OC]: The barrier to the east has been deactivated.

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

SCARMAN [on monitor]: But that is not possible.  
SUTEKH: It has been deactivated. The power line has gone from my monitor.  
SCARMAN [on monitor]: The humans do not have the knowledge to shut down the
deflection barrier.

**[Study]**

SUTEKH [OC]: It is clear that an extraterrestrial intelligence is operating.  
SCARMAN: An alien?  
SUTEKH [OC]: Oh, I have endured an eternity of darkness and impotence. I shall
not be denied now. Listen to my orders.  
SCARMAN: I hear you, Master.  
SUTEKH [OC]: The missile must be guarded. Two servicers must maintain constant
vigilance.  
SCARMAN: It shall be as you say.

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

SUTEKH: Once the missile is projected, you will seek out and destroy my
enemies. The alien who dares to intrude, the humans, animals, birds, fish,
reptiles. All life is my enemy! All life shall perish under the reign of
Sutekh the Destroyer!  
SCARMAN [on monitor]: Only Sutekh shall live!

**[Outside the poacher's hut]**

SARAH: Just how powerful is Sutekh, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: He's all-powerful. If he ever gets free, there isn't a lifeform in the
galaxy that could stand against him.  
SARAH: What, not even your lot, the Time Lords?  
DOCTOR: Not even our lot.

**[Poacher's hut]**

(The Doctor undoes the chain and padlock, and enters.)  
DOCTOR: Sutekh was only defeated in the end by the combined might of seven
hundred and forty of his fellow Osirans led by Horus.  
SARAH: The seven hundred and forty gods whose names were recorded in the tomb
of Tutmoses the Third.  
DOCTOR: Could be.  
(Sarah opens a hutch to search it.)  
DOCTOR: I wouldn't do that, if I were you. Could be a ferret.  
SARAH: Argh!  
(She snatches her hand out again. Meanwhile, back at the Lodge, Laurence
Scarman has unwrapped the mummy and revealed its wire framework over a basic
skeleton. Sarah finds a box on an upper shelf.)  
SARAH: This looks like it.  
(She throws it down to the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: Ah!  
SARAH: What's the matter? Not enough?  
DOCTOR: Sweaty gelignite is highly unstable. One good sneeze could set it off.  
(He carefully puts the box on the floor.)  
SARAH: Sorry.  
DOCTOR: No sign of any detonators or fuses?  
SARAH: No, no, nothing else. Perhaps he sneezed?

**[Lodge]**

(Marcus Scarman has found the deactivated jar in the woods and continued his
search for the vandal. He sees the unwrapped robot lying on the carpet.
Laurence enters from washing his hands.)  
LAURENCE: Marcus! Marcus? Don't you know me? I'm your brother.  
SCARMAN: Brother?  
LAURENCE: Your brother, Laurence.  
SCARMAN: As Horus was brother to Sutekh.  
LAURENCE: Marcus, you're ill. Let me help you. Trust me.  
SCARMAN: Trust you?  
LAURENCE: Look. You and I when we were boys.  
(Scarman shows Marcus the photograph.)  
SCARMAN: Laurence and Marcus.  
LAURENCE: That's right. You do remember!  
SCARMAN: I was Marcus.  
LAURENCE: You still are. Now, let me help you.  
SCARMAN: No! I am Sutekh!  
LAURENCE: No, no. You went to Egypt and fell under some sort of mesmeric
influence, that's all.  
SCARMAN: Sutekh the great Destroyer. Sutekh, the Lord of Death. I am his
instrument.  
LAURENCE: Now that's all nonsense. You are Marcus Scarman, Professor of
Archaeology, Fellow of All Souls, Member of the Royal Society.  
(Marcus knocks the photograph out of Laurence's hands.)  
SCARMAN: What do you know of Sutekh? Where are the others?  
LAURENCE: Others?  
SCARMAN: You are being helped. Sutekh has detected an alien intelligence
amongst the humans here.  
LAURENCE: Do you mean the Doctor?  
SCARMAN: Doctor?  
(Marcus grabs Laurence's arms with superhuman strength.)  
LAURENCE: Marcus, your hands.  
SCARMAN: What is he? What is he?  
LAURENCE: Marcus, please.

**[Carriage gateway]**

(The Doctor carefully hides the gelignite behind an old wooden door while
Sarah peers into the courtyard proper. Three mummies guard the pyramid.)  
DOCTOR: (sotto) It should be safe there for the moment.  
SARAH (sotto): Look, this isn't going to work. You've got no detonators, no
fuses, so even if you manage to place the charge without being spotted, how do
we explode it?  
DOCTOR: I don't know yet.

**[Lodge]**

(Scarman is apparently resting in a rocking chair when the Doctor and Sarah
enter.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Mister Scarman.  
SARAH: Mister Scarman? Hey.  
(Sarah shakes Laurence Scarman's shoulder, and he falls to the floor.)  
SARAH: Oh! Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Strangled.  
SARAH: The mummies.  
DOCTOR: Not this time. There are marks. His late brother must have called.  
SARAH: That's horrible! He was so concerned about his brother.  
DOCTOR: I told him not to be. I told him it was too late.  
SARAH: Oh! Sometimes you don't seem  
DOCTOR: Human? Typical Osiran simplicity.  
SARAH: A man has just been murdered!  
DOCTOR: Four men, Sarah. Five, if you include Professor Scarman himself, and
they're merely the first of millions unless Sutekh is stopped. Know thine
enemy. Admirable advice.  
SARAH: Yes.  
DOCTOR: If we're going to do anything about that missile, we're going to have
to move quickly. I'll need your help.  
(The Doctor gathers up the mummy's wrappings.)  
SARAH: What do you want me to do?  
DOCTOR: These bindings are chemically impregnated to protect the robots
against damage and corrosion. An impenetrable disguise, wouldn't you say?

**[Storeroom]**

(Two mummies take a piece of equipment from a packing case.)  
SCARMAN: Stop. Warhead trigger charge, phase one. This must be placed directly
under the detonation head. Signify your understanding.  
(The mummies bow.)  
SCARMAN: Continue.

**[Lodge]**

(Sarah is finishing wrapping the Doctor's thigh.)  
DOCTOR: Hurry up.  
SARAH: I am hurrying.  
DOCTOR: It doesn't have to be perfect. I shall mingle with the mummies but I
shan't linger.  
SARAH: Okay, that'll have to do.  
DOCTOR: How do I look?  
SARAH: It must have been a nasty accident.  
DOCTOR: Don't provoke me. Come on. And don't forget the rifle.

**[Study]**

(Marcus enters, stands in front of the mummy case and raises his arms. The
stripes of the headdress begin to flicker.)  
SCARMAN: The task is almost completed, Master. We need now only the target
coordinates.

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

SUTEKH: At last. The coordinates for the pyramid of Mars. I release them.  
(A two foot long metal cylinder travels along the time-space tunnel and ends
up steaming on the carpet. Marcus picks it up.)  
SUTEKH: Engage the coordinates in the projection dome monitor.  
SCARMAN [on monitor]: Immediately, Master.

**[Carriage gateway]**

(The mummy that is the Doctor gestures for Sarah to take the gelignite from
its hiding place. She hands the box to him.)  
DOCTOR: You know what to do?  
SARAH: Yeah. Give you time to get clear, then pow.  
(Sarah starts to load the rifle.)  
DOCTOR: Make sure you shoot straight. You won't get a second shot.  
SARAH: Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

**[Stable courtyard]**

(The Doctor takes the long way round to the stable courtyard while Sarah
watches from the doorway. He walks straight up the ramp to the pyramid and
puts the box down. Sarah takes aim then puts the rifle down as Marcus enters.)  
SCARMAN: Stop.  
(The Doctor hesitates, then takes another step.)  
SCARMAN: Stop! Turn about. Is your relay damaged? This is the coordinate
selector. It is to be placed in the projection dome monitor. Indicate your
understanding.  
(The Doctor bows slightly.)  
SCARMAN: Then obey your order.  
(The Doctor takes the cylinder and walks up the pyramid ramp. Marcus leaves
and a mummy follows him as the Doctor puts the cylinder inside the pyramid and
comes straight out again to walk away in the direction he originally entered.
Sarah takes up position, aims and fires. The gelignite starts to explode,
stops, and reverses.)  
SARAH: I hit it. I know I hit it.  
DOCTOR: You did. Sutekh is containing the explosion.  
SARAH: How?  
DOCTOR: Mental power. There's only one hope left. I've got to get to him,
break his concentration.

**[Study]**

SCARMAN: I hear you, Master.  
(The Doctor, back in his normal clothes, appears in the doorway.)  
SUTEKH [OC]: (straining) On the missile loading ramp. A crude detonation
device. It must be removed immediately.  
SCARMAN: Another human attempt to prevent your return? They will be caught and
punished.  
(The Doctor enters and walks to the windows, then hides behind the curtains.)  
SUTEKH [OC]: The device! I cannot hold back the exothermic reaction for many
minutes. It is taking an intense toll of available energy. Attend to the
device first!  
SCARMAN: It will be done immediately, Master.  
(Marcus leaves and the Doctor comes out of hiding. He goes up the steps to the
mummy case, kneels down and reaches over to it. The time space tunnel appears.
The Doctor stands up and travels along it.)

**[Stable courtyard]**

SCARMAN: That device on the ramp. Remove it.  
(Marcus leaves. A mummy goes to the ramp.

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

(The Doctor appears in the antechamber. He starts to move the tapestry aside,
then wipes green slime off his fingers, before finally entering the main
chamber.)  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Sutekh, last of the Osirans.  
(Sutekh turns, and, with his concentration broken, the pyramid in the
courtyard blows up like a sequence from Thunderbirds. It is shown on Sutekh's
monitor. The eyes in Sutekh's mask glow green and the Doctor is pinned against
the wall of the tomb.)  
DOCTOR: Argh!

__**Part Four**__

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

(Sutekh releases the Doctor.)  
SUTEKH: No, you will not die yet. Identify yourself.  
DOCTOR: Just destroy me, Sutekh. Nothing else now is left within your power.  
SUTEKH: Identify yourself. It is within my power to choose the manner of your
death.  
(The eyes glow green again, and the Doctor clutches his head in pain.)  
SUTEKH: I can, if I choose, keep you alive for centuries, racked by the most
excruciating pain. Since your interference has condemned me for ever to remain
a prisoner in the Eye of Horus, it would be a fitting end. You would make an
amusing diversion.  
(The Doctor is released again.)  
SUTEKH: Identify yourself, plaything of Sutekh.  
DOCTOR: I'm a traveller.  
SUTEKH: From where?  
DOCTOR: Gallifrey, in the constellation of Kasterborus.  
SUTEKH: Names mean nothing. What is the binary location from galactic zero
centre?  
DOCTOR: Ten zero eleven, zero zero by zero two.  
SUTEKH: I know the planet. Data retrieval.  
(A four small panels light up.)  
SUTEKH: So, you are a Time Lord.  
DOCTOR: I renounced the society of the Time Lords. Now I'm simply a traveller.  
SUTEKH: In time and space. In time and space?  
(He does the green eyes thing.)  
DOCTOR: (screaming) Yes! Yes!  
SUTEKH: Ah. Approach closer. What are you called, Time Lord?  
DOCTOR: Doctor.  
SUTEKH: I offer you an alliance, Doctor. Serve me truly, and an empire can be
yours.  
DOCTOR: Serve you, Sutekh? Your name is abominated in every civilised world,
whether that name be Set, Satan, Sodos  
SUTEKH: Serve me, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Never! Argh!  
SUTEKH: You pit your puny will against mine? Kneel!  
DOCTOR: No!  
SUTEKH: Kneel before the might of Sutekh.  
(The Doctor is forced to his knees.)  
SUTEKH: In my presence, you are an ant, a termite. Abase yourself, you
grovelling insect.  
(The monitor lights up.)  
SUTEKH: Well, speak.  
SCARMAN [on monitor]: Sutekh, great Master, the servicers have found one of
the humans responsible for the destruction of the missile.  
SUTEKH: Their leader is my prisoner, Scarman. I have no interest in the
humans.  
SCARMAN [on monitor]: Then this one can be destroyed.  
(Marcus moves aside to reveal a mummy carrying an unconscious Sarah under one
arm.)  
DOCTOR: Sarah!  
SUTEKH: Kill it immediately.

**[Study]**

DOCTOR [OC]: No! No!  
SUTEKH [OC]: Wait.  
(A second mummy stops before it brings its hand down on Sarah's exposed neck.)  
SUTEKH [OC]: Keep the human alive, Scarman. It may have some use.  
SCARMAN: As you command, Great One, so it shall be.  
(Sarah is dropped to the carpet.)

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

SUTEKH: You are a Time Lord. What interest have you in humans?  
DOCTOR: All sapient lifeforms are our kith, Sutekh.  
SUTEKH: Horus held that view. I refute it.  
DOCTOR: Because you fear that other intelligent lifeforms may grow to rival
you in power, so you kill all life wherever you find it.  
SUTEKH: Your argument is a cloud, but I see through it into your mind. The
human girl. Ah, she travels with you.  
(The Tardis is on the monitor.)  
DOCTOR: If you can do that by mental force, Sutekh, then nothing can be beyond
you.  
SUTEKH: Nothing, except to free myself from the Eye of Horus.  
DOCTOR: You use your powers for evil.  
SUTEKH: Evil? Your evil is my good. I am Sutekh the Destroyer. Where I tread I
leave nothing but dust and darkness. I find that good.  
DOCTOR: Then I curse you, Sutekh, in the name of all nature. You are a twisted
abhorrence. Argh!  
SUTEKH: Any further insolence, Doctor, and I shall shred your nervous system
into a million fibres. Is that understood?  
(The Tardis key and chain are lifted from the Doctor's waistcoat and hang in
the air before Sutekh.)  
SUTEKH: Scarman.

**[Study]**

(Sarah is awake now.)  
SCARMAN: I hear you, Master.  
SUTEKH [OC]: My enemies have brought the means of my deliverance.  
(The time space passage opens.)  
SARAH: The Tardis key!  
SUTEKH [OC]: This allows you entry into the Time Lord's space machine. Take
one servicer and travel to the pyramid of Mars.

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

DOCTOR: He won't find that possible, Sutekh.  
SUTEKH: Scarman is my puppet. My mind is in his.  
DOCTOR: The controls of the Tardis are isomorphic.  
SUTEKH: One to one. They answer to you alone.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
SUTEKH: Then I was wise to spare you. My mind is in yours!  
(The Doctor's face goes blank, and he stands up then crosses his arms over his
chest.)  
DOCTOR: Master.  
SUTEKH: Scarman?

**[Study]**

SCARMAN: Master.  
SUTEKH [OC]: I send you the Time Lord. He will control the machine. The human
girl will accompany you. If the Time Lord shows the slightest sign of self-
will, kill her immediately.  
SCARMAN: It is understood, Great One.  
(The Doctor enters through the passage.)  
SARAH: Doctor, what's happened?  
SCARMAN: Stand back.  
(A mummy puts its hand on Sarah's shoulder and she winces.)  
SCARMAN: He is possessed by the Great One. Whom do you serve, Time Lord?  
DOCTOR: Sutekh.  
SCARMAN: Who holds all life in his hands?  
DOCTOR: Sutekh.  
SCARMAN: Who is the bringer of death?  
DOCTOR: Sutekh!  
SCARMAN: Venerate his name and obey him in all things.  
DOCTOR: Sutekh is supreme.  
SARAH: No.  
SCARMAN: Control is established, Great One.  
SUTEKH [OC]: It is well. But the Time Lords are a perfidious species. Dispose
of him when you reach the pyramid of Mars.  
SCARMAN: It shall be done. Come.

**[Tardis]**

(Marcus hands the key to the Doctor and he enters. Sarah is pushed in after
him, then Marcus and the two mummies. With his eyes rolled upwards all the
time, the Doctor closes the doors. The Tardis dematerialises.

**[Pyramid of Mars]**

(The Tardis materialises in a chamber, and Marcus comes out.)  
SUTEKH [OC]: My reading indicates an antechamber under the main pyramid. Seek
the control centre.  
(Marcus finds the hidden doorway in the wall.)  
SCARMAN: Sutekh has no further need for the Time Lord. Destroy him.  
SARAH: No!  
(A mummy puts its hands around the Doctor's throat and strangles him.)  
SCARMAN: Come.  
(Marcus and the mummy enter the control centre.)  
SARAH: Doctor.  
(She listens for his hearts, then starts to cry on his chest. The Doctor taps
her head.)  
SARAH: Ah!  
DOCTOR: You're soaking my shirt.  
SARAH: Oh, you're alive!  
DOCTOR: Respiratory bypass system. Useful in a tight squeeze. Where are we?  
SARAH: Er, pyramid of Mars.  
DOCTOR: Of course. Sutekh sent Scarman here to deactivate the pyramid. Where
is he?  
SARAH: I thought you'd become a zombie like Scarman.  
DOCTOR: Sutekh didn't need me any more, so he relaxed his grip. Now, did you
see where Scarman went?  
SARAH: Through that door. It's vanished!  
DOCTOR: It can't have vanished. It's just not visible.  
SARAH: Same difference.  
DOCTOR: Scarman must be stopped. Somehow he must be stopped.

**[Antechamber]**

(Swirling red energy is visible on columns to the right. Marcus reaches for a
control panel on the wall by another doorway.)  
SUTEKH [OC: Stay! I sense danger. That relay switch is a power conductor
terminal. Scan.  
(Marcus moves sideways along the wall.)  
SUTEKH [OC]: The bulkhead release will be concealed.  
(Marcus waves his hands over the wall next to the doorway.)  
SUTEKH [OC}: There.  
(A small panel turns round in the wall.)  
SUTEKH [OC]: Now.  
(The door opens, and Marcus and the mummy go through.)

**[Pyramid of Mars]**

(The Doctor opens the door.)  
SARAH: Tribophysics.  
DOCTOR: Yes.

**[Antechamber]**

(The Doctor nearly touches the obvious control panel.)  
DOCTOR: Oh.  
SARAH: What are you waiting for?  
DOCTOR: That's too obvious.  
SARAH: What is?  
DOCTOR: That is.  
SARAH: Well, a door handle usually is.  
DOCTOR: Not in a jail. Horus would have laid traps for the unwary.  
SARAH: I thought Horus was one of the good guys.  
DOCTOR: He was an Osiran, with all their guile and ingenuity. Ah.  
(The Doctor finds the hidden door release.)  
DOCTOR: They had dome-shaped heads and cerebrums like spiral staircases. Come
on.  
(In a second chamber, the Doctor uses a radio aerial to test one 'door
handle', which turns out to be electrified. The second one is still revealed
from where Marcus found it.)

**[Another chamber]**

(Marcus is in front of a panel covered in eight rows of five squares, each
with a black quadrilateral in it.)  
SUTEKH [OC]: Stand back and scan.  
(Marcus moves left to a similar panel with coloured parallel lines in place of
the blocks. The doorway is in between.)

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

SUTEKH: Horus. Think you can confound Sutekh with these childish stratagems?  
(He overlays the two panels on his monitor.)

**[Another chamber]**

SUTEKH [OC]: The floor is charged with explosives. Count to the fifth row up.
Extreme right solenoid.  
(The vertical black oblong.)  
SUTEKH [OC]: Press.  
(Sarah and the Doctor nearly enter, but the mummy starts to turn round and
they walk out of sight again.)  
SCARMAN: Come.  
(Marcus and the mummy leave, the Doctor and Sarah enter.)  
SARAH: It's like a Chinese puzzle.  
DOCTOR: Yes. And there's a key.  
SARAH: Oh, some key. Do you know what it means?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Obviously the length of the lines provide a scale of measurement.  
SARAH: It reminds me of  City of the Exxilons.  
DOCTOR: Don't touch anything.  
SARAH: I wasn't going to.  
DOCTOR: Well, don't. One false move and we could be blown to perdition. Feet
and inches one side, metres and centimetres the other. Let's see.  
(The Doctor uses his scarf as a measuring tape on the lines.)  
DOCTOR: A hundred and twenty point three centimetres, multiplied by the binary
figure ten zero zero. That's a hundred and sixty two point four centimetres,
correct?  
SARAH: Show-off.  
DOCTOR: Hundred and sixty two point four. That's about seven stitches.  
(He measures up the blocks and moves Sarah behind him.)  
DOCTOR: In case I'm wrong.  
(He pushes the oblong.)  
DOCTOR: I'm right.

**[Junction]**

SARAH: Which way now?  
(The Doctor explores briefly, and returns to find Sarah trapped in a large
perspex cylinder.)  
DOCTOR: A dexadron crucible!  
(Sarah is shouting but no sound is coming out.)  
DOCTOR: Keep calm! Keep calm. (sotto) Poor Sarah. I should never have brought
you hear.

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

(On the monitor, Marcus stands in front of a doorway.)  
SUTEKH: The inner chamber. The control centre of the pyramid. Make the sign of
the Eye, Scarman. The sign of the Eye.  
(Marcus crosses his arms, palms outwards, uncrosses them and turns his palms
down then reaches down and forward. The door opens.

**[Junction]**

(Sarah's prison is steaming up on the outside. The Doctor writes RELAX in it.)  
DOCTOR: I can't do it. I can't do it.  
HORUS [OC]: Intruders, you face the twin guardians of Horus. One is programmed
to deceive, the other points truly.  
(Two mummies with gold detailing have appeared, along with two red buttons on
the bottom of the tube.)  
HORUS [OC]: The two switches control your fate. Instant freedom or instant
death. Before you choose, you can ask one guardian one question. This is the
riddle of the Osirans. Which is the guardian of life?  
DOCTOR: Which indeed. They're both contra-programmed so that one will always
give a false indication. One question. If I were to ask your fellow guardian
the question, which switch would he indicate?  
(The mummy raises an arm towards the nearest button.)  
DOCTOR: I see. So if you're the true guardian, that must be the death switch.
And if you're the automatic liar, you'd be trying to mislead me, so that still
must be the death switch. Therefore, this has to be the one we want.  
(The Doctor touches the second button, and the tube and mummies vanish.)  
DOCTOR: Come on! Come on!

**[Control centre]**

(A giant red egg sits pulsing in a lotus flower stand.)  
SUTEKH [OC]: At last, the Eye of Horus! Destroy! Destroy!  
(A Horus guardian steps forward.)  
SCARMAN: Stand back. Deactivate.  
HORUS [OC]: My servitors obey only the voice of Horus. Drive out the
intruders.  
(The two mummies battle. Marcus turns into a green-eyed jackal headed entity.)  
SUTEKH: Destroy! Destroy!  
(The egg explodes as the Doctor and Sarah enter.)  
SUTEKH: Free!  
(Marcus's own head returns.)  
SCARMAN: I'm free! Free at last!  
(Marcus collapses and turns quickly into pile of dust.)  
SARAH: He's won. Sutekh's won!  
(Behind them, all the doors slide open to reveal the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: No! The time factor!  
SARAH: What?  
DOCTOR: Come on, run!  
SARAH: Doctor!

**[Sutekh's tomb]**

SUTEKH: I have won my freedom, Horus. Your curse is lifted. Now begins the
reign of Sutekh the Destroyer. I shall crush this miserable world, and hurl it
into the outermost depths of space. My vengeance starts here!  
(The Tardis leaves Mars and materialises back in the store room. The Doctor
runs out, carrying a piece of equipment, and Sarah follows him.)  
SUTEKH: My paralysis has left me. I can move again. I can move! Now, Horus, we
shall see who rules the cosmos!  
(Sutekh's mask disappears.)

**[Study]**

(The Doctor fastens two wires to the mummy case and puts his device on the
floor in front of it. The tunnel activates.)  
DOCTOR: We've got about twenty seconds. Here he comes.  
(Sutekh travels along the tunnel, but does not come out of the end.)  
SUTEKH: Who dares to interfere?  
DOCTOR: You're caught in a temporal trap, Sutekh.  
SUTEKH: Time Lord! I shall destroy you. I shall destroy you!  
DOCTOR: How long do Osirans live, Sutekh?  
SUTEKH: Release me!  
DOCTOR: Never. You're caught in the corridor of eternity.  
SUTEKH: Release me, insect, or I shall destroy the cosmos!  
DOCTOR: You're a thousand years beyond the twentieth century now, Sutekh. Go
on for another ten thousand.  
SUTEKH: I'll spare the planet Earth. I'll give it to you as a plaything.
Release me!  
(Sutekh starts to disappear along the passage.)  
DOCTOR: No, Sutekh. The time of the Osirans is long past.  
SUTEKH: No!  
DOCTOR: Go. He lived about seven thousand years.  
SARAH: He's dead. Sutekh is dead.  
DOCTOR: At last.  
SARAH: Look, I know that's the time control from the Tardis, but what did you
do?  
DOCTOR: I moved the threshold of the time space tunnel into the far future. He
could never have reached the end. After the Eye was broken, I realised that we
had little more than two minutes to get back here.  
SARAH: But how?  
DOCTOR: The time radio waves take to pass from Mars to Earth.  
SARAH: Ah. So the Eye of Horus was still holding Sutekh for two minutes after
it was broken.  
DOCTOR: Yes. You know, the Egyptians called him the Typhonian beast.  
(Boom!)  
SARAH: Doctor!  
(Flames and smoke come from the mummy case.)  
DOCTOR: That was careless of me. I forgot the thermal balance would equalise.  
SARAH: Listen, this priory was burnt to the ground, remember?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Perhaps it is time we were leaving. We don't want to be blamed
for starting a fire, do we?  
SARAH: No.  
DOCTOR: I had enough of that in 1666.  
SARAH: What?

**[Storeroom]**

(Flames blow out the study bay windows as the Doctor and Sarah get back to the
Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: Come on, come on.  
(They go inside and dematerialise as flames engulf the whole building.)
