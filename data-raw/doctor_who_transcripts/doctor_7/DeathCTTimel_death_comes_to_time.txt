EPISODE ONE: AT THE TEMPLE OF THE FOURTH  
  
TRACK 1 - THE FALL OF THE SANTINE REPUBLIC  
  
(Medieval style lute playing in the background.)  
CASMUS: Once, long ago, on an island in a sea of clouds, there was a land
where giants walked. And the giants lived amongst the other peoples of that
land. And they used their great strength to help them. But the power of the
giants was too great - their hands were too strong, their tread too heavy. And
the more they tried to help the people, the greater was the destruction that
they caused, until the people they had tried to help were no more. And the
giants were alone and the island was laid waste. And in their shame, the
giants built a temple, and there they swore that never again must they meddle
in the affairs of mortal men. And then they scattered, ever to wander abroad
in repentance until the twilight of the world. Until Death comes to Time.  
  
(Voices over static and the sounds of a battle.)  
FIGHTER PILOT: No effect, Admiral. Our weapons don't work!  
ADMIRAL METTNA: Aim for the bridge of the Gun ship. Aim for the bridge!  
FIGHTER PILOT: No effect. Still no effect. Admiral, I don't think we're even
penetrating their armour. We could use mining charges.  
ADMIRAL METTNA: They won't work either. I can see what's happening.  
(Bleeps.)  
ADMIRAL METTNA: Stand by. (Amplified) All ships, this is Admiral Mettna. We're
having no impact on their armour with our weapons. If they reach the planet,
you know what will happen. We did our best, now let's go out fighting. Disable
your containment fields, prepare for suicide runs. Aim for the bridge of the
ships and May You Find The One.  
  
(Faint radio voices about "you are cleared to land".)  
PILOT: General, we're encountering resistance. But it appears to be a merchant
fleet - mostly weakly are mining craft, sir.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Engage them.  
PILOT: Engage, fire at will ... Sir, their formation suggests they're
preparing for suicide runs.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Their whole defence effort was a suicide run. What a pathetic
display. Mining ships, huh. Pilot, get me their command craft.  
PILOT: Yes General ... Enemy craft, you have the honour of being addressed by
his Excellency General Tannis, Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces of the
Canisian Suns. You will kneel.  
(ADMIRAL METTNA's voice over the communicator is electronic and distorted.)  
ADMIRAL METTNA: (communicator) I am Admiral Mettna, Commander of the armies of
the Republic of...  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh shut up and watch. Gun ship?  
(Communicator electronic reply.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: This is General Tannis. Target city of Annet on the Northern
Continent. Pilot, what is its population?  
PILOT: Approximately nine million, sir.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Mm, good. Prepare and target a tectonic bomb.  
ADMIRAL METTNA: (communicator) No! Wait! We can negotiate terms...  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh, why do they always think they can negotiate? How many
times have we heard that, Pilot?  
PILOT: Mm.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Admiral? Admiral, do I take it you and your "fleet" surrender?
Oh dear, you hesitated. Fire.  
ADMIRAL METTNA: (communicator) No...!  
(Explosion.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: Pilot, what is the population of the city of Annet?  
PILOT: Population, nil, sir.  
(GENERAL TANNIS is amused.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: Now, Admiral, you're going to die. I'm going to destroy your
ship, and then I'm going to rape your planet. However, if you kneel and
surrender first, I may allow your remaining fleet to live. Well? Pilot,
destroy a couple of vessels.  
ADMIRAL METTNA: (communicator) No! I surrender!  
GENERAL TANNIS: Finally, reality dawns. How pathetic. All vessels fire at
will. Oh, and destroy the Admiral's ship last.  
(Explosions.)  
  
(Sounds of battle in the background.)  
PRESIDENT OF SANTINY: (Over P.A.) This is the President of the Republic of
Santine. I would like to wish you a good day. Sadly this day is far from good.
As I speak, Canisian troops are landing on our precious world. Today, as I can
give you no hope, I am giving you the last order that I shall ever give.  
(Silence falls.)  
PRESIDENT OF SANTINY: Resist the Canisians. Breathe harder to starve them of
air and as they kill you bleed on their boots. Offer them no compliance, no
words, no recognition of their existence. For it is better to die on your feet
than to live on your knees. Farewell, and may you find The One.  
(Sounds of struggle. Walking forwards.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: Ah, Mister President.  
PRESIDENT OF SANTINY: This is illegal. You are in breach of the treaty of
Carselai. You must leave at once.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh, I would. But how _can_ I leave when you are standing on my
planet?  
(PRESIDENT OF SANTINY gasps as though he has been stabbed.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: The President is dead. Long live the republic. Pilot, begin a
curfew.  
PILOT: Yes, general.  
(Bleep of communicator.)  
PILOT: All Commands! Enforce a curfew operative immediately. Anyone found
outdoors is to be shot on sight.  
(Bleep of communicator.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: I want the Senate cleared and all members of the Government
brought to me. Oh, and get me some clean boots. These have got blood on them.  
  
TRACK 2 - NO HELP IS COMING  
  
(Baby crying.)  
SOLDIER: Civilians, move to that side of the hall, Senators, this side. Move.  
SENATOR SALA: We are all members of the Government.  
SOLDIER: The children too? Do you think I'm stupid? You are now under Canisian
Command. You will do exactly as ordered or you will be killed.  
SENATOR: This is an outrageous violation. The UP will hear about this.  
(A shot, the SENATOR cries.)  
SOLDIER: And don't hold your breath for the UP. This world is blockaded. There
is no chance of escape. There is no way on or off the planet. No help is
coming.  
(Tardis materialises. The door opens.)  
THE DOCTOR: Hello! I'm The Doctor.  
  
(Opening Doctor Who theme music, arranged by Nick Romero.)  
(He is called Nik Romero only in the online version. The CD booklet mentions
him three times, each time as Nick Romero. So Nick is the name used in the CD
transcript.)  
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Doctor Who. Death Comes To Time, by Colin Meek. Episode One
- At The Temple Of The Fourth. Starring Sylvester McCoy as The Doctor.  
  
SOLDIER: Who are you?  
THE DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. And this is my companion Antimony.  
(ANTIMONY sounds like a young male.)  
ANTIMONY: How do you do.  
SOLDIER: What are you doing here? What is that machine?  
THE DOCTOR: You see, Antimony? A sign of a good enquiring mind - someone who
asks questions. What do I always say, Antimony?  
ANTIMONY: Never stop asking questions, Doctor.  
THE DOCTOR: That's my boy.  
SOLDIER: How did you get here?  
THE DOCTOR: He's going to be unconscious in just a few seconds and he's still
using his time profitably.  
SOLDIER: Answer or I fire.  
THE DOCTOR: Don't you worry about how we got here. All you need to know is
that two strangers arrived in a flying box and hit you. Antimony?  
SOLDIER: Don't move or I'll...  
(Punch and gasp as though ANTIMONY has hit him.)  
THE DOCTOR: Good boy. Tell me, which one of you is the leader of the
resistance?  
SENATOR SALA: I'm Senator Sala. I'm the leader...  
SENATOR: Sala...  
SENATOR SALA: If they find us all they'll kill us all anyway, they're shooting
people in the streets.  
  
PILOT: Sir, we intercepted a small atmosphere skipper leaving the planet.  
GENERAL TANNIS: And the occupants?  
PILOT: One alien, female.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Take her to the cells. Find out who she is and what she's
doing here.  
Yes, General.  
  
SENATOR SALA: I'm Senator Sala, I was chosen as the leader in the event of an
invasion.  
THE DOCTOR: Good, now ... listen, all of you! Please come inside the Tardis,
quickly.  
ANTIMONY: Come on! The Doctor knows what he's doing. It's bigger on the inside
than it looks.  
THE DOCTOR: Yes. Come on.  
ANTIMONY: Come on now.  
THE DOCTOR: And it's slightly more hospitable than a Canisian cell.  
  
TRACK 3 - THE RESCUE  
  
(CASMUS sounds like an old man, GOLCRUM younger)  
CASMUS: Good morning. I've come for the prisoner.  
GOLCRUM: What do you mean, you've come for the prisoner?  
(Gun prepared for firing.)  
GOLCRUM: Who are you? You're not even in uniform.  
CASMUS: Quite so. I'm not in uniform because I'm not in your army. I have
however, managed to come on board this ship and penetrate all your security
systems with ease. I am therefore likely to be quite powerful. Now, give me
the prisoner and save yourself further trouble.  
GOLCRUM: Who are you? Put your hands up!  
CASMUS: Oh dear...  
(His voice changes to an echoed voice which we will call the Command voice. It
is like the voice of Scaroth from City Of Death.)  
CASMUS: (command voice) "I am a God of The Fourth. Fear me. Unlock the door.  
(Door opened.)  
CASMUS: (command voice) "Now pick up the girl and bring her to me."  
(The sound of this being done.)  
CASMUS: (command voice) "Good. Now, sleep. Oh, and when you wake up you will
devote your life to medicine ... Ha-ha!"  
(The Command voice ends.)  
CASMUS: Wake up. Wake up! We're leaving.  
(Groan from the familiar-sounding female prisoner he has just released.)  
CASMUS: That's better. Can you hear me? Do you remember your name?  
ACE: Ace.  
  
TRACK 4 - CRYPTIC OLD MEN  
  
SENATOR SALA: We had some time to prepare. A woman with a loud voice came to
the council and warned us the Canisians were coming. But then you know that.  
SENATOR HAWK: Put your hands up!  
ANTIMONY: What? Oh, that's brilliant, that is. We just saved your lives.  
SENATOR HAWK: We shouldn't have let them come here.  
ANTIMONY: Shall I bash him, Doctor?  
THE DOCTOR: No, we need their trust. This is pointless, we're here to help.  
SENATOR SALA: Then why are you leaving us?  
THE DOCTOR: While you organise your resistance I'll visit General Tannis and
see if I can persuade him to be a bit more neighbourly. I have a way with
power-crazed dictators.  
SENATOR HAWK: You are lying! You're working for him!  
THE DOCTOR: No, no!  
ANTIMONY: Come off it.  
SENATOR SALA: Then why do you refuse to share the technology of your ship or
your weapons?  
THE DOCTOR: I told you, we don't have any weapons.  
SENATOR SALA: Then lend us this Tardis. We could go to Alpha Canis and destroy
the whole planet in the blink of an eye. At least give us that advantage over
the Canisians. Show us how to use it.  
THE DOCTOR: I can't. I can't fight with you or for you.  
SENATOR SALA: Why not? Are you a coward? Are you better than us?  
THE DOCTOR: No, no, no, no - I'm just bound by a code.  
SENATOR SALA: A code? What sort of code is it? Do you save people, but only a
little, just for a short time then run away and leave them to die?  
THE DOCTOR: I wish it were different. But I can't interfere in your internal
affairs.  
SENATOR SALA: Internal affairs? Do you call the destruction of an entire city
an internal affair? What kind of insane game are you playing?  
SENATOR HAWK: We can't risk letting them go. We should shoot them now and take
their ship.  
THE DOCTOR: All right, please, yes, shoot me, get on with it. I don't mind.
I've been dead before.  
ANTIMONY: Hang on, Doctor, I haven't.  
THE DOCTOR: But ... you should know that there are bigger things at stake than
the fate of this planet.  
SENATOR SALA: What do you mean?  
THE DOCTOR: I mean that if the Canisian occupation of Santiny becomes
permanent, they will have a springboard to a thousand other planets, each with
burning holes where cities stood. If you fight them alone, the best you can
hope for is to irritate them. But if you let me, I can destabilise the
Canisian power-base so that when you strike it will cripple them. Now, I don't
think you're going to kill us in cold blood, and you don't think we are going
to betray you. Put the gun down and let us go.  
SENATOR SALA: All right, Hawk. Now, tell me, Doctor. While you are creating a
great sabotage, what do you suggest _we_ do? Rot here and hope the Canisians
don't find us?  
THE DOCTOR: The basis of the Canisians' power is money. If you can sting them
economically that will weaken them greatly. Fight a guerrilla war and organise
your army. When their leader is weakened, you'll hear from us. You must be
ready to strike.  
CIVILIAN: Senator Sala, The trees are burning!  
SENATOR SALA: What?  
CIVILIAN: They're on fire. Look - I can't explain. You'd better look.  
  
(People muttering in alarm. Sound of burning.)  
SENATOR SALA: Nobody touch them. Everybody get back.  
THE DOCTOR: Don't worry. It's not dangerous.  
(The burning stops.)  
SENATOR SALA: What?  
THE DOCTOR: We'll be back as soon as we can. Come on, laddie.  
ANTIMONY: Eh? But Doctor...  
SENATOR SALA: But wait. What is going on? What - what does it mean?  
THE DOCTOR: I'll explain later.  
  
(Inside Tardis control room and occasional console noises.)  
ANTIMONY: Doctor, what _are_ we doing?  
THE DOCTOR: Mm? What are we doing?  
ANTIMONY: Uh.  
THE DOCTOR: What are we doing. Maybe she's right. Playing an insane game. Oh,
I'm beginning to wonder how long we can keep this up, in a complicated age.  
(Tardis door closing.)  
THE DOCTOR: Can't interfere, can't do this, can't do that. (Laugh.) I sound
like a Time Lord.  
ANTIMONY: Eh? I thought you _were_ a Time Lord.  
THE DOCTOR: If you're going to be rude, I'm not playing.  
ANTIMONY: (Laughs.) What's going on, what - what's all that tree stuff about?  
THE DOCTOR: Oh, that, yes, that. It was a rather unorthodox message to me. We
have to go to Micen Island.  
ANTIMONY: Oh. And what's that?  
THE DOCTOR: It's a planet, in the heart of the Great Nebula of Orion.  
ANTIMONY: Doctor...  
THE DOCTOR: Mm?  
ANTIMONY: What do you think's happened to Ace? Well, they said she left, I
mean, shouldn't we have heard from her by now?  
THE DOCTOR: Mm, I'm sure she'll be able to look after herself. Wherever she
is.  
(He sighs with pleasure.)  
  
TRACK 5 - THE PAINTING  
  
CASMUS: Once, long ago, in the strange dream of history, there lived an artist
named Circassius. He was a painter of such skill that his every picture blazed
with passion. One day, he painted a woman so beautiful, that she seemed to
come alive. And as he looked into the lucent eyes of his creation, Circassius
fell deeply and inexorably in love with her. His days and nights were
tormented with impossible desire. Then, one night, as he stared at the
lifeless face of his beloved and wept, he ran outside and prayed to his maker.
"Oh, Divine Creator," he railed. "I beg of you. Bring her to life, for I
cannot be without her." To his astonishment, when he next gazed at the
painting, he saw that it moved, as if the woman were indeed alive within the
picture. "My dearest," cried Circassius. "Who's calling to me?" asked the
painting. "It is I, your creator," cried Circassius. "But where are you?" she
replied. "Here. I am here. I am ... out," he said. "What is 'out'?" she
answered. "Are you left, right, up or down?" "I am ... out," he pleaded. But
she could not see him. For she lived in a world of only two dimensions -
horizontal and vertical. She was flat. She could not understand what "out"
was. She could not even conceive of what it might be. In her two-dimensional
world, she had nothing to compare it with. The third dimension was beyond her
can. Out of sight, out of mind, out of her very conception. And so Circassius
ran to the night to vent his anger at his maker for this cruel trick. But as
he stared at the heavens, another thought came to him. "Oh maker," he said,
"Where are you?" And the answer came: "Out."  
ACE: So what's that supposed to mean?  
CASMUS: It is supposed to mean that just because you cannot readily see an
order to things, it does not mean that such an order does not exist.  
ACE: So why couldn't you say that in the first place? I'd rather you just told
me what point you were trying to make instead of telling me fairy stories. I'm
not a child, you know.  
CASMUS: Age is not a measure of wisdom. But a wise man learns, and a fool
teaches.  
ACE: Well, that makes you a fool, then.  
CASMUS: (laugh.) Considering I am with you of my own free will, I fear it
does.  
ACE: So what are you doing here? Why did you rescue me from the ship? And why
won't you tell me what I'm doing here?  
CASMUS: I have already done that. You are here to learn.  
ACE: Learn what?  
CASMUS: If I could tell you in a few words, it wouldn't be worth learning.  
ACE: Huh, spare me. Then who are you?  
CASMUS: I am Casmus, your teacher.  
ACE: What if I don't want to learn?  
CASMUS: Go.  
ACE: Look, all I'm saying is that...  
CASMUS: What do you know about gravity?  
ACE: Eh? Look, if you...  
CASMUS: Don't you know? Such a simple thing.  
ACE: Of course I know. It's a force of attraction.  
CASMUS: And who made it? Who made that force that makes one body attract
another?  
ACE: Erm ... Isaac Newton, wasn't it?  
CASMUS: Isaac who? Oh. I suppose he was the one who discovered it for your
culture. No doubt he fell out of a tower or a fruit fell on his head like all
the others. What is gravity made from? What is its substance?  
ACE: It has no substance. It's, erm ... I don't know.  
CASMUS: It has no substance, it is not made from physical things, and yet it
exists. It has no substance, and yet it is far more powerful than any weapon,
any planet, any sun. That is the power of the One. It is the prime mover, the
cause of all things. It is the deep sublime intelligence of the universe. And
where there is intelligence, there is a pattern, and where there is a pattern,
there is predictability. Here you must learn to predict the movements of the
universe.  
ACE: How?  
CASMUS: Where others see the bird, you must see the flock.  
  
TRACK 6 - AN EXPLANATION  
  
CANISIAN CAPTAIN: (communicator) Properly secured, sir.  
PILOT: And the Parliament building? Where's the Government? I want those
Senators! Didn't we send a unit in?  
CANISIAN CAPTAIN: (communicator) None's announced, sir.  
PILOT: What! Take your unit and meet me at the Parliament building,
immediately.  
  
PILOT: Who ... who did this? On your feet, soldier. Where are the Senators?  
SOLDIER: Sir, they ... Sir, you won't believe it...  
PILOT: What? Get to the point now!  
SOLDIER: Sir, two men arrived in a ... a flying box and rescued everyone.  
PILOT: Really? You're right. I don't believe it.  
(Shot. Cry of SOLDIER.)  
PILOT: Now, people don't just vanish into nothing. Scour the complex. Where
_are_ they?  
  
(Echoed voices of a dream.)  
FEMALE VOICE: Save us, Doctor.  
THE DOCTOR: Where am I?  
FEMALE VOICE: Save us.  
THE DOCTOR: Where am I?  
(The voice sounds a little like the Tom Baker Doctor)  
MALE VOICE: On the edge.  
FEMALE VOICE: Save us.  
THE DOCTOR: The edge of what?  
MALE VOICE: On the edge.  
(Another voice sounds a little like the Jon Pertwee Doctor)  
MALE VOICE 2: On the edge.  
FEMALE VOICE: Save us.  
THE DOCTOR: What is the edge?  
(A third voice of an old man)  
MALE VOICE 3: Thou shalt not break the laws of destiny...  
FEMALE VOICE: Save us, save us...  
THE DOCTOR: I can't save you...  
(Tardis materialisation and THE DOCTOR starts to wake up.)  
THE DOCTOR: I can't save you. (Moans.) I can't save, can't save...  
ANTIMONY: Wake up, Doctor. Doctor ... Doctor. What...  
THE DOCTOR: Eh?  
ANTIMONY: What can't you save me from?  
THE DOCTOR: Oh, it was ... oh, a bad dream, my boy.  
ANTIMONY: Oh.  
THE DOCTOR: What's wrong?  
ANTIMONY: Oh - the Tardis has landed. We're here.  
(Tardis door opening.)  
ANTIMONY: Micen Island.  
  
TRACK 7 - AT THE TEMPLE OF THE FOURTH  
  
(Outside.)  
ANTIMONY: (sigh.) What is this place, Doctor? It must be ancient.  
THE DOCTOR: This is the Temple of the Fourth. It's been abandoned for a long
time.  
ANTIMONY: It's so peaceful. Does anyone live on this planet?  
THE DOCTOR: Not any more.  
ANTIMONY: Who are those statues of?  
THE DOCTOR: They're Time Lords, like me, but long gone.  
ANTIMONY: Did you know them?  
THE DOCTOR: Some of them.  
ANTIMONY: And what's that writing?  
THE DOCTOR: It's an epitaph. An epitaph from a bygone age. If there be blood
on my sword, let it be my own. Something like that.  
ANTIMONY: And what about the writing on the tablets?  
THE DOCTOR: Oh, so many questions.  
ANTIMONY: But you told me to question everything.  
THE DOCTOR: Oh yes, forgive me, yes ... Yes, it says...  
(As THE DOCTOR speaks, a voice behind his speaking in a different language.)  
THE DOCTOR: We serve the many, till the many are One, until twilight falls and
Death comes to Time.  
(Thunder.)  
ANTIMONY: What's going on, Doctor?  
THE DOCTOR: Hide, come on!  
ANTIMONY: But I thought you said it was...  
THE DOCTOR: Shh!  
(Tardis materialises. Door opens with a hum.)  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Doctor! My dear Doctor, how splendid to see you.  
  
(Forest noises and rain.)  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: So, what have you to report? Anything interesting?  
THE DOCTOR: Nothing special. We were on Santiny. You?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Ah. I was chasing the tears of Saint Laurence. Quite
magnificent.  
THE DOCTOR: What for?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: What for? For the spectacle, old boy. Great streams of
fire across the heavens. Time was _you_ were the explorer amongst us.  
THE DOCTOR: Time was, I had time to explore. Tell me, why all the fireworks
and the burning bushes? I mean, couldn't you have summoned me in a more
discreet manner?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Discreet? Who but you would know it was me?
Communications would be intercepted. Besides, I ... I don't think there's
anything wrong with the odd bit of excitement.  
THE DOCTOR: Perhaps. But I think it might have been wise to be less blatant.
By the way, where's your assistant?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Oh, she wandered off on her own devices a while ago.
It was on a planet in Alnilam. Anyway, I prefer travelling on my own.  
THE DOCTOR: What? But you know the laws.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: (scoffs) Laws! I was at the signing of the treaty of
Carselai, don't forget. I swallowed insult after insult. I was made to make
sacrifices that I couldn't stand to do, but I did it anyway, and all the
while, I knew I could bend Time and gravity to make it better.  
THE DOCTOR: What use is this talk? I mean, what are you saying, you know it's
pointless. Haven't you thought these thoughts and forgotten them yet? We can't
live with these ideas. They're not for us.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Ah Doctor, that is an ideal. Do you really think we
can live amongst them and detach ourselves completely? No-one is immune to
emotions.  
THE DOCTOR: But you know what happened here. Have you remembered nothing? Oh
anyway, you didn't bring me here for a philosophical discussion, though.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: No, my dear Doctor, no. I did not.  
THE DOCTOR: Well, why here? And why all the secrecy?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Two Time Lords have died, violently.  
THE DOCTOR: Who died?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: The Saints, Antenor and Valentine. It ... bothers me.  
THE DOCTOR: Why? Even Time Lords die.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: No, it's - it's not that, it's deeper, I ... I sense
something unnerving, something ... terrible is about to happen, and I sense
that the taking of the lives of Antenor and Valentine is the herald of a ...
of a larger pattern. I was hoping you would have some thoughts. What do _your_
dreams tell you?  
THE DOCTOR: Nothing special.  
FEMALE VOICE: (whispering) Save us, Doctor.  
THE DOCTOR: What about you?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I see ... water. Wells, cataracts, whirlpools.  
THE DOCTOR: Whirlpools. What does it mean?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I wish I knew, but they feel ominous. And the dream
lingers in my thinking long after I wake.  
  
THE DOCTOR: The first thing is to find out what happened to the Saints.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Precisely. And as you were closest to their work, you
are to investigate that as a matter of urgency.  
THE DOCTOR: But what about my work on Santiny?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I am to go in your place. Oh, is there anything
special I need to know? Let me see, erm, erm, erm erm, erm ... Sentin. Yes,
it's sun is Saeef, isn't it?  
THE DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: The Canisians have no doubt invaded by now, mm? And
you'll be seeding a rebellion, I suppose.  
THE DOCTOR: Exactly. I'll transmit the co-ordinates and contacts when you send
me yours.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Well then ... good luck, Doctor.  
THE DOCTOR: And to you. And be careful.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Oh, of what?  
THE DOCTOR: I don't know. Whirlpools?  
  
TRACK 8 - A CAREER IN MEDICINE  
  
PILOT: Come on, man. Talk!  
GOLCRUM: (gasp.) It was just like I said, General, sir. I was guarding the
girl and then ... the old man came and he - he just spoke to me and ... and I
- I did it. I-it was like ... it was like the voice of a God, General. He
spoke and I just had to do what he said. And he took the girl and ... and then
he vanished...  
GENERAL TANNIS: Another vanishing? This is becoming interesting. You didn't
think of anything original, like shooting him, then?  
GOLCRUM: I tried, General, but ... Sir, if I may say, you're looking awfully
tired. You ought to rest and drink lots of water.  
PILOT: Insolence! I'll have you shot!  
GENERAL TANNIS: No!  
PILOT: You...  
GENERAL TANNIS: No. No, Pilot. So you're worried about my health?  
GOLCRUM: Yes, sir. You seem agitated. I'll have your blood pressure checked if
I was you, sir. I could do it for you if you like, sir...  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh, you're very kind, soldier. You're very kind. Perhaps, you
would like to get away from all this beastly warfare and concentrate on curing
disease, hmm?  
GOLCRUM: Oh yes, sir. That would be very nice.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh, wouldn't it? I have the very place for you, soldier. There
is a planet called Anima Persis, where none of the diseases has a cure, except
that on Anima Persis, none of the diseases has a victim. The inhabitants died
long ago from the results of biochemical warfare. Legend has it that only
mutated monstrosities and the vengeful spirits of the dead remain - take him
away!  
(Cry of protest by GOLCRUM as he is led away.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: (sighs.) Pilot?  
PILOT: Yes, General?  
GENERAL TANNIS: I want to know what's going on. We can't fight an enemy we
can't see. Scan all our data sources for incidents of vanishings, flying
boxes, or anything else that might be unusual. I'll find whoever is behind
this. Time is the key, Pilot. That's the link.  
PILOT: Yes, General.  
(Door slides open and closed to indicate the PILOT leaving the room.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: And if I'm right, he won't be vanishing for much longer. After
all ... even Time Lords die.

TRACK 9 - WHERE TO NOW?  
  
(Tardis control room background.)  
ANTIMONY: What was all that about?  
THE DOCTOR: There's been a change of plan. We're not going back to Santiny, at
least not yet.  
ANTIMONY: Huh.  
THE DOCTOR: We have a murder to investigate.  
ANTIMONY: Is that where we're going?  
THE DOCTOR: Yes. Earth.  
  
EPISODE TWO: PLANET OF BLOOD  
  
TRACK 10 - VALENTINE'S DAY  
(Classical music playing, a woman singing the operatic aria. But not the same
tune as the online version. A faint noise is heard.)  
SAINT VALENTINE: Hello? Is someone there?  
(The classical music is turned off.)  
SAINT VALENTINE: Hello? You can come out. I know you're there. I won't hurt
you.  
(NESSICAN has a slightly electronically-treated voice.)  
NESSICAN: No, Time Lord. But I will hurt _you_ .  
SAINT VALENTINE: I see. Then you hurt yourself.  
NESSICAN: There is a rent in Time. What is the cause?  
SAINT VALENTINE: (laugh) You hardly seem the type to be concerned about the
fate of the universe. I don't know who you are or why you ask, but if I knew I
wouldn't tell you.  
NESSICAN: Then you will die.  
SAINT VALENTINE: So be it. Oh? Why do you hesitate?  
NESSICAN: This is a trick. They say you have the power to destroy with a
thought. They say you can kill planets. Why will you not fight?  
SAINT VALENTINE: Because you're not my enemy.  
NESSICAN: You are a coward! Are you afraid?  
SAINT VALENTINE: Yes. Only the dead have no fear.  
(Swish of sword.)  
NESSICAN: If you do not kill me, then I will kill you, then I will kill your
companion.  
SAINT VALENTINE: So be it. There is nothing that would make me kill. If there
be blood on my sword, let it be my own.  
NESSICAN: (laugh) The Saints! What a waste. To possess such strength and never
use it.  
SAINT VALENTINE: To have it and not to use it, that is our strength.  
NESSICAN: Hah! There is no strength in death.  
(Thrust of sword. SAINT VALENTINE screams.)  
  
(Opening Doctor Who theme music, arranged by Nick Romero.)  
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Doctor Who. Death Comes To Time, by Colin Meek. Episode Two
- Planet Of Blood. Starring Sylvester McCoy as The Doctor.  
  
TRACK 11 - OUT OF TIME, OUT OF PLACE  
  
(Tardis materialises. Click of opening door.)  
THE DOCTOR: No, you have to stop seeing Time as something separate from your
place in it. You're part of it. You can't be in two aspects of the same time
at once because you are part of that time. Reality is crystallised by a
consciousness impinged on an uncollapsed quantum wave. But once your
consciousness has impinged on one time line, it can't impinge on another.  
ANTIMONY: Oh, right. That explains everything.  
THE DOCTOR: Listen.  
ANTIMONY: I can't hear anything.  
THE DOCTOR: You should, though. It's as if there were a large predator.  
ANTIMONY: Well, you're in luck, Doctor, because I was doing some reading about
Earth, and it turns out it has some of the largest carnivores of any known
world.  
THE DOCTOR: Here? No.  
ANTIMONY: Oh yes, _indubitably_ , Doctor. There's one called an allosaurus
that's absolutely huge, and I think this fence is _indubitably_ to keep them
out.  
THE DOCTOR: Allosaurus? I think I nearly got eaten by one of them once.  
ANTIMONY: You think? I think you're losing your marbles, Doctor. If I'd seen
one I'd remember.  
THE DOCTOR: Well, time travel's confusing. I remember tomorrow like it was
yesterday.  
ANTIMONY: Doctor?  
THE DOCTOR: Yes?  
ANTIMONY: What does "indubitably" mean?  
  
THE DOCTOR: This is astronomical data. It's an analysis centre for radio
telescopes, I think.  
ANTIMONY: What gets me is, if they're really that big and fierce, how come
there are any humans at all? If I was a human I'd just think, well, here are
the dinosaurs, very pretty and all that, but not the ideal environment to live
in, quite frankly. I'd move to another planet, then come back dinosaur
watching with me friends and family...  
THE DOCTOR: This is strange data.  
ANTIMONY: Probably not small children, though. Might get scared. Or eaten.  
(As THE DOCTOR speaks, a door opens)  
THE DOCTOR: Hmm. Look at Cygnus, it's out of position.  
(Female DR CAIN - who is Doctor Cane in the online version.)  
DR CAIN: Excuse me. What are you doing here?  
THE DOCTOR: I'm being fascinated by these readings. Did you collect this data?  
DR CAIN: But ... this isn't open to you. How did you get in here?  
THE DOCTOR: Through there. Forgive us. We were in a hurry. Erm, we came to
find out about two people who died. We're family.  
DR CAIN: But ... you can't just break in. You say you're family? You knew them
well?  
THE DOCTOR: Yes. Can you tell me how they died?  
DR CAIN: You should have been contacted by the police yesterday morning.  
THE DOCTOR: We live a long way away. We came as soon as we heard.  
DR CAIN: Doctor Valentine was I'm afraid attacked by an animal in the research
library on the other side of the campus, then perhaps an hour later, the same
animal killed Professor Antenor. It's all fenced off. They died very quickly
if that's any help. Why do you ask?  
THE DOCTOR: Animal? What sort of animal?  
DR CAIN: A dog perhaps, or a large cat escaped from the zoo. They were ...
well, bitten. But they don't seem to have suffered, and that surely is the
main thing.  
ANTIMONY: I bet it was an allosaurus.  
THE DOCTOR: And there was no trace of the animal?  
DR CAIN: None. Gone for good, I think. They searched the grounds - nothing.
Were you close to them?  
THE DOCTOR: We were ... related. What was Professor Antenor doing before he
died? I mean, what were they working on before it happened?  
DR CAIN: Do you think that has anything to do with it?  
THE DOCTOR: Yes.  
DR CAIN: Well ... I'm Doctor Cain, by the way. You have my sympathies. If
there's anything I can do to help, just let me know.  
THE DOCTOR: Thank you. I'd like to look at this data. Could you show Antimony
here where Valentine died?  
DR CAIN: Oh, I - I couldn't. It's been taped off by the police.  
ANTIMONY: Oh, don't you worry, Doctor Cain. I can get through tape. I'll see
you back here, Doctor.  
THE DOCTOR: Keep your eyes peeled. They were murdered for what they knew, or
were about to find out.  
  
NESSICAN: Encrypt. Compressed super-luminal transmission. This is Nessican.
Here is my report. Both of the Time Lords have been eliminated. They had
discovered the temporal distortions, but would not disclose their source, if
they ever knew it. I do not know the cause of the distortions but neither will
anybody else. However, I have made a fortuitous discovery which will interest
you greatly. This planet is...  
(Voice fades.)  
  
TRACK 12 - SON OF TARDIS  
  
DR CAIN: Wait, please, you can't go in there.  
ANTIMONY: It's all right, Doctor Cain, I won't be long. We're here to help. We
just want to find out what happened.  
DR CAIN: Look, I'm very sorry about what happened to your friends. Did they
have any other relatives who might have been contacted?  
ANTIMONY: Don't think so. Not that I know of, Doctor Cain. Very nice of you to
ask, though.  
DR CAIN: Oh. It's the least I could do.  
ANTIMONY: Is this it?  
DR CAIN: Yes. This is the Research Library. I really don't think you'll find
anything useful from here. What sort of information are you looking for?  
(Door click.)  
ANTIMONY: Well, it must have been left open. Erm - no idea. No idea at all.  
(Footsteps.)  
ANTIMONY: There's someone coming. Doctor Cain? Doctor Cain.  
CAMPION: I was sure I heard something.  
SPEEDWELL: Well, well.  
CAMPION: Good evening, sir. Bit late for research, isn't it?  
ANTIMONY: I ... Oh.  
  
CAMPION: What do you think you're doing here, Sunshine? This is a cordoned
area.  
ANTIMONY: Is it?  
CAMPION: Is it, he says, Guv. What do I look like to you?  
ANTIMONY: Well, you look like a human but with a much bigger stomach.  
CAMPION: Are you trying to be clever?  
ANTIMONY: No. Well, I would if I thought it would work, but I - I don't think
it would. I don't know how to be clever, really.  
CAMPION: Listen, laughing boy, you're in a lot of bother...  
SPEEDWELL: All right, Campion. Now, would you like to tell us your name, sir?  
ANTIMONY: Antimony.  
CAMPION: Your full name?  
ANTIMONY: That is my full name.  
CAMPION: You lippy little...  
SPEEDWELL: Campion! Come on now, lad. You must have a surname.  
ANTIMONY: Oh yeah, I must. Yes, it's ... Tardis.  
CAMPION: And what's that? Greek?  
ANTIMONY: Erm ... A bit, yes.  
CAMPION: Oh, only me Mum's Greek, and ... Sorry, Guv. Carry on.  
SPEEDWELL: You're too kind. Right, Mister Tardis. You know why you're here,
don't you? You were found poking round a crime scene where a murder took
place. It was clearly taped off, and my colleague and I were wondering why you
were here at this hour.  
ANTIMONY: Well, er, you know...  
CAMPION/SPEEDWELL: No.  
ANTIMONY: I came to see the ... dinosaurs.  
CAMPION: Dinosaurs?  
ANTIMONY: Yes. I mean, yes. The Doctor told me about this planet, and he said
that...  
CAMPION: Doctor. Right.  
SPEEDWELL: Did he now? Did he? And whereabouts do you live? Where do you come
from, Mister Tardis?  
ANTIMONY: Er, London.  
CAMPION: This is London.  
ANTIMONY: A small hamlet in London you wouldn't have heard of.  
SPEEDWELL: Try me. I know the hamlets of London quite well.  
ANTIMONY: Oh. It's called, erm, it's called Green Village.  
SPEEDWELL: Oh, I know it well. That's the one with the big green gnome in the
main square, isn't it?  
ANTIMONY: Yes, yes, that's it, yes. Oh, how I miss the green gnome of my home
being there.  
SPEEDWELL: So, other than seeing our abundant dinosaurs, Mister Tardis, why
did your Doctor bring you here at this hour?  
ANTIMONY: Erm ... well, we had a problem with our vehicle - our automobile.  
SPEEDWELL: Did you? Yes, automobiles can be tricky, can't they?  
ANTIMONY: Oh, yes, yes, yes.  
SPEEDWELL: What exactly was wrong with the automobile?  
ANTIMONY: The view-screen was broken.  
SPEEDWELL: Right, yes, oh dear oh dear, cost you an arm and a leg to get that
fixed.  
ANTIMONY: Won't, will it?  
CAMPION: Guv?  
(Door closed.)  
SPEEDWELL: Gordon Bennett, some mothers, eh?  
CAMPION: What's he on? He's like a kid or something. And what's wrong with his
eyes?  
SPEEDWELL: Well, there might be something in this Doctor thingies, he may have
just wandered out of some nut-house. Look, you get on the blower and get a
shrink down here to talk to him. Probably nothing, but best to be sure.  
CAP: Right, Guv.  
(Door opened.)  
SPEEDWELL: Mister Tardis, one thing - you said there was a Doctor with you.  
ANTIMONY: Yes. There was Doctor Cain with me here but she disappeared
suddenly, no idea where she's gone. And then of course there's _the_ Doctor.  
SPEEDWELL: Well, I think we'd better go and find him, don't you?  
  
ANTIMONY: Doctor, a strange man to see you.  
THE DOCTOR: Mm?  
SPEEDWELL: Evening, sir.  
THE DOCTOR: Hello.  
SPEEDWELL: Would you be this young gentleman's Doctor?  
THE DOCTOR: Shh! Just a moment. This is extraordinary. This is extraordinary.  
SPEEDWELL: What's extraordinary, sir?  
THE DOCTOR: This data. The level of X-rays this telescope has been picking up
are enormous. There are new black holes forming, and the existing ones are
expanding at an alarming rate.  
SPEEDWELL: Is that a bad thing, sir?  
THE DOCTOR: Yes, it's a bad thing. There's a tear in the fabric of Time.  
SPEEDWELL: Really, sir? That sounds a bit drastic.  
THE DOCTOR: It's worse than drastic, it's ... quite bad. But it's what caused
it that bothers me.  
SPEEDWELL: And what did cause it, sir?  
THE DOCTOR: I don't know. If I wasn't me, I'd be the prime suspect.  
SPEEDWELL: Oh yes, sir? Well, you can hardly arrest yourself. Would this
information be worth killing two people for, sir? Is it the sort of thing
someone would want to cover up?  
THE DOCTOR: Possibly. Wait. So you think they were murdered? You don't think
it was an escaped animal?  
SPEEDWELL: I find it somewhat puzzling, I must say. Two people being attacked
by an animal with no blood and no trace of that animal left in the space of an
hour in different places. Call me a sceptic, but that sort of thing appeals to
my cynical side, sir.  
THE DOCTOR: Oh. Mm. Now, the thing to do is ... Wait a minute. Who are you?  
SPEEDWELL: Oh, how rude of me. I do apologise, sir. I didn't mean to interrupt
your tampering with the crime scene. Name's Speedwell. I'm merely the
investigating officer. Now Doctor, if it wouldn't interfere with your
schedule, perhaps your Highness would like to tell me what you're doing here,
what you're a Doctor of, and what your patient is doing wandering around a
cordoned area at three in the morning before I lock you _both_ up!  
(Static. Female voice on walkie-talkie radio.)  
RADIO: Base to Speedwell. Over.  
SPEEDWELL: Go ahead. Over.  
RADIO: Officer reports a possible animal attack in progress in the East End.
Police Officer is on the way to investigate. Over.  
SPEEDWELL: On my way. Over. You two stay here.  
THE DOCTOR: Let me come with you. I can help.  
SPEEDWELL: All right. But he stays.  
ANTIMONY: Oh, what? Now, Doctor...  
SPEEDWELL: I'll have to handcuff you till Campion gets here. He'll only be a
few minutes.  
(Handcuffs used.)  
ANTIMONY: What?  
THE DOCTOR: All right, Antimony.  
ANTIMONY: Oh...  
THE DOCTOR: Come on, it's important. Only a few minutes. You stay here, keep
watch and be careful.  
ANTIMONY: (laugh) Yeah, of what?  
  
TRACK 13 - BAD DREAMS  
  
(Echoed voices of a dream.)  
ACE: What is this?  
MALE VOICE: The Edge.  
ACE: We're too close. Stop rowing.  
MALE VOICE: I can't.  
ACE: There's someone behind you.  
(Water flowing.)  
  
TRACK 14 - HORROR IN THE CITY  
  
SPEEDWELL: Where are you going, Constable? Did you radio in the incident?  
NESSICAN: Yes, sir. Down that alley there.  
SPEEDWELL: Right, show us.  
NESSICAN: If it's all the same to you sir, I'd rather stay here. I am a bit
squeamish.  
SPEEDWELL: Squeamish? Squeamish, but ... Oh, I don't beli... All right.  
(Down the alley.)  
SPEEDWELL: Gordon Bennett, what's happened to her skin?  
THE DOCTOR: Nothing. She's been drained. Take a closer look at the neck. What
do you make of these marks?  
SPEEDWELL: Oh, Lord. Well, I know what they look like.  
THE DOCTOR: They look like what they are.  
SPEEDWELL: But ... (Spluttering) Oh, God!  
THE DOCTOR: Very dangerous. She's a young female, so he's probably an adult
male. That's how they work.  
SPEEDWELL: Do you think it's ... I don't know ... some sort of psychotic, a
... a - a cannibal?  
THE DOCTOR: Wait. She's not been completely drained. I mean, look at these
marks. He was disturbed in the act, then there was a struggle. Look, there's
more blood over there - there, look, look, another body.  
SPEEDWELL: Oh no. I know this man, he's a policeman.  
THE DOCTOR: Yes. He disturbed the killer in the act.  
SPEEDWELL: His clothes?  
THE DOCTOR: The policeman who directed us in here - do you know him?  
SPEEDWELL: No. Damn it!  
THE DOCTOR: He'll head for the dark.  
  
SPEEDWELL: Bugger. Nothing. Excuse my French. He was talking to me like
nothing had happened, bold as brass. Are you sure it was our killer?  
THE DOCTOR: Oh yes. They're experts at blending in. That's how they hunt. They
weave their way into confidences like a cat. If you're that used to deception,
you can seem like anything you like..  
SPEEDWELL: You seem to know a great deal about...  
POLICEMAN: (radio) Base to Speedwell. Over.  
SPEEDWELL: Speedwell. Go ahead.  
POLICEMAN: (radio) We've got another disturbance report from near the
university. We intercepted a woman reporting screams, and an animal attack.  
(Police car siren approaching.)  
SPEEDWELL: That can't be him. How the blazes could he get there so quickly?  
THE DOCTOR: I don't know.  
SPEEDWELL: Base? On my way.  
POLICEMAN: Reporting as ordered, sir.  
SPEEDWELL: There's a murder victim in that alley. We've got to check out
another report. You two, have a look around this area in case.  
POLICEMAN 1: Sir.  
POLICEMAN 2: Sir.  
THE DOCTOR: Look in dark places. And be careful. He's extremely dangerous.  
POLICEMAN 2: Sir?  
SPEEDWELL: Do as he says. Base? This is Speedwell. Can you ask Campion to let
me know when he's got...?  
POLICEMAN: (radio) Campion? Isn't he with you?  
SPEEDWELL: No. Then where is he?  
  
ANTIMONY: Come on.  
(Movement.)  
ANTIMONY: Hello? Hello, anyone there? Hello? Hang on.  
(CAMPION groans.)  
ANTIMONY: Mister Campion. What ... what happened?  
CAMPION: Key.  
(Handcuffs unlocked.)  
ANTIMONY: Here. Try to press this on, stop the bleeding. I'm going to get
help. Mister Campion?  
CAMPION: (groans.) Quite strong...  
  
TRACK 15 - ELIMINATE THE POSSIBLE  
  
SPEEDWELL: Base? This is Speedwell. Over.  
POLICEWOMAN: (radio) Go ahead, Speedwell. Over.  
SPEEDWELL: Get as many ambulances as you can to the Blues Bar near the
university. We've got at least twenty casualties. It's an absolute massacre.  
THE DOCTOR: You don't need ambulances.  
SPEEDWELL: It's just like the others.  
THE DOCTOR: No it isn't. Their throats haven been ripped out, but the blood
hasn't been drunk.  
SPEEDWELL: Drunk? Oh, God. How can you? Who would do this? What sort of
creature?  
THE DOCTOR: I think you know what sort of creature. The question is, what is
this for? This is like some sort of display. The girl was killed for food, but
these have been killed for what? Their bloodthirstiness? But then, why so
openly?  
(Glass smashes.)  
THE DOCTOR: He's still here. I'll take the front, you take the back, quickly.  
SPEEDWELL: Right.  
  
(Out of breath.)  
SPEEDWELL: Ah, lost him. Are you all right, Doctor?  
THE DOCTOR: Yes. Give me a moment. Oh, not as young as I was. Mind you, I
never was.  
SPEEDWELL: Patrol, this is Speedwell.  
(Static on radio.)  
SPEEDWELL: Any sign of anything around the crime scene?  
POLICEMAN: (radio) We have a sighting of a man covered in blood by the owner
of a twenty-four hour grocery, two streets from the alley. We're inve...  
(Static.)  
SPEEDWELL: Patrol? Patrol!  
THE DOCTOR: It's him.  
SPEEDWELL: It can't be him. Why would he go back there? He couldn't possibly
make it back there in that time.  
THE DOCTOR: When you eliminate the possible, what remains however improbable
is usually what I've just said. Come on!  
SPEEDWELL: Surely no animal could do that at that speed then get back to
Whitechapel.  
THE DOCTOR: Speedwell, it's not an animal.  
SPEEDWELL: I know it's not, Doctor. I know it's not.  
  
TRACK 16 - BREAKFAST WITH MIDAS  
  
(Cat mews.)  
CASMUS: Wake up. The sun is halfway into the morning.  
ACE: I am up. I need rest. I think you frog-marching me around yesterday
opened up my wounds.  
CASMUS: You'll feel stiff for a while, but your injuries are fading. Here.
This plant is called Knitbone. It has excellent healing properties. You would
be wise to learn to recognise the family. You'll find plants similar to it on
most planets.  
(Drinking.)  
ACE: Eugh! It's like eating a swamp.  
(CASMUS laughs. Mew of cat.)  
ACE: Hello there, Midas. Aren't you sweet? Oh. This stuff's quite nice, you
know. For slime, that is.  
CASMUS: (laugh, then) Is something wrong?  
ACE: No. I don't know. I had a sort of nightmare. I think I was in a boat,
being rowed, into a whirlpool. I never usually remember my dreams.  
CASMUS: Yes. Your mind is opening to reality. You must try to remember your
dreams from now on. They are perceptions uncluttered by shadows of matter.  
ACE: Mine are usually useless and the details are all wrong.  
CASMUS: The truth is rarely in the minutiae. In the grand scheme of things,
the scheme is the thing.  
ACE: I just end up with my trousers down in a classroom.  
CASMUS: Now, come. Time is against us. Soon we must leave here.  
ACE: And go where?  
CASMUS: To Mount Plutarch. There you will meet the Kingmaker, and your
abilities will be tested.  
ACE: Tested? Oh, you're joking, I don't know anything yet.  
CASMUS: (laughs.) Remember that, Midas. She doesn't know anything. You do not
require information. You need only see the universe as it is, and - you will
continue to learn long after I am gone. Knowledge is a door that once opened,
can never be closed. Now, we will stay here tonight, and in the morning, we
will ascend.  
ACE: It was a bad dream. Really bad.  
CASMUS: Tell me, who was rowing the boat?  
ACE: I don't know. I didn't recognise him. I sort of ... felt him. If this
makes sense, he seemed friendly, but dangerous.  
  
TRACK 17 - A COMMON FRIEND  
  
(Marching.)  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Halt. This is as clean as we'll get in this festering mud-bath.
We'll stop here. Secure the perimeter, set up for a scan. Lieutenant Suneel,
signal base.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Santiny Base Four from tracking platoon. This is Lieutenant
Suneel. We are approximately fourteen miles east of you. The area is clear of
guerrilla activity. We're stopping to make scans.  
MALE VOICE: (communicator) Acknowledged, tracking platoon.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Canis rising. Captain Carne, with all due respect to your
strategic genius, this seems a slightly exposed spot to set up the scanner.
They could come out of the trees. Why don't we make for that hilltop? We'd be
less vulnerable to an ambush.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: And expose ourselves to air attack? You fool. I'd be shot for
incompetence.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: But sir, the resistance don't have aircraft, do they?
There's no way a vehicle could get past our radar.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: That's enough. There are two things I will not tolerate. Lack
of hygiene and insubordination. Are you questioning my orders again, Suneel?  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: No Captain, it's just that I...  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Listen. What's that?  
(Faint Tardis materialisation.)  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Quiet. Take cover. You. Yes, you. Go and see what it is.  
  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: What a forest. What a fragrant emerald. You know, I
think these trees are a species of sequoia, but I've never seen ones this big,
they must be what, two, three thousand years old? Think of the complexity, the
tiny universes in each leaf. All that life, all this pristine beauty, and all
you can do is crawl around in the undergrowth waving guns. Er, incidentally -
I don't have a gun, so why don't you come out, shake hands, and we can all be
best enemies, mm?  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Raise your hands.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Suneel, this honey-tongued native may be armed. Check his
pockets.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Just these cubes.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Don't give them to me, man. They may be diseased. What are
they?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Quantum dice. The sort of thing the other children
played with while you were being harshly potty-trained.  
(Gasp.)  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Identify yourself.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I'm the Minister. I've come to help the resistance. As
I said, I'm unarmed so if you could get the shouting over with, arrest me and
take me to your leader we might save some time.  
(Gasp.)  
CAPTAIN CARNE: That's enough, Lieutenant.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Thank you.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Inform Parsus base that we have captured a guerrilla. A
particularly smug one at that.  
(Guns prepared for firing.)  
SENATOR SALA: Cancel that order, Lieutenant.  
SENATOR HAWK: Drop your weapons. Don't make me shoot you, young man.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Open fire!  
(Shots. Machine guns, explosions.)  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Suneel! You insubordinate fool. Why did you give the order to
fire?  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Sir, that's Sala and Hawk, reputedly the leaders of the
resistance. We can't let this opportunity to kill them slip, sir.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: That's enough. I give the orders here. Look at the view \- we
are crawling around in this filthy forest being murdered by a bunch of natives
instead of completing our scan.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: But sir, with respect...  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Quiet! I'll have you shot! Because of your rank insubordination
you will provide covering fire whilst we withdraw. Withdraw. Fall back.  
(Shots continue.)  
SENATOR HAWK: Cease fire, cease fire, they're withdrawing. Are you injured,
young man?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Well, I ... I fear in my courageous dive for the
nearest bush I've lost nothing but ... face.  
SENATOR SALA: Don't worry. Any enemy of the Canisians is...  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: What? A mammal?  
SENATOR SALA: (laugh.) What are you doing here?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Well, I was looking for you unless I'm much mistaken.  
SENATOR HAWK: How did you know where we were?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I didn't. I merely divined where you were most likely
to be.  
SENATOR SALA: Have you come to fight with the resistance?  
SENATOR HAWK: Hiding in the bushes, kill people, he'd be a great fighter.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Er, quite. I had something rather more radical in
mind, actually, if ... if you will entertain suggestions?  
SENATOR SALA: Come. We should leave. Tell me as we walk. I'm Sala.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I'm the Minister. I believe we have a friend in
common.  
  
TRACK 18 - SHOPPING  
  
(Police siren.)  
POLICEWOMAN: (radio) Repeat. We have a report of disturbance in your area.
Please confirm.  
SPEEDWELL: The patrol is down. Over.  
(Siren stopped.)  
SPEEDWELL: Base, patrol is down. Two officers dead. Doctor, what are you doing
in there?  
THE DOCTOR: Shopping. This man's dead too. Neck's broken.  
SPEEDWELL: One civilian in the twenty-four hour shop, also dead. Stand by. The
world's gone mad in one night.  
THE DOCTOR: There's something wrong here. This assassin came here to kill the
two at the university, then I see two patterns. One is that of a hunter who
kills to eat. That explains the girl in the alley. But I think the massacre
was for us to see.  
SPEEDWELL: To scare us?  
THE DOCTOR: No. I think he knows by now that we would be scared off. It's to
attract our attention.  
SPEEDWELL: You think he wants us to catch him?  
THE DOCTOR: I think part of him wants us to catch him.  
SPEEDWELL: Well, let's oblige. Where would he go?  
THE DOCTOR: He'll go to ground, to cold, to darkness. They're creatures of
habit.  
SPEEDWELL: What's that smell?  
THE DOCTOR: There. Where does that go?  
(Moving cover aside.)  
SPEEDWELL: Oh no. In my new trousers? The wife will have my guts for garters.  
(Moving in tunnel.)  
THE DOCTOR: Come on. This is where he went.  
SPEEDWELL: Are you sure?  
THE DOCTOR: Either that, or he'll return to the scene of a kill. But I don't
think so now, not this one.  
  
TRACK 19 - INTERSPECIES COMMUNICATION  
  
(Door opened.)  
DR CAIN: Oh no. How dreadful. That poor man.  
ANTIMONY: Yeah it was. I just found him here dying. It was horrible. He was
sort of coughing blood.  
DR CAIN: Who is he?  
ANTIMONY: His name's Campion. He was one of the policemen who I met in the
research library. What happened to you? You disappeared.  
DR CAIN: I didn't want to get caught helping you into the crime scene. I'd
have lost my job. Did you find the answers you were looking for?  
ANTIMONY: No, I didn't have time.  
AN: Oh well, that's a shame. I'm sure you will. Just have to wait. Well, I
suppose we should cover him up.  
ANTIMONY: Why? He can't get cold now.  
DR CAIN: You're strange, you know.  
ANTIMONY: Yes, I know.  
DR CAIN: You don't smell of anything. Everyone has a scent, you know. You
haven't got one, though.  
ANTIMONY: Haven't I? Is that a bad thing?  
DR CAIN: I don't know. Bad things aren't necessarily bad things, if you see
what I mean.  
ANTIMONY: Erm - no, not really.  
DR CAIN: Well, some would say that these people are the victims, and whatever
killed them was the villain. But look at us. We're so ... base. Look at how we
reproduce. All we do is pass on genetic material. Surely it's more civilised
to pass on your ideas?  
ANTIMONY: Sounds reasonable.  
DR CAIN: To choose who you wish to be your heir, to make them like you and
then to teach them all that you know. The soul of what they are goes on. That
is the civilised reasonable way, surely?  
ANTIMONY: Well, it sounds reasonable when you put it like that. Except it
doesn't mean they deserve to be killed because they reproduce in a silly way.  
DR CAIN: But sometimes surely, some races are meant to hunt, and some are
meant to be hunted. I mean, lions are meant to eat antelopes. It must be
normal and natural for something to eat humans. It must be.  
ANTIMONY: I wouldn't know. But you can't expect the ones who are hunted to
give in, can you? They can't just let things eat them.  
DR CAIN: Why not?  
ANTIMONY: I don't know. It's just how things are, I suppose.  
DR CAIN: It's all so exhausting.  
  
THE DOCTOR: He must be tired. He must go to ground now, he must.  
SPEEDWELL: This wouldn't be my first choice for a snooze, I must say, Doctor.  
THE DOCTOR: Shh! He's around here.  
SPEEDWELL: Can you see him?  
THE DOCTOR: No, but I can feel the air currents. And look at the way the
water's flowing.  
(Growl.)  
SPEEDWELL: You, stop. Stop or I'll fire!  
THE DOCTOR: Be careful. Remember what he's capable of.  
SPEEDWELL: Stand back, Doctor. I'll handle this.  
NESSICAN: Doctor. So you're the Doctor. You don't look like the most
powerful...  
THE DOCTOR: You're Nessican.  
SPEEDWELL: Do you know this man, Doctor?  
THE DOCTOR: I know of him. An assassin. Tell me Nessican. Why? Who's behind
this?  
NESSICAN: You don't know, Time Lord? Then you'll only know when it's too late.  
THE DOCTOR: You know I can't let you go.  
NESSICAN: Let me go? You want me to go back to a prison on a phantom sun?  
THE DOCTOR: You were sent to kill Antenor and Valentine. Why the carnage in
that bar? I mean, why did you massacre all those humans?  
NESSICAN: I am not an animal, Time Lord, although you persecute us. I kill
only to feed or be fed. I do not massacre!  
SPEEDWELL: That's hardly mitigating circumstances, sir, you'll have to come
with me.  
NESSICAN: Come to me, come to my touchy soft and easy. No more pain.  
SPEEDWELL: Doctor, I'm afraid I can't move!  
THE DOCTOR: Don't - don't let him. Concentrate now, concentrate on something.
On the water.  
NESSICAN: Ware, Time Lord.  
THE DOCTOR: Look at the water, Speedwell. Its cold. Can't you see? Don't let
him have your mind!  
(Gunshots, ricochets.)  
NESSICAN: That will only slow your death, human, not mine.  
(THE DOCTOR gasps.)  
SPEEDWELL: Doctor.  
THE DOCTOR: No. Don't bite me. I don't want to die.  
(NESSICAN roars, bites. NESSICAN cries out.)  
THE DOCTOR: I told you not to.  
NESSICAN: You don't know, Doctor. You don't know.  
SPEEDWELL: Are you all right?  
THE DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I can bandage it. Since when do the police here carry
guns?  
SPEEDWELL: Since when did doctors hunt vampires? What did you do to him?  
THE DOCTOR: I poisoned him.  
SPEEDWELL: Poisoned? With what?  
THE DOCTOR: My blood. I ate this. I got it from the shop. Quite tasty,
actually. Iron is a systemic poison to his species. Bullets won't harm them
unless they sever the spinal cord.  
SPEEDWELL: Now you tell me. Here. What's this?  
THE DOCTOR: Let me see. It's a transmitter. Presumably to contact whoever
ordered this, and that's what we still don't know.  
POLICEMAN: (radio) Base to Speedwell. Over.  
SPEEDWELL: Receiving. Over.  
POLICEMAN: (radio) We have a description of a perpetrator from a witness at
the Blues Bar.  
SPEEDWELL: You're a bit late, lad, we've just killed him.  
POLICEMAN: (radio) Him? Our witness described a female.  
SPEEDWELL: Must be a mistake. Over. This one's got long hair, mind you.  
THE DOCTOR: No! I'm an idiot. There are two of them. That explains the two
patterns. They assassinated Antenor and Valentine, then Nessican feeds on the
girl, gets nearly caught and escapes, and the other one, the other one is
leading us a dance.  
SPEEDWELL: Have you got a description of her?  
POLICEMAN: (radio) Blonde, thirties, probably blue-eyes.  
  
TRACK 20 - SAVING DR CAIN  
  
ANTIMONY: Doctor Cain. What are you doing?  
DR CAIN: I'm just clearing up.  
ANTIMONY: Isn't that the data the Doctor was looking at?  
DR CAIN: Is it? What were you going to ask me?  
ANTIMONY: If Mister Campion wasn't attacked very long ago, it means the
Doctor's looking in the wrong place. Or, the killer was here.  
DR CAIN: Well, what does it matter? I mean, as they say, at least he's at
peace.  
ANTIMONY: You aren't, are you?  
DR CAIN: You're a strange boy. You're naive and clever at the same time.  
(DR CAIN with different voice like NESSICAN's.)  
ANTIMONY: Why did you kill them?  
DR CAIN: Because I have to.  
ANTIMONY: But why? Can't you stop?  
DR CAIN: I was born a killer. That's what I am.  
ANTIMONY: Surely you can change.  
DR CAIN: I've killed more humans than I can count. I convinced myself that I
was superior to them anyway, that they deserved it, and I don't think I can
lie any more. I'm sick of you all, and I'm sick of myself.  
ANTIMONY: (gasp.) Why - why can't I move?  
DR CAIN: I'm sorry. We hypnotise our prey sometimes.  
ANTIMONY: Prey? But don't you have to have a watch to hypnoti...?  
(Swish of sword.)  
ANTIMONY: Wait a minute, look, you don't _have_ to be a killer.  
DR CAIN: They're usually much more afraid than you are, brave boy.  
ANTIMONY: But look, the Doctor will know what to do. He - he - he'll be able
to help you.  
DR CAIN: I think he probably will. But he won't be able to help _you_ , brave
boy.  
(Crashing of door.)  
ANTIMONY: Doctor, it was her.  
SPEEDWELL: Campion. Oh no!  
THE DOCTOR: Leave the boy. It's me you want, isn't it? You don't want this any
more. I know you want this to stop.  
DR CAIN: Yes, stop it, come on then, Doctor. Kill me if you can.  
THE DOCTOR: No! There has been enough killing!  
DR CAIN: It's a pity I can't do anything else.  
THE DOCTOR: No!  
(Shots. DR CAIN falls. Gasps.)  
DR CAIN: Good shot, human. Right through the spine.  
ANTIMONY: Doctor Cain. You'll be all right.  
DR CAIN: Yes. I will.  
THE DOCTOR: Make some good come of this. What were you covering up?  
DR CAIN: Black holes. It's a Time Lord.  
THE DOCTOR: None of them are murderers. Who is it?  
DR CAIN: Not him.  
THE DOCTOR: Not who? (echoed) Who ... who ... who ... who...  
  
TRACK 21 - THE REPORT  
  
NESSICAN: Encrypt. Compressed super-luminal transmission. This is Nessican.
Here is my report. Both of the Time Lords have been eliminated. They had
discovered the temporal distortions, but would not disclose their source, if
they ever knew it. I do not know the cause of the distortions but neither will
anybody else. However, I have made a fortuitous discovery which will interest
you greatly. This planet is the richest prize that either Cain or I ever
foreseen, with abundant water, resources and raw materials, so much so, that
every continent is populated by many tribes, all on the same planet. I do not
wonder that the Time Lords decided to hide themselves away here. It is very
peaceful. Furthermore, because it is so remote, it has no contact with other
worlds and therefore no planetary defences. Even compared with Santiny it
would be a walkover. A pity. Under the circumstances, it seems a place where
one could ... live. I'm going to find Cain and get something to eat. Nessican
out.  
(Bleeps.)  
COMPUTER: Canis Central. This message is virus free.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Hmm. Very interesting. A hidden jewel. We must pay it a visit.  
(Door opened. Sound of a crowd in the background.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: What?  
PILOT: Excuse me, General. Er, Premier Bedloe requests that you join him for
his address to the people.  
GENERAL TANNIS: I'll be there directly, Pilot.  
PILOT: Good news, General?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Mm? Oh, simply another iron in the fire, Pilot, just another
iron in the fire.

TRACK 22 - ANOTHER FRIEND IN COMMON  
  
(Walking.)  
SPEEDWELL: That sewer water ruined a good pair of trousers. The wife will have
my guts for garters. Well Doctor, it's been a privilege. I'm somewhat at a
loss, I must say, I'm ... trying to think what to tell them. Trying to think
what to tell myself, actually.  
THE DOCTOR: Tell yourself, you saved a lot of people.  
SPEEDWELL: It doesn't feel like that.  
THE DOCTOR: It never does. That's the way it is. The giants walk while the
people sleep. I've modified Nessican's transmitter. I'd like you to keep it.  
SPEEDWELL: That's very kind, Doctor. Do I need it?  
THE DOCTOR: Let's hope not. It's just a hunch. But it's as well to be
prepared.  
(Name scribbled onto card.)  
THE DOCTOR: Take it to this man. He'll know what to do with it. Oh - and give
him my regards.  
SPEEDWELL: I might venture to give him mine as well, Doctor. After all, he is
my boss.  
THE DOCTOR: (laugh) Of course, yes. Goodbye, Mister Speedwell.  
(Tardis dematerialises.)  
SPEEDWELL: It's Lieutenant-Colonel, actually.  
  
EPISODE THREE: THE PRISONER  
  
TRACK 1 - GLORY  
  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Captain Carne, the aliens we encountered yesterday in the
forest are here.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Aliens? Sound the alarm!  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: No, I mean the Santines, sir. There are only two of them.
The Minister fellow who we encountered, and he claims to have brought back
Senator Sala, as a prisoner.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: What? You down there. We have you covered. What do you want?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Well, I thought we might trade. I've brought you a
present.  
SENATOR SALA: Let go of me, you snake.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Sir, shouldn't we just go out and capture them both?  
CAPTAIN CARNE: No, no. It could be a trap.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: We do somewhat outnumber them, Captain.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Er, very well, bring them in.  
(Noise of door.)  
CAPTAIN CARNE: I've captured the head of the resistance. I'll make Major for
this. Lieutenant Suneel, put me through to General Tannis.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: What are we going to do with the Minister?  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Do with him? We're going to kill him.

TRACK 2 - THE DICTATOR'S SOCIETY  
  
(Military music playing. Cheering. Female voice of COMPUTER.)  
COMPUTER: Canis rising. Welcome to address us, beloved leader, Premier Bedloe.
Glory, glory.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: Fellow citizens of the mighty Alpha Canis, by now you - you
will have heard the news of yet another great victory, and you will feel the
joy that I feel. On Santiny too there is joy. Our liberation force was
welcomed by cheering crowds as a corrupt Santine President and his decadent
cohorts fled in terror. Join me now in - in welcoming home to the motherland
our beloved defender and conqueror of Santiny, General Tannis.  
(Cheering.)  
COMPUTER: Glory. Glory. Welcome to address us, First General Tannis, conqueror
of the Centauri system, of Alterre, of the Kaili and the Sallth. Glory.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Fellow Canisians, friends. Thank you. I am humbled by your
kindness, beloved leader. To your words I say only this. A simple people led
astray by terrorists have been brought under our wing, and into our glorious
family. Let us give thanks. Canis rising.  
(Cheering.)  
COMPUTER: Glory. Glory. Lecture is in one hour.  
  
COMPUTER: Please make your way to your home.  
GENERAL TANNIS: That should keep the rabble quiet.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: A brief but moving speech. You bring glory to us, General
Tannis. I must tell you on completion of your campaign we consider you greatly
eligible for promotion.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Promotion, beloved leader? How gratifying.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: General ... My dear General, you mock me.  
GENERAL TANNIS: If I wanted a promotion I would take it. In fact, if I want
anything from you I will take it.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: You forget yourself, General. I am in charge here.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Are you? I rather think that large chunks of space are now
mine.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: You ... you overstep the mark. And how dare you bring the
military into the city. It's expressly forbidden. No General may bring his
forces into the capital.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Calm yourself, beloved leader. They're not _in_ the city.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: Don't play your twisted games, Tannis. Your forces are camped
outside the city walls, expressly to threaten me and my leadership. You - you
... you're preparing a coup.  
GENERAL TANNIS: What would you do if I were? Complain to the Dictator Society?  
PREMIER BEDLOE: (spluttering) Insolence! I - I will not be defeated or
intimidated.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Well, almost. You won't be defeated because there won't be a
fight. I don't want to displace you as leader, I want you puppeting along
exactly where you are, allowing me to conquer the universe without having to
put up a friendly face.  
(PREMIER BEDLOE splutters.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: And you _will_ be intimidated because I have the loyalty of
the armies, and I can do what I like, and because you wouldn't want anything
to happen to your child.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: My ...? My children. Why, wh-wh-what have you...?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Not your children. Your child.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: What do you mean? But I have two children. Wh-what are you
talking about?  
GENERAL TANNIS: What am I talking about. Pilot, how many children does our
beloved leader have?  
PILOT: One, General.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: But ... I ... Oh, you - you couldn't. I - I don't believe you
would harm my children...  
GENERAL TANNIS: You don't? I rather think you should.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: But ... I...  
(Bleeps.)  
PILOT: Transmission for you from Santiny. General.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Excuse me, beloved leader. Oh, before I go, may I introduce
Major Bander. Come here, Major.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: But ... wh-wh-what is this?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Beloved leader, this is your new bodyguard, Major Bander.  
MAJOR BANDER: This is a great honour, beloved leader. I am at your disposal.  
GENERAL TANNIS: He'll be at your disposal. Oh, and he'll be the means of your
disposal if you don't behave. Pilot, you're with me.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: But ... but, wait, wait!  
(Door slides open.)  
PREMIER BEDLOE: Is my son alive?  
GENERAL TANNIS: I can't give away the ending.  
(Door slides closed.)  
  
TRACK 3 - OPPOSITES  
  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Lieutenant Suneel, you will prepare for the arrival of the
Fleet Pilot as my honoured guest. You ... You have a spot on your shirt!  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: If I might ask whether at any stage in your account of the
valiant capture of Senator Sala you'll be mentioning the Minister.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: No you may not ask! You are constantly questioning my command.
It's obvious he's an off-world freebooter who's managed to get onto the planet
under our noses. Do you know what General Tannis would do if he found out? I
have a brother in the blockade. It could be his head on the block.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: I bow to your wisdom, Captain.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Yes, yes. Take the woman out of the breaking cell and put her
back in the dungeon with the Minister. You are in personal charge of her. You
are not to leave the cell door until the Pilot gets here. I will be there to
evaluate this Minister character shortly.  
  
(Tardis control room background.)  
ANTIMONY: I like that Speedwell fellow, but that planet wasn't anything like
you described. Oh, are these the images from the telescope?  
THE DOCTOR: Yes.  
ANTIMONY: I quite like them. What are they?  
THE DOCTOR: Black holes.  
ANTIMONY: What's a black...?  
THE DOCTOR: Dead star. The gravity's so strong that not even light can escape.  
ANTIMONY: I don't understand why we're so worried about them.  
THE DOCTOR: Because the only thing that can make them grow like that is a Time
Lord misusing his abilities on a grand scale, and that ... well, that's
something we have to stop at any cost. I think the Saints were trying to track
down who it was.  
ANTIMONY: Couldn't it be the Minister? He seemed a bit weird.  
THE DOCTOR: For a Time Lord? Are you saying I seem normal?  
ANTIMONY: Well, you do to me, but that's 'cause I'm used to you. I'm sure to
most people you're just ridiculous and mad.  
THE DOCTOR: Remind me to teach you the concept of tact. Shouldn't take more
than a century. No, the Minister's one of ours, there's no evil in him. Now,
he'll be causing trouble for the Canisians on Santiny, and that should
distract Tannis. I don't know what Tannis' involvement is, but I'm going to
stop it.  
(Scanner operated.)  
THE DOCTOR: While the cat's away the mice are going to engineer a coup on
Alpha Canis One.  
ANTIMONY: Great. I like mice. You know what these pictures look like to me?  
THE DOCTOR: Mm?  
ANTIMONY: Whirlpools.  
THE DOCTOR: Hmm.  
  
TRACK 4 - THE MINISTER'S GIFT  
  
(Echoed voices of a dream.)  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Where am I?  
MALE 1: On the Edge.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I don't want to be here. Why am I here?  
MALE 2: Save us!  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: It's not me. There's someone behind you.  
MALE 2: Save us!  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Stop pushing me. Why am I here.  
(Thunder.)  
  
(THE MINISTER OF CHANCE wakes up.)  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Why am I here?  
(Door slides open.)  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: You. Wake up. Get away from the cell door. Further, right
to the other side.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I was ... I was rather enjoying the delights of that
side...  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: We've finished with your girlfriend for the time being.  
(Body falls in.)  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: What have you done to her?  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: She'll live, you won't. You're scheduled for execution.
Enjoy your remaining time together.  
(Door closed.)  
SENATOR SALA: I'm all right. I can manage.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Here, here, take my coat. Erm - lie down here.
Animals. Unbelievable barbarians! Would it, would it be possible for you
people to go for five minutes without committing an atrocity!  
SENATOR SALA: I'll live.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: What can this sort of degradation possibly achieve?  
SENATOR SALA: Hey, calm down. I am the one that was tortured. What's wrong
with you suddenly?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Well, I ... Oh, now you're wrist is broken.  
SENATOR SALA: If we can find that prison camp it will be worth it.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I'm afraid it was necessary to let them take you...  
SENATOR SALA: Enough. There was nothing you could do. Stop whimpering like a
woman. I will be fine.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Erm - look away.  
SENATOR SALA: What?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: You can't travel far with a broken wrist, can you?
Now, just - look away.  
(Humming. SENATOR SALA gasps.)  
SENATOR SALA: How did you do that? Can you do it here too?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: No. It's - something to be used sparingly. Now, we
must act quickly. Erm - you think the prison camp is at Luria, yes?  
SENATOR SALA: That's where we think it is. They're keeping them somewhere. All
the dissidents and sympathisers have been rounded up from the cities. Ow. So
... so what are you going to do? Fill their prisons until they're really fed
up?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: No, no. You see, the beauty of a dictatorship is that
everything is controlled directly from the top. And that means everything can
be accessed directly from below. Now we must be swift. Erm, Suneel? Suneel!  
(Door slides open.)  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: What?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I'm going to promote you to the rank of Captain.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Shut up.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: How would you like evidence that your Captain Carne is
a traitor?  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: You have no such evidence...  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: He will come in here shortly, then he will insist on
leaving with me, without explanation. All you have to do is follow us.  
SENATOR SALA: Are you sure you know what you're doing? How do you know he'll
do that?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Trust me. I've done this before.  
  
TRACK 5 - IN THE FOREST OF LUNE  
  
(Forest noises in the background.)  
ACE: How far is this place?  
CASMUS: A few days' walk. Across the Lune Forest we attend, around the inland
sea.  
ACE: I still don't know how you knew I'd be on that ship. I mean, if the
Doctor sent you, how did he know?  
CASMUS: He did not send me, and neither of us knew where you would be.  
ACE: So, what? You can see the future?  
CASMUS: No, the future cannot be seen. For only in the seeing does it become
real. No, we can only predict what is likely to happen next.  
ACE: But you can't be that specific.  
CASMUS: No? You perceive chaos because the order is too complex for you. But
an order there is. We are in the painting, so we cannot see the painter. But
there is a painting, and not just a random smudge of colours. The bear eats
the fish of the river, and the fish eat the minnows, and the minnows eat the
plants, and the plants eat the light itself, and all in proportion, and all in
the same system, all in dynamic balance. If there is a hot summer, the fish
will grow plentiful, but no so much that they eat all the minnows, because the
bears will grow in number to eat more of the fish. This is the painting. A
delicate, organised, intricate painting. Reason above all must be your guide.
See where trouble always flares. See where your help is likely to be needed.  
ACE: But what about ... How can you predict random stuff?  
CASMUS: Nothing is random, especially stuff.  
(ACE short laugh.)  
CASMUS: Always see the pattern. This is no accident, there is no chaos here.
This is not mere chance.  
  
TRACK 6 - THE MINISTER'S TREACHERY  
  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Suneel? Open the cell door, I haven't got all day.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Yes, Captain.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: And in the name of Glory, man, clean your fingernails.  
(Door slides open.)  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Senator, you'll be pleased to know that the Fleet Pilot himself
will be here in two days time to interrogate you.  
SENATOR SALA: I will tell you what you need to know.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Indeed?  
SENATOR SALA: Yes. It turns out you are the son of a thousand fathers, every
one of them a bastard like you!  
(Gun prepared for firing.)  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Captain, I have some somewhat less ornate information
to exchange for my miserable life.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: You are to be shot, you grubby, dirty little man. What makes
you think you have anything to say that would interest me?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Because knowing where the resistance is going to
strike will allow you to plan an ambush, and make the victory look like
brilliant foresight on your part.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: What do you take me for? I could get this information from the
woman.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: No, the Fleet Pilot will get that information when he
interrogates her, and he will get the credit for any advantage it brings.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Well? I don't have all day.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Er, I can trust you?  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Ye-yes of course.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Well, they plan to swell their numbers tenfold by
freeing the dissidents from the main prison camp at Luria.  
SENATOR SALA: Traitor! Don't tell him about Luria.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: What? Oh, oh, yes - yes, sorry.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Luria? How do you know about Luria?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Well, we didn't for sure but you just told us.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: What? Wait a minute.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: And you don't want the Fleet Pilot to know that you
can let secrets like that slip out in conversation, do you?  
CAPTAIN CARNE: He won't find out from you.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: No, he'll find out from her.  
SENATOR SALA: Luria. The camp is at Luria. Captain Carne told me.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: She remembers, you see?  
CAPTAIN CARNE: The informa... The information won't be any use to you. You
won't be able to tell anyone.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: She'll be able to tell the Fleet Pilot, which will be
enough to have you, what? Demoted? Shot? We're going to die anyway. We don't
care.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: But no...  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: But yes.  
SENATOR SALA: Luria. Now we know. Thank you, Captain Carne.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: But ... What do you want?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Take me to a computer terminal, and I can show you
every detail of the weaknesses they plan to attack. You can then get the glory
of foiling it, and I get to live.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: I'll squash the attack under Pilot's nose. But if this is a
trick...  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Oh, perish the thought, my dear Captain. You'd shoot
me. I know better than to take you for a fool.  
(Bleep. Door slides open.)  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Suneel? I'll take the prisoner from here. You wait here and
guard the woman.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: But - but sir, I'm under orders to do...  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Question my orders again and I'll have you executed for
insubordination.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Sir.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Now, don't try anything.  
  
TRACK 7 - HERE TO HELP  
  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Computer.  
COMPUTER: Canis rising, Captain.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Access maintenance schematic for Luria deep cover camp. Lower
security clearance. Show no detail, access only. Quickly.  
COMPUTER: Please wait. Here is the item you requested.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Captain, would you mind telling me what you're doing?  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Suneel, how dare you. I ordered you to stay where you were.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: So you could give a prisoner access to our computers?
You'll be shot for this.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: No. I am merely trying to determine whether or not the
guerrillas are going to attack Luria.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: You've just shown him the schematics. Now they know where to
attack.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: No, no, we'll just kill him. He can't get that information to
the resistance.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I'm afraid I can. Computer?  
COMPUTER: Canis rising.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I rather think not. (Command voice) "One zero, star
base cube eight."  
(The power fades down and COMPUTER becomes erratic.)  
COMPUTER: I think I need some attention.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Oh no! What has he done?  
(Alarm starts.)  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Computer! Lights! Lights!  
(Shots fired.)  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Where is he?  
COMPUTER: Alert.  
(Shots fired.)  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Stop shooting, you imbecile. Computer.  
COMPUTER: I'm sorry...  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Emergency lockdown.  
(Unintelligible babbles from COMPUTER.)  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Computer! Computer!  
COMPUTER: Thank you ... Yes ... I'm sorry ... Affirmative ... No ... Thank you
... No...  
(Door opened.)  
SENATOR SALA: Who is it? Who's there?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Me. Snake. How do you feel about a spot of escape?  
  
TRACK 8 - DISCOVERY  
  
(Military music playing.)  
COMPUTER: Bedtime is in two hours. Please make sure you are safely home in two
hours' time. Canis rising.  
(Tardis materialisation. Door opened. Walking.)  
THE DOCTOR: That's what we want. A wall computer.  
ANTIMONY: Why can't we just blow Tannis up?  
THE DOCTOR: That would make you as bad as him - and me, worse. That's a line
we drew for ourselves long ago. You learn early on that if you wipe out all
the bad ones, the good ones turn bad. We're going to give Tannis a rival, and
set the dogs fighting against themselves.  
ANTIMONY: Well, someone must be in charge while Tannis is off-planet.  
THE DOCTOR: Yes. I'm going to subtly find out who it is.  
ANTIMONY: (whispering) Leave it to me. (Loudly) Hoi! Who's in charge round
here?  
WOMAN: Premier Bedloe.  
ANTIMONY: Thanks. What? It worked.  
THE DOCTOR: All right. Now, we need to get to him. By my reckoning the leader
of Canis would have got a bit nervous about Tannis's over-mighty ways. Tannis
must have something Bedloe wants.  
ANTIMONY: Or someone.  
THE DOCTOR: Touch the screen.  
COMPUTER: Greetings, Citizens. Canis rising. Please state your enquiry.  
THE DOCTOR: Right, let's see. Does Premier Bedloe have a family?  
COMPUTER: Our beloved leader and the mother of our people have two children.
If you would like to send a gift to them, you may do so here. If you would
like to wish them well, please indicate here. If you have overheard
inappropriate or disrespectful comments about them, please indicate here. If
you wish to report a subversive or anti-social act, please indicate here.  
ANTIMONY: But why are we so interested in his family? I mean, his wife's
horrible. Well, she is - you saw the picture, she's got that thing on her
nose...  
THE DOCTOR: (quietly) Shh! We have to act like loyal citizens.  
ANTIMONY: Oh.  
THE DOCTOR: Computer, we kidnapped the beloved leader's children.  
ANTIMONY: What?  
COMPUTER: Please wait by this panel while you are arrested. Thank you for
reporting an anti-social act. If you would like to report another subversive
or anti-social act, please indicate here. If you would like to go back to a
previous query, please indicate here. For options, say "options."  
ANTIMONY: How do you make it shut up?  
COMPUTER: I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that...  
ANTIMONY: Computer, shut up.  
COMPUTER: If you would like to rephrase your request, please indicate here. If
you would like help, please indicate here.  
ANTIMONY: I don't want help, I want you to stop.  
(A vehicle has approached.)  
COMPUTER: If you would like help, please indicate here. For options, say
"options."  
ANTIMONY: Options.  
COMPUTER: Thank you. Just a moment.  
(Angry tapping.)  
COMPUTER: Options. To auto entry, say "one." To re-text, say "two."  
(The voice goes higher and higher as it continues giving a third option. Then
a smash.)  
THE DOCTOR: Temper.  
GUARD: Canis rising, Citizens. Please come with us.  
ANTIMONY: What? Hey, get off me.  
GUARD: Come with us, please.  
ANTIMONY: Get off!  
GUARD: Now.  
THE DOCTOR: (quietly) It's all right, it's all right. Let's hope Tannis has
done his bit.  
  
PILOT: He what?  
CAPTAIN CARNE: He s... he seemed to speak to the computer in a certain way,
sir.  
PILOT: A certain way? Really?  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Yes, Fleet Pilot, I ... I fought with him, but he overpowered
me. He had super-human strength, he ... he seemed to say several things at
once and ... then as soon as he did that the entire power system failed
catastrophically. During that time he escaped with Sala. There was nothing we
could do, Fleet Pilot, sir.  
PILOT: Indeed. And he didn't get any information from the computer?  
CAPTAIN CARNE: Certainly not, Fleet Pilot.  
PILOT: What I want to know is, how did he get to the computer terminal?  
CAPTAIN CARNE: I...  
PILOT: Oh, spare me the excuses. I have already spoken to Lieutenant Suneel,
who is now a Captain.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Hello, Carne.  
CAPTAIN CARNE: But I ... I ... Suneel? He's lying. Suneel, you traitor.  
(Shot. CAPTAIN CARNE gasps.)  
CAPTAIN CARNE: This floor is...  
(He chokes, and slumps.)  
PILOT: Get rid of that.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: Yes, Fleet Pilot.  
  
(Bleep of communicator.)  
PILOT: General, the escaped woman has been positively identified as Senator
Sala.  
GENERAL TANNIS: (communicator) Indeed? Does she have any military background?  
PILOT: No, General. She has a record in Government only of welfare reform.  
GENERAL TANNIS: (communicator) Can I take it that it wasn't this housewife who
collapsed a computer system planet-wide?  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: I believe it was her companion, a man calling himself ...
the Minister.  
GENERAL TANNIS: (communicator) The Minister. Indeed. Just the sort of
typically cretinous name I'm looking for.  
LIEUTENANT SUNEEL: He appears to have introduced a virus to the computer
verbally, sir. How he could do this or how it is possible remains unclear
unless he is some sort of android.  
GENERAL TANNIS: (communicator) Yes, of course. I'm en route to Santiny. I want
this Minister found, but not approached.  
PILOT: That will be difficult. Planetary communications are still down. We
only have ship-to-ship comms. Do you know this Minister, General?  
GENERAL TANNIS: No. But I think a lot of people have been looking for him for
a long time, and I think I just got there before them.  
  
GUARD: Do you have anything to confess?  
THE DOCTOR: Yes. I told you. We've kidnapped Premier Bedloe's children, and
we've come to deliver our ransom demand.  
ANTIMONY: And I bashed in a wall panel. It was annoying me.  
GUARD: The people's children are safe and well. Why would you confess such a
thing?  
THE DOCTOR: Why indeed, unless it's true. Check on their whereabouts. When you
find they've gone, you can inform your leader, and he'll be forever in your
debt.  
GUARD: We'll see.  
(Door slides closed.)  
  
TRACK 9 - THE DEAL  
  
PREMIER BEDLOE: I see. I'll be there directly.  
(Bleep.)  
PREMIER BEDLOE: Major Bander?  
MAJOR BANDER: Yes, beloved leader?  
PREMIER BEDLOE: I'm going for a short walk. I wish to be alone.  
MAJOR BANDER: I'm under strict instructions to protect your person at all
times, beloved leader.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: Ah - I am still your leader. I will go alone. Stay here.  
(Door slides open. Bleep.)  
MAJOR BANDER: This is Major Bander. Compressed super-luminal transmission.
Canis rising, General. General, the man you described has arrived as expected.
The Doctor is here.  
  
(Door slides open.)  
THE DOCTOR: Premier Bedloe, I presume.  
(Door slides closed.)  
PREMIER BEDLOE: Who are you and what do you want?  
THE DOCTOR: Tannis has your children. You want your children back, I want your
children back. You want Tannis brought down, I want Tannis brought down. I can
bring Tannis down with your help.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: You speak of treason against one of my greatest Generals? I
... I know nothing of such...  
THE DOCTOR: You know exactly what I'm talking about. Don't think Tannis will
baulk at killing. You can't trust your own people. No, let us try to help. I
want to know where Tannis is based.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: The defence ministry...  
THE DOCTOR: Is full of people. He wouldn't take them there. He would take them
to somewhere they wouldn't be seen. Somewhere full of his own people, and very
much out of sight. Where?  
PREMIER BEDLOE: He has a villa. there on the Turing coast. It's isolated. He
has his own bodyguard trained and housed there.  
THE DOCTOR: That's it. Now, have us released as a couple of harmless cranks,
and we will bring you your sons. If we do, then you are free to bring down
Tannis. Now, tell your guards to release us.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: But ... but who are you?  
THE DOCTOR: I'm just another alien.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: Alien? Alien to where?  
THE DOCTOR: Everywhere.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: Only one of my sons was taken. The other is safe.  
THE DOCTOR: Good. We'll bring him someone to play with.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: But, but ... this is preposterous. This is one of Tannis's
tortures. Why should I trust you?  
THE DOCTOR: You don't have to.  
(Bleep.)  
PREMIER BEDLOE: Release them.  
(Door slides open.)  
PREMIER BEDLOE: They said you were a doctor?  
THE DOCTOR: Of sorts, yes.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: Doctor, bring me my son, and I will bring you Tannis.  
  
TRACK 10 - ALONE TOGETHER  
  
(Outside now in a forest.)  
SENATOR SALA: How did you do that? How did you disable their computers?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I gave them a virus. But we must keep moving. The
Canisians will have them repaired before long. Come on.  
SENATOR SALA: Wait - wait, Snake ... Minister. Min... Why do you play with
those cubes so? Are they some sort of worry beads?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Perhaps. Numbers. The language of the abstract.  
SENATOR SALA: What about the not-abstract? Minister. What sort of idiotic name
is that, anyway? Don't you have another name?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Idiotic? If my mother had been born yet, she'd be
turning in her grave. I'm rather enjoying "Snake", actually.  
SENATOR SALA: Yes, it suits you. But really, what is your name?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Oh, I'm afraid I think you'd find it unpronounceable.  
SENATOR SALA: I would like to try.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Well, it's ... fnan ... anth...  
(SENATOR SALA laughs.)  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I told you it was unpronounceable.  
SENATOR SALA: No really, what is it?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Oh, we arrive by our names in the same way you do.
Your ancestors were named perhaps after what they did, and that nickname would
become their name. Erm, the giver, the taker, the meddler, the truth-seeker. I
was always concerned with ... probability. Sala. Now that must mean something
to do with ... sadness, eh?  
SENATOR SALA: Yes! It means sorrow.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Yes.  
SENATOR SALA: How did you know?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Well, there are common routes to most languages, one
learns along the road.  
SENATOR SALA: How many planets have you visited?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Is there something about this planet's atmosphere that
makes everyone an interrogator?  
SENATOR SALA: Must be a long, lonely road, I think.  
  
(Sounds as if a small fire to keep warm has been lit in the background.)  
ACE: Oh, I recognise that one. I'm surprised how similar the constellations
are here. Don't you think it's strange to think that that star might be dead
by now? The light's taken so long to get here.  
CASMUS: You're not looking across Space, but across Time. The fabric of the
heavens. Time is the canvas on which worlds are painted, and its ways are many
and mysterious.  
  
ANTIMONY: Excuse me, is this General Tannis's villa?  
(Shots.)  
ANTIMONY: You'll have to be quicker than that.  
GUARD: Freeze. Identify yourself.  
THE DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. Have you got a child hostage?  
GUARD: Don't move. Identify yours...  
(Thump.)  
THE DOCTOR: This way.  
  
ACE: I don't think I'll ever forget this view. This is something I'll tell my
grandchildren about.  
(CASMUS gives a gentle grunt to indicate no.)  
ACE: What?  
CASMUS: The responsibility we carry is great, as is the power we wield. But
the painters cannot be in the picture. You cannot become involved to that
extent.  
ACE: What do you mean?  
CASMUS: You will walk a tightrope. You will be like other humans, and yet not
like them. You will be the same as them, and yet more than them. But in some
ways, you must always remain aloof.  
  
THE DOCTOR: Right. Get their uniforms and masks.  
ANTIMONY: Okay.  
THE DOCTOR: Tie that one up. Now we start a riot. As soon as they realise
there's a fire, they'll run to where the child is. You watch through those
windows, see where they're running to.  
ANTIMONY: Okay.  
THE DOCTOR: As soon as you know, you signal to me. In the confusion, we run in
looking like the rest of them, get the child and run like the clappers to the
Tardis.  
ANTIMONY: Easy.  
  
ACE: What are you saying?  
CASMUS: (sigh.) You will have no grandchildren, nor children, nor a mate.
Bonds of affection between us and them are too great a risk, and the
consequences are too dreadful to contemplate.  
ACE: I see. I think I knew that already.  
CASMUS: Yes. You must walk lightly in the world now. Light as smoke.  
  
(Explosion.)  
ANTIMONY: Fire!  
MAN: What was that?  
(Confused shouts.)  
MAN: Where's the fire coming from?  
MAN 2: It's the child, where's the child?  
MAN: I've got him!  
ANTIMONY: I'll take him. Thank you.  
(Punch. Confused shouts.)  
  
ACE: Don't you get lonely?  
CASMUS: You learn to take pleasure in the things around you. There are many
flowers in the garden, each with a different scent. If you don't linger too
long by the lilies, you soon find comfort in the scent of roses, and then, of
simple grass.  
  
(Baby crying.)  
THE DOCTOR: This way. Nearly there. Make it stop crying.  
ANTIMONY: Erm, yeah. Shh. Excuse me, can you...? How?  
THE DOCTOR: I don't know, I've never been one.  
  
CASMUS: Sleep now. Tomorrow, we will reach the caverns, and that will be your
first test.  
ACE: (yawns.) Quite glad, to be honest. Time Lords must lead a pretty boring
life.  
  
GUARD: Sir, someone with a primitive incendiary device at the rear entrance of
the villa.  
MAJOR BANDER: Wait. Where's the child?  
GUARD: Someone had it.  
MAJOR BANDER: Who?  
(Tardis dematerialises.)  
  
TRACK 11 - A CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCE  
  
(Tardis materialises. Door opens. Child squeal.)  
THE DOCTOR: Premier Bedloe. We have something for you.  
(Baby crying.)  
PREMIER BEDLOE: Oh! My son, my son.  
THE DOCTOR: He's safe and well. Unlike Tannis's guards, I hope. Now, you have
your son, and I want something from you.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: I would give you anything if I could.  
THE DOCTOR: We want the same thing. I want to stop Tannis from taking over the
universe.  
PREMIER BEDLOE: Doctor, you brought me my child, for which I'm ever in your
debt. However, due to factors beyond my control, I'm afraid there's been a
change of circumstance.  
THE DOCTOR: What do you mean?  
(GENERAL TANNIS steps out of hiding.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: He means that our beloved leader and I have come to a little
understanding, haven't we, Bedloe?  
PREMIER BEDLOE: He found out. I don't know how.  
ANTIMONY: Who are you?  
GENERAL TANNIS: I'm a very, very bad man.

EPISODE FOUR: NO CHILD OF EARTH  
  
TRACK 12 - PRIMITIVE RELIGIONS  
  
ACE: Oh, this is lovely. You got anything slightly less like a spooky giant
pothole?  
CASMUS: We are not stopping to rest, not yet.  
ACE: But we've been going all day.  
CASMUS: And we must continue when we have finished here. This is the Cavern of
Infinite Death.  
ACE: Mm, nice.  
CASMUS: Now, he-here is your task. You must cross to the other side by
standing only on the stalagmites. You must not allow any part of your body to
touch the pool of saronite.  
ACE: Bog off, it's impossible!  
CASMUS: I will not bog off.  
ACE: You try it.  
CASMUS: I already have, and here I am. Are you afraid?  
ACE: Weren't you?  
CASMUS: Oh, yes. But that is neither here nor there. A coward and a hero both
feel fear. A coward is simply a man who obeys it.  
ACE: You know, all your proverbs are about men. Haven't you ever heard of
feminism?  
CASMUS: I am not familiar with your primitive religions. Now, concentrate. Be
bold in your strides, and purposeful.  
ACE: But you can't expect me to ... (Sigh.) Oh, all right, let's get it over
with.  
CASMUS: Go.  
(Jumping over from one piece of rock to another.)  
CASMUS: Good. Be careful. You must not touch the saronite. Should you fall,
the consequences would be unthinkable.  
  
(Rain, thunder.)  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Jump!  
SENATOR SALA: My leg is too weak.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I'll catch you. Trust me.  
SENATOR SALA: You say that too often for an honest man.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I don't remember claiming to be honest or a man. Now,
jump!  
  
(Jumping across more rocks.)  
CASMUS: Good. Try not to land with all your weight on one foot. And alike any
slippery.  
  
SENATOR SALA: We have to find another way round.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: There's no time. They'll repair the computer system
soon.  
  
CASMUS: Always move, never wait. There is no true stillness. In a flowing
stream, even to keep still you must swim forward.  
(ACE grunt of effort.)  
  
SENATOR SALA: If you drop me I will come back to haunt you. You'd better have
a strong...  
(Dislodging.)

TRACK 13 - BAD JOKES  
  
(ACE cries out, splashing about.)  
ACE: Aah! Ah, it's all over me! Oh, what do I do? Get it off! How do you get
it off?  
  
(SENATOR SALA gasps.)  
SENATOR SALA: I'm okay. I'm okay, thank you.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Yes, erm ... you can let go. I, erm, sometimes like to
circulate my blood.  
  
ACE: How do you get it off?  
CASMUS: There is something, but I forget its name. Oh yes. A towel.  
ACE: But what about the poison?  
CASMUS: Who said it was poisonous?  
ACE: But ... but ... you said it...  
CASMUS: I said you mustn't touch the saronite.  
ACE: Well, what is saronite?  
CASMUS: It is much like water, with one important exception.  
ACE: What exception? What is it!  
CASMUS: It is red.  
(Her splashing stops.)  
ACE: It's red?  
(CASMUS wheezes with amusement.)  
ACE: So - why couldn't I tou...? Oh no. Oh no!  
(CASMUS laughs.)  
ACE: I don't believe this. The Cave of Infinite Death? Oh, you made that up!  
(CASMUS laughs.)  
ACE: Oh, that's rubbish! I can't believe you did that.  
  
SENATOR SALA: You know, the more jokes you make, the more there is something
sad about you.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Nonsense. I'm as happy as a simile.  
SENATOR SALA: You seem somehow older than you look.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Very kind of you to say so. I like to think I cut a
dapper presence despite my alleged antiquity.  
SENATOR SALA: Always joking. You have the cold eyes of a dog beaten so often
that when he is hit he no longer barks.  
  
TRACK 14 - BREAK THE RULES, BREAK THE WORLD  
  
ACE: So the big lesson we've learned today children, is...  
CASMUS: It is this. In the world of this game, you must perform a series of
steps in order to complete the task I set. In order to reach the other side,
you must negotiate the stalagmites. However, now that you have knowledge of
the world _outside_ the game, you may cut out the difficult series of steps
and simply complete the task without effort. In the world of the game, that
means walking to the other side. The question is, do you follow the path of
greatest comfort, or do you obey the rules, even though the task be harder?  
ACE: Guess. Well, I'm sorry, but why not?  
CASMUS: Because your understanding of the world as it really is puts you above
your fellow man. It gives you a terrible power. And if you exercise that power
for good or evil, you cannot live amongst the others as an equal.  
  
SENATOR SALA: You do this often, don't you? Arrive in a place, then run on to
your next brush with humanity.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: If you can manage to speak a little louder, I'm sure
that a nice Canisian patrol will be able to detect us.  
  
ACE: We're not talking about a game now, are we?  
CASMUS: We are not.  
  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Come on, give me your arm.  
SENATOR SALA: I can manage on my own now, thank you.  
  
CASMUS: You will have the ability to break the rules, but the rules are all
that make the world. If you break the rules, you'll break the world.  
ACE: Are you saying the world is a game?  
CASMUS: No. I am saying that there is a greater world outside it. Not left,
not right, not up, not down, not through ... out.  
  
TRACK 15 - JUMPING STALAGMITES  
  
SENATOR SALA: Snake, wait, I...  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Oh, now here. Get - get up on my back. Come on. I'll
do the walking, if you can stay awake to navigate. Hup! Sala? Sala?  
SENATOR SALA: Keep the noise down, Snake, I'm trying to sleep.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: (sigh) How can someone with so elegant a figure weigh
so much? Did you fall in love with gravity?  
SENATOR SALA: You're not so thin yourself, for a snake. Why don't you use your
power to help us?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Mm?  
SENATOR SALA: I haven't forgotten. I know you're something special. Maybe sent
to help us. Maybe it's fate. Tell me what I must do. I want to save my people.
What can I do?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Well, I'm relying on you to navigate. I don't know
this planet. Please, keep your mind on the path, mm?  
  
(Bubbling n the background.)  
ACE: So the world outside this one has a mind.  
CASMUS: The world outside this _is_ the mind. It is memory, consciousness,
intent, thought itself. And its manipulation is the greatest of our powers.  
ACE: Powers? Show me, then.  
CASMUS: Don't be so eager. This is the most powerful, the most real of things,
and the most terrible and dangerous, and its misuse is to court destruction.
Should any one of us begin to walk that path, well...  
  
SENATOR SALA: Snake, stop. Put me down. I'm too weak to go on. Listen to me.
You must leave me here.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Oh, I can manage. You're not that heavy.  
SENATOR SALA: You know you can't. I can't walk. I have lost too much blood. I
didn't show you the injuries on my back.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: What? Why not? No, I can carry you. Here.  
(Lifting.)  
SENATOR SALA: Snake, if we free those prisoners from Luria, we will have an
army, and a fighting chance. This is more important than my life. It is all I
want. Go.  
  
ACE: Oh, I wouldn't misuse it.  
CASMUS: No, of course not. None of you ever would. So sure, so confident, so
flippant. Would you ever kill a man?  
ACE: No.  
CASMUS: Would you kill a man if he were about to kill a friend?  
ACE: Well, maybe.  
CASMUS: Or would you have the strength to stand and watch him die? To watch a
thousand die?  
  
SENATOR SALA: Go on, tell them.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I ... I ... I can't heal you again.  
  
CASMUS: We guard Time, the substance of the universe. It is ours to manipulate
with a thought.  
  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Show me your back.  
(Humming. SENATOR SALA gasps.)  
  
ACE: Why is it so dangerous? I don't get it.  
CASMUS: Because it is the power of Creation, and it is not your place to make
the world one way, or another. If you banish darkness, then light will not
exist.  
  
SENATOR HAWK: Sala.  
SENATOR SALA: Hawk. It's Luria. We must attack Luria now.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: The Canisian computer system is down, but it won't
take them long to put it right. You must attack now.  
SENATOR SALA: It's true. They have a camp full of resistance sympathisers
hidden at Luria.  
SENATOR HAWK: Everyone, to your units, quickly. Prepare to march for Luria.
Sala, you're injured. You let them torture her!  
SENATOR SALA: No, he saved me, Hawk. Go. Go to your unit...  
  
CASMUS: Evil too has its place, and death, and pain, and sorrow. It is your
place only to fight them, not to end them with a stroke.  
  
SENATOR HAWK: Move out.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I'm sorry you had to go through that. I fear I was so
intent on the job in hand that I failed to take sufficient account of your
well-being.  
SENATOR SALA: Don't go soft on me now, Snake. We did it, we made it.  
  
ACE: Jumping stalagmites?  
CASMUS: Yes, jump, always. Even though you may fall.  
  
SENATOR SALA: Come. We must rejoin my unit. Take my hand. Thanks to you,
General Tannis won't know what hit him.  
  
TRACK 16 - DEATH METAL  
  
THE DOCTOR: Tannis?  
ANTIMONY: Tannis, I thought you were on Santiny.  
(Gun prepared to fire.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: Don't, boy. If you move I'll shoot the Doctor. Oh, and if you
move, Doctor, I'll shoot the boy. It's a little family game of my own
creation. Fast, isn't he? Congratulations, Doctor. Don't look so surprised, of
course I know who you are. You're quite a legend in our circles. You just
don't know what I am. The universe moves in patterns, Doctor, doesn't it,
everything moves in patterns. Political systems, planets, everything.
Everything can be predicted and manipulated, can't it, Doctor? And that's what
you do. You waltz around, manipulating things because they're so predictable.
But do you know what else is predictable? Oh, you don't? How ironic. It's Time
Lords. Swaggering around in an undisguised time capsule. The arrogance.  
THE DOCTOR: Antimony, I want you to go, now.  
ANTIMONY: I can't. He'll shoot you.  
THE DOCTOR: He'll shoot me anyway. Now, go!  
GENERAL TANNIS: He's not moving, Doctor. Ask him again.  
THE DOCTOR: Antimony, get out now, go!  
ANTIMONY: No! I'm not leaving you.  
GENERAL TANNIS: The boy who moves faster than the eye, they say. Well, try it,
boy. You might even get to me before I shoot him.  
ANTIMONY: I'll get to you all right.  
THE DOCTOR: What do you want?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh, it's so unimaginative I'm almost embarrassed to say. To
run the universe. And I want all of you out of the way. Oh, we don't all make
grand entrances in flashy Tardises and ridiculous clothes. Just because you're
a Time Lord doesn't mean you can't behave like a petty dictator.  
THE DOCTOR: You're a Time Lord? My boy, he's going to shoot me anyway. Now,
go!  
ANTIMONY: No! I won't let him shoot you, Doctor. I don't want _anyone_ to die.  
THE DOCTOR: Ant, go, please, trust me, just go!  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh, he won't leave his father. What? You mean he doesn't know?  
ANTIMONY: What's he talking about, Doctor?  
GENERAL TANNIS: (laugh) Oh, you must be very fond of him. Antimony, like the
metal. He can dodge bullets, they say.  
THE DOCTOR: Ant, please...  
ANTIMONY: No! You put that gun down, Tannis. I'm warning you.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Now, here's a thing. You can dodge bullets, but have you ever
been shot? Well, let's experiment. Let's try a leg.  
(Shot. ANTIMONY cry.)  
THE DOCTOR: Stop, Tannis!  
GENERAL TANNIS: I said don't move.  
ANTIMONY: Doctor, why is it...? It's circuits.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Look at that. A metal leg. Let's try an arm.  
(Shot.)  
THE DOCTOR: Stop!  
GENERAL TANNIS: Quite a dilemma, isn't it, Doctor? You move, I kill you, no-
one left to stop me. You don't, I kill him. You kill me - well, we know you
won't do that.  
(ANTIMONY groans.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: You know, I heard all about you, and I thought to myself, what
species can move that fast? And then I saw the footage from the villa, and
something struck me as a little too precise. You don't fumble like a human,
you don't sway or stumble.  
ANTIMONY: Doctor...  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh, he doesn't get it.  
ANTIMONY: What ... what am I?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Let me summarise your predicament, Doctor. Loneliness,
isolation, centuries of solitude, all your acquaintances age and die before
your eyes, they fall in love and they leave you. Why not build one that will
last forever? Look, boy. Wires in your leg.  
(Shot.)  
ANTIMONY: Why?  
GENERAL TANNIS: And you know what? The Doctor could save you. He could tell me
to die - oh, and I would. He could tell a ship to explode - oh, and it would,
but he won't. Will you, Doctor? Look. Wires in your head.  
(Shot fired.)  
THE DOCTOR: No!  
ANTIMONY: (weakly) Doctor? Doctor.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Goodbye, Doctor. That's the thing about Time Lords. You never
know who is one.  
(Door closed. Tardis dematerialisation.)  
THE DOCTOR: Antimony.  
  
TRACK 17 - CONSIDER THE LILIES  
  
(It is raining.)  
SENATOR SALA: Come on, Snake. Now you're the slow one. Wait! We'll rest for
five minutes.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: What's that sound?  
SENATOR SALA: That is the lilies on the lake. Their leaves collect water and
the rain, and ... when the weight of it becomes too heavy they wilt, and the
water splashes into the lake, and they spring upright again. They develop a
shiny wax on the surface to stop the water penetrating, but it just collects
on the outside and when there is too much, it gives way.  
(Sniffing.)  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Oh. It's overwhelming. The scent of the ferns. The air
is ... is delicious. This is a place ... a place where one could ... live.  
SENATOR SALA: If I had your power, that thing you did - I would use it to help
my people.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: We - we have a sort of code.  
SENATOR SALA: Yes, I know. But no code would keep me from healing all the hurt
here and driving the Canisians out.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I think you might find it difficult to understand.  
SENATOR SALA: I understand this. Without other grains, sand is not sand. All
men are the same, I think, wherever you are.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: You don't understand. I'm not a man.  
SENATOR SALA: I know. You are more than a man, better.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: No, no.  
SENATOR SALA: Yes, to me, yes. All people feel the same things. Some try not
to love for fear of the sorrow, but sooner or later, the feelings must be
faced, or they will face you.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Perhaps for some, it is not they that would be hurt by
... involvement. Sometimes it's for the good of all that a few must remain
isolated.  
  
TRACK 18 - MOUNT PLUTARCH  
  
ACE: When, though? Why have the power if you can't use it? I mean, if you're
almost never to use your power, why _almost_ never? Why sometimes and not
others? When can you use it?  
CASMUS: Teatime.  
ACE: And the punch-line is...?  
CASMUS: This is not a world of absolutes. It is a world of approximation.
Everything changes constantly. It is a moving stream. You must swim, merely to
keep still. Nothing here is truly itself. There is the crux. There is no
certain answer to your question. You must judge each time. This is the subtle
line we walk.  
ACE: Talking off walking, is it much further? This mountain goes on forever.  
CASMUS: Yes indeed, but we do not. We have arrived.  
ACE: Where is he, then?  
CASMUS: Where is who?  
ACE: The Kingmaker.  
CASMUS: Ah. Sweet irony. He is in there. You must enter alone.  
ACE: I think you've got a thing about caves. Are you going to be here when I
get out?  
CASMUS: I shall be here.  
ACE: Only, you're so old I thought you might croak if I take too long.  
CASMUS: This is no time for levity. Go.  
ACE: All right, all right.  
  
TRACK 19 - THE HERO RETURNS  
  
COMPUTER: Docking complete. Canis rising.  
(Door slides open.)  
PILOT: Canis rising. General, welcome back to Santiny.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Have you found him?  
PILOT: No General, we don't have planetary communications yet.  
GENERAL TANNIS: We are dealing with a super-intelligent strategist. He
sabotaged the computers for a purpose. Any resistance attacks?  
PILOT: None, General. The slave mines have experienced a couple of uprisings
but nothing from resistance as yet. They don't have super-atmospheric craft,
sir. Our main weaponry is safe. Do you think he'll attack power stations?  
GENERAL TANNIS: No. He'll play to his strengths, which are ... small-scale
guerrilla warfare from the jungle. He'll want more personnel. Pilot, where is
the main detention camp?  
PILOT: The plain of Luria, General.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Take me there. Now.  
  
TRACK 20 - THE KINGMAKER, HE  
  
(Walking in a cave.)  
ACE: Hello? Hello? Hello!  
(ACE gasps. THE KINGMAKER has the voice of an old woman.)  
THE KINGMAKER: Do not miss the sparrow at your feet as you stare at the
distant mountain. Neither miss the mountain as you meet the sparrow's eye. You
must see all. The Time Lords guard Time and I guard the Time Lords. Should you
violate Time and use it to your own ends, good or ill, you will be hunted down
and destroyed without pity. Speak!  
ACE: Well...  
THE KINGMAKER: Speak!  
ACE: I don't feel ready to take that responsibility.  
THE KINGMAKER: Good. Then it is yours.  
ACE: What?  
THE KINGMAKER: The path you choose is a lonely one. You will age and you will
not die. Yet you will never be young again. You will wander abroad, and will
not form attachments as others of your race do. You will be alone and live for
the many, and the One. You will possess great power, and great responsibility.
Speak.  
ACE: Do I have a choice?  
THE KINGMAKER: Pleasantries! You have already chosen. However, before I allow
you to become what you may, you must pass a test. You will go to Anima Persis.  
ACE: But - can't I think about it? I mean, it's a bit sudden.  
THE KINGMAKER: You will go now. Anima Persis is a geo-psychic world. Strange
figures leer from the storm-clouds. There are auras over the deserts in times
of great heat, and the cacti hiss foul words as strangers pass. The weapons
that wiped out its population were products of the planet. When the chemicals
came they killed the plants and the land. But when the bombs came, they blew
the souls from their victims' bodies. And now, all that is left of its people
are vengeful ghosts.  
ACE: So what do I do when I get there?  
THE KINGMAKER: You will take light, but no weapons. And you will defeat the
spirits of the tortured dead and restore the planet to its inhabitants.  
ACE: Defeat them? What with?  
THE KINGMAKER: We grant you Tardis!  
(Explosion sound made at start of Tardis dematerialisation.)  
THE KINGMAKER: What you do with it determines whether or not we shall meet
again. And mark me well - should you corrupt your power, should you wield it
irresponsibly in feckless impulse or mad passion ... Now, go.  
  
TRACK 21 - THE MINISTER'S DESTRUCTION  
  
SENATOR SALA: Hawk, where are you?  
SENATOR HAWK: (communicator) We've set the cannon on the edge of the jungle
about quarter of a mile from the main gate. Are their communications still
down?  
SENATOR SALA: Affirmative. We have no com traffic detectable to or from this
base. Prepare to blow the main gate. The Minister and I will direct the
prisoners when they come out.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Quickly. This silence is too deep. Too deep.  
SENATOR SALA: Relax. Their communications are still down.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I know, I ... feel something.  
  
PILOT: General, we are beginning to regain communications. We have just
received a satellite image of Luria camp, sir.  
GENERAL TANNIS: On screen.  
(Sound of this.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: Scan the forest edge.  
(Whining of scanner.)  
PILOT: That's them. The Minister and Sala.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Enlarge. Hah. No. Can it be that easy? Excellent. (Laughs.)
Excellent. (Laughs.)  
PILOT: Sir?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Look how they're standing, Pilot.  
PILOT: I don't follow, General.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh, let me explain. What's our ETA to Luria?  
PILOT: Three minutes, General.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Come here. Stand there, as she is standing. Closer. That's it.
Now reply candidly - how do you feel? Well? You feel uncomfortable, don't you?  
PILOT: Yes, General.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Unlike these two. He probably doesn't even realise, they are
too close for comfort, Pilot, which makes them very easy to hurt.  
PILOT: General, if I may ask, why are we so interested in this Minister?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Do you know why I signed the treaty of Carselai, Pilot? Do you
know why I signed away the right to all those planets?  
PILOT: It's not my place to question you, General, but I assumed there was a
strategic advantage in placating the UP.  
GENERAL TANNIS: That's what I wanted them to think. No. It's because on a
small, obstinate plant-infested world in Alnilam, we dropped a plague. No-one
noticed, not even the UP. The population was only a couple of hundred million,
light years from anywhere. But they resisted our attempts to mine the planet
core, so we dropped a plague on them.  
  
SENATOR HAWK: Return fire.  
(Shots.)  
MALE: (communicator) That's the last of the gun turrets destroyed, Senator.  
  
GENERAL TANNIS: On the first day, they became sick. The second, the symptoms
became acute. What do you think happened to the population on the third day,
Pilot?  
PILOT: I assume they perished, General.  
  
SENATOR HAWK: (amplified) Prisoners of the Canisians, this is Senator Hawk of
the Santine Republic. We are here to free you. Say goodbye to Luria.  
(Cheering.)  
SENATOR HAWK: (amplified) Stand as far from the gate as you can.  
MAN: Open fire.  
(Shots.)  
  
GENERAL TANNIS: You would assume that, wouldn't you? Except that on the third
day, no-one died. In fact, on the third day, the plague was gone. The
inhabitants awoke to find themselves in perfect health. Not a trace of it. Two
hundred million people.  
PILOT: That's certainly unusual, General.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Isn't it just.  
  
SENATOR SALA: We were right. Good work. Pull back, Hawk.  
MALE: Fire!  
(Explosions. Cheering.)  
  
GENERAL TANNIS: And do you know what else is unusual, Pilot? No-one could find
any explanation. No medical anomalies, no genetic resistance, nothing. Well, I
was so intrigued, I went there myself, and I could find nothing unusual
either. Then by pure chance, I discovered a small cult on the outskirts of the
capital city. They claimed that the blessed god of the trees or some such had
descended amongst them for a time.  
PILOT: Yes, General?  
  
SENATOR SALA: Look at them. Over here. This is wonderful. You did this. Now we
have an army. This is the greatest...  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Oh nonsense, I only ... Shh, shh, shh. What's that?  
(Soaring overhead.)  
  
GENERAL TANNIS: His arrival on the planet coincided roughly with when our
interest in the planet began. He was never seen again after the day of the
miraculous cure. They couldn't tell me where he came from, or why. They could
only tell me the name of their god. Manaster.  
  
SENATOR SALA: Canisians. How did they know?  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I don't know. Get them out of the open ground.  
SENATOR SALA: Here. Over here. Take cover.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Sala, go back! I'll do it! Into the forest, quickly.
Stay down!  
(Explosion.)  
  
PILOT: I'm not sure I follow, General.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Hmm. Of course. Why would you? Gunner? Open fire on the
prisoners. Scan for the Minister.  
PILOT: Got him, General.  
  
SENATOR SALA: No! No, they're massacring them...  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Sala, come back! Stop!  
SENATOR SALA: Make it stop! Stop them, use your power!  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I can't. Come under cover!  
SENATOR SALA: No, please. I'm begging you. Forget your code, save them.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I ... I can't. Stay down. Come back!  
SENATOR SALA: Please Minister, please, do it for me. Save us.  
  
(Bleeps.)  
MALE: (communicator) Target acquired, General.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Excellent. Fire.  
  
SENATOR SALA: What difference does a code make here? This is...  
(She is hit. She falls with a gasp.)  
SENATOR HAWK: Sala. Sala. No. Minister.  
  
GENERAL TANNIS: Good shooting. Pull up, maximum speed. Take me to my ship.
Withdraw.  
PILOT: Sir?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Do it. Now.  
  
SENATOR HAWK: Minister. Minister.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Leave. (Command voice) "Now!"  
(Explosions.)  
  
TRACK 22 - GOODBYE TO CASMUS  
  
CASMUS: Well, was he nice to you?  
ACE: Funny. She's a right laugh.  
CASMUS: (laugh.) Now, I have something for you.  
(Tardis materialisation.)  
CASMUS: This is my Tardis. It is a licence to move. The essence of transport
born of the fiery thoughts of travel and movement.  
(Doors opened.)  
ACE: I know what a Tardis is.  
  
(Tardis control room.)  
CASMUS: As always, you're not only wrong, but proud of it. The Tardis is not
simply a vehicle. It contains complex instrumentation. It receives signals of
any form of communication, and decodes, and combines them to the displays.  
ACE: What about you? Don't you need your Tardis?  
CASMUS: I ... Attend to the task in hand. This is the great test.  
ACE: No. What do you mean?  
CASMUS: For once, please, listen to me. You must go now. Time is against us.  
ACE: But ... I'm supposed to fight ghosts. I don't know why or what to do, how
- how will I know what to do?  
CASMUS: You will not need instructions. A Time Lord sees things that linear
beings do not. To them, the universe moves in beats, small events that change
small things. But great change takes time, and so a Time Lord sees the real
movement of things.  
ACE: But I'm not a Time Lord.  
CASMUS: Do well, as I know you will. Now, there is one last thing I have to
give you. This is your wand. With it, you will have the power to manipulate
Time, the most terrible and dangerous of our abilities. It is yours to guard,
but you must resist its use, and mark me well - you must not use it on Anima
Persis. The consequences would be unthinkable.  
ACE: I won't. You will be here when I get back, won't you?  
CASMUS: I shall be here.  
ACE: Promise?  
CASMUS: You're not frightened?  
ACE: Oh no you don't.  
CASMUS: In winter, when old wounds ache, remember - you are part of a greater
whole. Even though you walk in the desert, you are not alone, for the sky
itself cloaks you. You are a part of a great unity based on logic, and in a
logical universe, in the end, reason prevails.  
(Door closes. Tardis dematerialisation.)  
  
TRACK 23 - TWO IRONS IN THE FIRE  
  
PILOT: Sir, we've re-established full communication with the fleet.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Good. Gunship? This is General Tannis. Target the planet
surface at random, avoiding the area of Luria. Fire at will.  
PILOT: Sir?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Covering fire. I don't want him dead yet, Pilot. Someone else
will do that for me. Meanwhile I'm just ... twisting the knife.  
MALE VOICE: Sir, this is gunship Three. We are unable to fire. We're under
attack from an unknown weapon.  
(Cry, dies away.)  
MALE VOICE 2: General sir, I regret to inform that the gunship has exploded.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Hmm. He's more powerful than I thought. Pull out. All
remaining craft, pull out.  
PILOT: Sir, our ground forces report they are also under heavy attack from an
unknown weapon.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Leave them. Their sacrifice will be noted. Sever all
communications with the planet. Withdraw the fleet from orbit now. Now!  
PILOT: Ye... Er, General ... Sir, do I take it we're abandoning Santiny
altogether, sir?  
GENERAL TANNIS: You do.  
PILOT: But General, may I ask, what heading for the fleet?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh yes. You know, one should always have two irons in the
fire, Pilot. Always.

(After the announcer)  
THE KINGMAKER: Time is against you, Castellan.  
CASMUS: It is. This is no longer our age. Twilight falls, and the strange
dream ends.  
  
EPISODE FIVE: DEATH COMES TO TIME  
  
TRACK 1 - ANIMA PERSIS  
(Tardis console room. Door opened to howling wind.)  
ACE: Hello?  
(Howling wind continues.)  
ACE: Is someone there?  
(Howling wind continues, for about 17 seconds. Considerably longer than the
online version.)  
ACE: Hello?  
(Howling wind continues, for about 10 seconds.)  
ACE: Anyone there? Hello?  
(Faint voice. ACE gasps as though in pain. Screech of passing bird. ACE gasps.
Door opened. Screams from many people.)  
  
(Opening Doctor Who theme music, arranged by Nick Romero.)  
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Doctor Who. Death Comes To Time, by Colin Meek. Episode Five
- Death Comes To Time. Starring Sylvester McCoy as The Doctor.  
  
(Door opened. Screams from many people.)  
MAN: Come back, Megan!  
(Yes, he calls her Megan but in the cast list of the CD booklet she is Magan,
and the announcer at the end distinctly calls her Magan. So in this version
she is Magan.)  
MAGAN: Wait, Father, she's not one of them.  
MAN: Come back child, it's a trick!  
MAGAN: No, she's not one of them.  
ACE: Not one of who? What are you frightened of? I'm not here to hurt you.  
(Terrified whimpering from the group.)  
MAGAN: You're not from this planet. What are you?  
ACE: I'm a ... I'm a Time Lord.  
MAGAN: Have you come to help us?  
ACE: Yes. I think so. I thought there was no-one left alive on this planet.  
MAGAN: None of us has a life. We're the survivors of the wars.  
ACE: What are you so afraid of? Who did you think I was?  
MAGAN: Look. On stormy nights the spirits of the dead flow from that crater
and come here and penetrate our minds. They drive us mad with fear and there's
no escape from them.  
MAN: They feed off fear. They terrorise their victim to death. We're all
that's left.  
ACE: Well, I'm here to defeat them. We're going to take back your planet. Has
anyone ever been into the volcano?  
MAN: That would mean certain death.  
ACE: Who died and told you?  
MAGAN: There is a path, but I've never been up it all the way and, only in
daylight.  
ACE: Right. I'm going up the volcano. Anyone want to come with me?  
(Chorus of "No!" from the others. MAN's voice barely audible over the cries)  
MAN: You'll go mad. They'll drive you insane.  
ACE: Any other suggestions? It's either that or play board games.  
MAN: You'll go mad.  
ACE: Yeah, that won't take long if I sit in a bare hut in the dark with a load
of screaming people.  
MAGAN: I will go. I'd rather go with you than live another night like this.  
MAN: No! They will exact terrible revenge for this. We'd be better off
waiting. Maybe they won't come tonight.  
MAGAN: They'll come. They always come. I'm going.  
MAN: No! Please don't! Please, don't take my daughter!  
ACE: That's up to her. I won't let anything happen to her. I just need a
guide. And you lot - if they feed on fear, you might want to try to stop
whimpering.  
(Door opened into cold wind outside, door closed. The whimpering of the group
continues.)  
  
TRACK 2 - POOR TANNIS  
  
(Cat mewing.)  
CASMUS: What is it, Midas?  
(Cat mews.)  
CASMUS: Ah.  
(Gun prepared for firing.)  
CASMUS: Oh, you won't need that.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh, don't blame yourself, Casmus. It was inevitable. How do
they put it - society's to blame. With so much good in the universe, there had
to be a lot of bad in it somewhere - balance and all that. It was my fate, so
on and so forth.  
CASMUS: Fate must be shaped by the world. I'm sorry, but in such a coherent
universe, you fit so badly.  
GENERAL TANNIS: The universe will fit around me. I've disposed of the Time
Lords of the Fraction, the Saints are squashed, the Doctor and the Minister
will finish each other off. You are the last, Casmus. Where is the girl you
took from my ship?  
CASMUS: You're a little late for that.  
GENERAL TANNIS: I had more pressing matters to attend to. Where is she,
Casmus?  
CASMUS: I sent her to Anima Persis.  
GENERAL TANNIS: (snigger) The famous Casmus sense of humour. Don't toy with
me, I don't have time.  
CASMUS: And you never will. But you are the one beating about the bush. What
you really mean is, what is she?  
GENERAL TANNIS: I know she means something to you and the Doctor, which is
reason enough to kill her.  
CASMUS: Ah, you see, the best jokes are the ones whose conclusion you cannot
foresee, and this joke has not yet been told. She is the future. In time, she
will be like you and I.  
(GENERAL TANNIS laughs, and sighs.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: You're not serious. You can't make a Time Lord.  
CASMUS: Really? Do you think anatomy or appearance or possession define what
we are? We are what we do, slow agent. Ha-ha. You have come here seeking my
approval, and I regret I can give only my pity.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Save your pity for yourself. You're the one who's going to
die.  
CASMUS: I was always going to die. I'm so old, I try to mention my age all the
time, and I can't remember it. (Laughs.) My time has come, but so has yours.
Don't you see? You're the antique. The age of extremes is at an end. We're
relics of a chaotic time, when the skies were unexplored, and monsters roamed.
Now you look to the sky, and every star has a name. The great discoveries of
this plane have been made. The great swings of good and evil are over. The new
age will be one of balance. You can't see it, poor Tannis. For a Time Lord
you're so limited.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Limited? I rather think the universe is my oyster.  
CASMUS: Hardly. We're Time Lords. The many sparkling universes, the myriad
dimensions you could explore. But your ambitions are limited to the physical.
You are the smallest and most miserable of our kind, and she, she will be the
greatest of hers.  
  
TRACK 3 - THE WELL OF SOULS  
  
(Howling wind background.)  
MAGAN: We're approaching the northern lip of the crater. The demons are
within. Why are you not afraid?  
ACE: I _am_ afraid. I've just been trained to put fear to one side, and act
rationally. Either - they're just trying to scare you, in which case, not
acting scared is the solution, or - they're trying to scare you away from
here, in which case, coming here is the solution. Get it?  
MAGAN: I envy your confidence. You fill me with courage. I will go with you
into the crater.  
(Rumbling. Their voices echo.)  
MAGAN: I can't hear anything. Can you hear anything?  
ACE: (whispering.) I don't know, it's okay.  
(MAGAN gasps.)  
ACE: It's fine.  
MAGAN: How can you say that?  
ACE: It's nothing.  
MAGAN: What was that?  
ACE: Nothing, it's okay.  
  
(Their voices echo.)  
ACE: Shh!  
MAGAN: What?  
ACE: Hold your nerve.  
MAGAN: I ... I can't see anything beyond.  
ACE: Concentrate. Breathe deeply and slowly. Try not to act scared. I won't
let anything happen to you.  
  
TRACK 4 - MEET THE DEAD  
  
MAGAN: What happened?  
ACE: We're at the bottom.  
MAGAN: Where are they? There's nothing here.  
ACE: I don't know. Have a look round.  
WHISPERING: Stupid girl. I let her in here. So stupid, I won't let her die.
Try to encourage her, protect the child. Stupid girl. I let her in here. So
stupid...  
MAGAN: What's wrong, what's that sound?  
ACE: It's my thoughts.  
WHISPERING: Try to encourage her...  
ACE: I think they've turned into me.  
WHISPERING: Stupid girl. I let her in here. So stupid, I won't let her die...  
MAGAN: I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared!  
ACE: It's all right! It's all right!  
MAGAN: I can hear what you're thinking!  
WHISPERING: Try to encourage her.  
MALE VOICE: We can, we can, stupid girl, you can't fight us, we're in your
mind. Stupid girl, you failed, we see your thoughts, we take your mind, strong
mind, powerful mind, great power, powerful mind, great power here, great
power, you have, now we have, we have your mind, your mind is, your mind is
powerful, more powerful than us, what is the one...  
WHISPERING: Take the chance...  
MALE VOICE: What is the one, the one is the power, she could stop us.  
WHISPERING: I can't do that, I can't do that, the easy way, not the right way,
I won't do it, concentrate...  
ACE: Please! Please! Let the girl go! Please!  
MALE VOICE: Yes, we'll take your mind.  
MAGAN: Yes. Take me!  
ACE: Let her go!  
MALE VOICE: Yes, take your mind, your mind and your power then we have the
power, yes, then we kill the girl then we fly free and kill them all.  
WHISPERING: I can take the Tardis, yes I can take the Tardis...  
MALE VOICE: Yes, the Tardis, the Tardis, we can go anywhere, we can go
anywhere...  
WHISPERING: I can't do it, I can't let them, they could go anywhere, go
anywhere in the Tardis...  
MALE VOICE: Tardis everywhere then give us the girl and we let you go, give us
the girl and we let you go.  
MAGAN: No!  
MALE VOICE: Give us the girl.  
MAGAN: You said you wouldn't let them hurt me!  
WHISPERING: I can't, I can't. I have to. I can't, she was so brave, how can I?
I have to let her die, I can't, it's not human, it's impossible...  
MALE VOICE: Kill the child, kill the child and the rest, you can go. Kill the
child and then the rest and you can go.  
WHISPERING: I have to let her die, I can't, it's not human, it's impossible
choice.  
MAGAN: Please don't leave me! Please don't leave me, Ace! Mummy, please,
please...  
WHISPERING: All going to die, I have to, just once, it can't be too bad, just
once. Casmus, Casmus.  
(Reversing voices.)  
ACE: (echoing yell) Stop...!  
  
TRACK 5 - ACE IS REUNITED WITH THE DOCTOR  
  
(Humming of Tardis control room.)  
ACE: Where am I? Wait a minute, aren't you my jailer?  
GOLCRUM: Me? No, no, no, I used to be your jailer, sorry to say, but you got
rescued by an old man and I got sent here as punishment by General Tannis -
that and one or two lesions to the face and arms.  
(And this is the doctor she is reunited with - Golcrum from Episode 1 whom
Casmus commanded to devote his life to medicine.)  
ACE: Here? Where am I?  
GOLCRUM: We're on Anima Persis. We're on your ship ... if that's what you call
it. I found you collapsed outside. I was quite relieved, I can tell you. I
thought I'd never see another living soul. You opened the door, which was
another shock, but I was relieved by a small glass of water.  
(ACE groans.)  
GOLCRUM: Wait - wait, wait. Lie still. You've had some sort of trauma. Though
I'd say more psychological rather than physical.  
ACE: I ... Oh no. What about the others? What about the girl?  
GOLCRUM: Others? No, there's nothing else out there. Some ruins and a village.  
ACE: But no-one left alive?  
GOLCRUM: No-one I could see. Not even any bodies.  
ACE: I destroyed them all.  
GOLCRUM: No-one there like I said. That's why they sent me here, I suppose.
Shall we get off this planet, then?  
ACE: I failed them all. I couldn't let her die, and I couldn't let them have
my mind and I killed them all. I did exactly what I wasn't supposed to.  
  
TRACK 6 - WHO WALKS LIKE A CROW?  
  
(Slow sad walking, shuffling.)  
THE KINGMAKER: Who comes to Mount Plutarch in a cloud of sorrow? Who walks
like a crow plucked from a torrent?  
THE DOCTOR: It's me.  
THE KINGMAKER: Little truth-seeker. I have summoned you before and you did not
come.  
THE DOCTOR: I know. This is different.  
THE KINGMAKER: Yes, different. What would you have me do?  
THE DOCTOR: Do? Stop Tannis. I didn't realise until it was too late - he's a
Time Lord. Why didn't you tell us there was another?  
THE KINGMAKER: Tell you? That is not my role.  
THE DOCTOR: Who is he? What does he want?  
THE KINGMAKER: He is the slow agent. The darkness to counter the age of light.  
THE DOCTOR: Tannis? I can't believe it.  
THE KINGMAKER: There can be no positive without a negative. Did you forget?
You and your kind could not have existed, were it not for the presence of a
balancing force.  
THE DOCTOR: But, if there are several of us and one of him, his abilities must
be immeasurable.  
THE KINGMAKER: Not only his.  
THE DOCTOR: He's been amassing power, weapons, invading planets. He has a
whole system at his command, butchering and murdering.  
THE KINGMAKER: The morality of linear beings is not my concern. He has
violated no law of Time. His actions can draw no sanction from me.  
THE DOCTOR: Violated no...? He killed my ... He's insane. If you don't do
something to stop him, he'll be too powerful even for you.  
THE KINGMAKER: Then so be it. I cannot act to prevent a violation, only to
stop one. What must be, must be. Time must be left to its own devices. Your
passions bring you here, not logic. Friendship shades the truth from reason's
view.  
  
TRACK 7 - A FRIEND IS LOST  
  
THE KINGMAKER: Tannis is not the cause of the distortions.  
THE DOCTOR: But who ... who's causing them?  
THE KINGMAKER: That is why I summoned you here. The danger always lurks in the
uncertainty of the half-light. It is rarely in the deep darkness.  
THE DOCTOR: The Minister? No. He would never do such an immoral...  
THE KINGMAKER: Morality is not in question. Any violation even born of good
intention is still a violation. He sought to help as you did, aeons ago, but
it was not his place to do so.  
THE DOCTOR: Oh no. I was blind and now...  
THE KINGMAKER: And now ... you must destroy your friend. There is no
alternative. If you do not make the sacrifice, the universe will pay the
price.  
THE DOCTOR: There must be another way.  
THE KINGMAKER: He is lost. You must end the torment. You walk the sword's
edge. I do not envy you. Now, go. Truth-seeker. We will not meet again.  
THE DOCTOR: No.  
  
TRACK 8 - TWO FRIENDS ARE LOST  
  
GOLCRUM: Casmus? Mister Casmus, hello there. Oh. Oh ... Oh ... Oh no.  
ACE: Casmus? Hello-o? Casmus?  
GOLCRUM: Ace, he's over here, but...  
ACE: Did you find him? What is it?  
GOLCRUM: Ace...  
ACE: Is he all right?  
GOLCRUM: Don't look.  
ACE: No! No!  
GOLCRUM: I'm sorry, he's...  
ACE: He can't be gone. Who can have done this? He was just an old man.  
GOLCRUM: He was more than that to me. He gave me a ... a purpose.  
ACE: (tearful) I don't know what to do. What do we do now?  
GOLCRUM: I suppose, we find out who did it.  
THE DOCTOR: Tannis did it.  
ACE: Doctor!  
(Ace is now reunited with the Doctor - the other Doctor.)  
THE DOCTOR: Hello, Ace.  
ACE: He said he'd be here.  
THE DOCTOR: The least of him is here. Just his body.  
ACE: I failed him.  
THE DOCTOR: We all failed that test.  
ACE: I misused my power. I bent time. I corrupted it to save myself. I killed
everybody.  
THE DOCTOR: That was an illusion. Spirits and phantoms.  
ACE: No, not them. I tried to stop the spirits and I killed the people too.  
THE DOCTOR: Ace, those people _were_ the spirits. There's nothing living on
the surface of Anima Persis, hasn't been for hundreds of years. You don't have
that power, not yet. You take that memory with you wherever you go.  
ACE: But I thought ... What about my wand?  
THE DOCTOR: Wand?  
ACE: Yes, Casmus gave me a wand.  
THE DOCTOR: Ah. Tell me, what does your wand look like to you?  
ACE: A stick.  
THE DOCTOR: A stick.  
ACE: (laugh) Just a stick. (Laughs.) Wand. Casmus's last practical joke. I
fell for it, old man.  
GOLCRUM: A stick. (Laughs.) I don't get it.  
ACE: Doctor, this is Golcrum. He used to be my jailer.  
THE DOCTOR: Wonderful. How do you do?  
GOLCRUM: You look a bit tired, Doctor. I suggest a rest.  
THE DOCTOR: A rest is for criminals.  
ACE: Doctor, where's Antimony?  
THE DOCTOR: He ... had...  
ACE: How?  
THE DOCTOR: Tannis. Tannis is a Time Lord.  
ACE: What? That doesn't make sense. Why would he fight wars if he could
just...?  
THE DOCTOR: He knew if we found out what he was, the other Time Lords would
stop him. He couldn't defeat us if ... if we were acting together, so he
distracted us one by one, split us up, killed those he could get away with
killing, and when one of us did go astray, he manipulated him. And he left
both of us alive, so one would destroy the other. Now, I have no choice.  
ACE: But ... you mean all that invasion and the war was just to distract the
Time Lords?  
THE DOCTOR: I don't think so entirely. He still wanted to conquer the
universe. Just had to do it in the slow way, until now. Two irons in the fire.  
ACE: Wait a minute. Where do I fit in?  
THE DOCTOR: You'll see. Somewhere after me, I should think.  
ACE: Oh, spare me from cryptic old men. So Doctor, what do we do? What do we
do now?  
THE DOCTOR: We save the universe. I want you to go and see our friends,
they'll arrange a welcoming party for Tannis, and maybe your jailer can help
you.  
ACE: He's heading for Earth, isn't he?  
THE DOCTOR: Mm. You _have_ come a long way.  
ACE: What about you?  
THE DOCTOR: This is something I have to do alone.  
  
TRACK 9 - THREE OLD FRIENDS ON SANTINY  
  
(Flashback scenes.)  
DOCTOR CAIN: Black holes.  
THE DOCTOR: It's a Time Lord misusing his abilities on a grand scale.  
SPEEDWELL: the sort of thing someone would want to cover up?  
ACE: To distract the Time Lords.  
THE DOCTOR: He couldn't defeat us if we were acting together, so he distracted
us one by one. Split us up.  
THE DOCTOR: What is this for?  
THE DOCTOR: Killed those he could get away with killing, and when one of us
did go astray...  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: You really think we can detach ourselves completely.  
THE DOCTOR: He manipulated him.  
THE KINGMAKER: Any violation even born of good intention is still a violation.  
ANTIMONY: Couldn't it be the Minister?  
THE KINGMAKER: Friendship shades the truth from reason's view.  
THE DOCTOR: No, the Minister's one of ours, there's no evil in him.  
And he left both of us alive, so one would destroy the other.  
THE DOCTOR: Who's behind this?  
NESSICAN: You don't know, Time Lord? Then you'll only know when it's too late.  
THE KINGMAKER: You must destroy your friend.  
  
TRACK 10 - ON FORTUNE FALLS  
  
(Whistling wind as though from a mountaintop.)  
THE DOCTOR: Minister, old friend. Minister.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Get out. Go away, I don't want to talk to you.  
THE DOCTOR: Come down.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Keep away from me!  
(Thunder.)  
THE DOCTOR: You must see reason. Tannis is running amok. I need your help.
He's a Time Lord...  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Tannis? Tannis? Blood and guns and idiots marching in
lines, I'm ... I'm sick of this. Get out!  
(Thunder.)  
THE DOCTOR: Stop. Think what you're doing. This must stop!  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I don't care. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of watching
them die, and talking to two-faced rubbish. We can stop the killing. Why do we
have to sit by and watch? We can stop the pain. Why?  
(Thunder.)  
THE DOCTOR: Have you stopped the killing here? The plain below is strewn with
bodies. How many killings did you stop? This is against everything we were.
It's not our place to interfere like this.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: Go back and leave me be.  
THE DOCTOR: You've corrupted Time. You must listen to me.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I want it to stop. Get away or I'll kill you too. I'll
kill you all. Plagues and bombs and blood. She was just trying to stop them.  
THE DOCTOR: Enough! I don't have time for this. I am a God of the Fourth. Your
Tardis is revoked!  
(Thunder.)  
THE DOCTOR: Now, I'm going to try to stop this. You, face yourself.  
THE MINISTER OF CHANCE: I wanted it to stop. I just wanted it to stop. Make it
stop. What have I done? What have I done.  
  
TRACK 11 - THE PROBE  
  
(Called Mission Control in the online version, here David Soul is given the
more sensible name of Bob ... which they then spoil by having him address the
woman Barbara beside him as Barb.)  
BOB: Look Barb, the Voyager probe. That is bull.  
WOMAN: Uh-huh...  
BOB: Because if they could understand that - I mean, think about it, Barb. If
they were advanced enough to understand, then they would have already
contacted us now, wouldn't they?  
WOMAN: Listen. You know what? You so need a hobby.  
BOB: I know, and sometimes I swear, Bar... Look, I'm serious.  
WOMAN: Uh-huh...  
BOB: Think about it. Who says they have eyes? Who says they can recognise what
pictures are? You send them Mozart - are you sure they can hear? That they
have ... there have been thousands, I repeat, thousands of confirmed sightings
of aliens, and they are all grey little itty-bitty guys and none of them had
anything to hang ear-rings on to. No, no, no, no - no, they're here already.  
WOMAN: Uh-huh.  
BOB: And the Feds are trying to cover it up.  
WOMAN: Okay, so how do they get here if they don't have eyes? I mean, what -
do they have a separate ship for a seeing eye dog?  
BOB: Oh, Barbara...  
(Alarm.)  
WOMAN: I mean...  
BOB: Oh boy. Oh boy. Check this out. Check ... This is weird.  
WOMAN: That can't be right. Sir, you'd better come and look at this right
away.  
MAN: Honey? I'll be right back. Martin? I want two sugars, none of that Stadia
crap. What is it?  
(Tapping on keyboard.)  
MAN: Where in the hell did they come from? What the hell are they? Comets?  
BOB: Too fast for comets, sir. They're altering course. They just crossed the
solar system in under a minute.  
WOMAN: Oh my God, they've crossed the solar system in under a minute.  
WOMAN: They're going to collide with the Earth!  
BOB: No, no, no, no, no, they're in orbit. I don't believe this is happening.
Christmas!  
MAN: All right everybody, calm down. Martin, forget the sugar. Get me the
President.  
  
TRACK 12 - A GREAT LEADER AND A PRESIDENT  
  
(Police siren in the background.)  
MAN: Mister President, sir. It's Mission Control, NASA. Confirmed. We have
First Contact. They're broadcasting on TV and radio and everything else.  
PILOT: Earth, you have the honour of being addressed by General Tannis,
supreme commander of the defence forces of the Canisian Suns. You will kneel.  
(THE PRESIDENT looks and sounds like George Bush.)  
THE PRESIDENT: Man. Greetings. We welcome you to Earth in a spirit of peace
and friendship.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Thank you. In return, we are willing to accept your total
surrender.  
THE PRESIDENT: Surre...?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Your Stone Age planet is surrounded by my fleet. I've just
flattened another backward planet, and I rather feel like flattening yours.
Now, think carefully. Would you like me to blow up a few cities to convince
you?  
MAN: Er - try stalling, sir?  
THE PRESIDENT: (slowly) Er, sir, may I suggest that we arrange a meeting to...  
GENERAL TANNIS: (sighing) Gunship, prepare a tectonic bomb.  
THE PRESIDENT: What the hell is this, Plan Asshole From Outer Space? Activate
the missile defence system.  
MAN: We did, sir. It missed.  
GENERAL TANNIS: There. That one on the island. What is that city?  
PILOT: London, sir. A provincial capital.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Then target that city.  
THE PRESIDENT: Sir, I think you misunderstand.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Pilot, what is the population of the city of London?  
PILOT: Around eight million, sir.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Now, Mister President.  
(Phone rings.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: Do I take it that you and your entire planet surrender?  
(Receiver lifted.)  
MAN: Sir, it's the Prime Minister from London, sir.  
(Silence.)  
MAN: In England, sir?  
THE PRESIDENT: Right.  
THE PRIME MINISTER: Mister President, stand by. We have counter measures.  
THE PRESIDENT: Counter measures? What the hell kind of counter measures?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Gunship, fire tectonic bomb.  
THE PRIME MINISTER: Activate counter measures.  
  
TRACK 13 - A WARM WELCOME  
  
(Explosion.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: What was that?  
PILOT: Unknown, sir. Sir, the targeting ship has been hit. Confirm. The gun
ship has been destroyed.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Destroyed? By what?  
PILOT: Sir, the targeting system is inactive. The bomb exploded on launch.  
GENERAL TANNIS: What?  
MAN: (radio) Small shuttle fleet breaking cover from behind the Moon, sir.  
PILOT: They have no ship to ship weaponry, sir.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Pathetic. (Loudspeaker) Enemy craft, you have the honour of
being addressed by his Excellency General Tannis, supreme commander of the
defence forces of the...  
(Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart of UNIT interrupts)  
THE BRIGADIER: Enemy craft, you have the misfortune of being addressed by the
Brigadier. Now, get out of my solar system.  
(Explosion.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: Open fire, stern guns.  
PILOT: No response, General.  
GENERAL TANNIS: What?  
(Electronic warbling.)  
PILOT: It's a generative virus, sir. It's worse than the one on Santiny. It
... it looks like it came from one of our own transmitters.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Nessican.  
PILOT: They knew we were coming.  
GENERAL TANNIS: But how did they...? The Doctor. So it ends here.  
PILOT: We're being boarded, sir.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Then evacuate to the landing craft immediately. We still have
an army. (Communicator) All craft, this is General Tannis. Invasion protocol.
Prepare to land.  
  
(Soaring.)  
PILOT: This is the Fleet Pilot to all troop carriers. On landing we will
proceed to the capital and secure the city. We do not expect planned
resistance but be on your guard.  
COMPUTER: Invasion protocol. Invasion protocol.  
  
MAN: (radio) They're landing on Salisbury Plain.  
SPEEDWELL: Just as the Doctor ordered. All right, lads. We wait until every
ship has landed, then the jets will make one bomb run. The moment the doors of
those ships open artillery will fire one volley at each ship, then we break
cover and move in.  
COMPUTER: Stand by to disembark.  
PILOT: Open stairwell doors, prepare to disembark.  
(Doors glide open.)  
COMPUTER: Stand by to disembark.  
(Soaring jets. Explosions.)  
SPEEDWELL: Fire one. Forward!  
PILOT: Return fire. Forward!  
(Battle.)  
PILOT: General, they were prepared. General, your orders, sir.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Find the Doctor at all costs.  
PILOT: But the Doctor, General? Are you injured? I mean the troops, sir.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh, damn the troops. Find the Time Lord. Now he's here it
won't matter.  
PILOT: What's a Time Lord? General! General!  
SPEEDWELL: It's Lieutenant-Colonel actually, sir.  
(PILOT shot. Battle continues.)  
  
TRACK 14 - TEATIME  
  
THE BRIGADIER: This is the Brigadier. Where are you? Over.  
ACE: Salisbury Plain. What's happening?  
THE BRIGADIER: Mission accomplished. We have boarded or destroyed all the
remaining orbital vessels.  
ACE: Good. We need you on the ground now. Please land as soon as possible.
Follow the Tardis's signal. I should be easy to find.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh, you were.  
ACE: Tannis!  
(Shot.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: (command voice) "Stop!" (Normal voice) I'll take that, thank
you.  
(Thump. ACE gasps.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh, that felt good. Must do it more often. After all, why have
the power if you can't use it?  
THE DOCTOR: (echoed) And you haven't used it, have you, Tannis?  
GENERAL TANNIS: Ah. And they say there's never a doctor when you need one. I
was just murdering your screamer here, you'll remember the form.  
THE DOCTOR: You broke no Laws of Time, so we wouldn't find you and we wouldn't
stop you. You never used your power, but you manipulated others so that one
day you would be able to, with impunity, and look how even the thought of that
much power has twisted you.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Oh - oh, you're right. Perhaps you'd better get arrested and
turn my people against me. Shouldn't take more than fifty years. The last of
the friendly Time Lords. Oh - apart from our do-it-yourself Time Lord of the
future here. (Command voice) "Die, slowly."  
(ACE chokes.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: Well, Doctor? Aren't you going to stop me? Of course you're
not. You see, little girl, the Doctor here could save you. He could tell me to
die, and I would, he could tell a ship to explode and it would, but he won't.
He won't do it on principle. The greatest of the Time Lords. He let his
precious metal boy die for nothing, and he'll let you die for nothing. And
then he'll die for nothing, all because he won't break the law on principle.
That's what you're dying for. Don't kid yourself. If he was interested in the
common good, he'd have killed himself long ago. He's just running around the
universe trying to assuage a guilty conscience.  
THE DOCTOR: (Command voice) "Put her down."  
(ACE sighs with relief.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: Doctor. You? You - you can't.  
THE DOCTOR: Can't I? Why have the power if you can't use it?  
GENERAL TANNIS: You won't violate the code.  
THE DOCTOR: We held this path for millennia. We held this path so that even if
all of us were killed, one of us might stand here and stop an abomination like
you from taking over the universe. This is what Casmus used to call teatime.  
GENERAL TANNIS: Bluff. You won't do it. (Command voice) "Die!"  
(Thunder.)  
THE DOCTOR: I don't think so. We don't have any place in this future, Tannis.
It's their universe now. We can't walk amongst them - we never really could.
We tried to be like them, or not to be like them, or to hide from them, and
you became something less than them. They don't need our guidance any more,
and they won't put up with your force.  
ACE: Doctor, what are you talking about?  
THE DOCTOR: I think ... I'm tired. I'm tired, Ace.  
GENERAL TANNIS: You're bluffing. You won't interfere with Time.  
THE DOCTOR: Oh, come on, Tannis. If I just let you kill me, I couldn't live
with myself. But Time must be left to its own devices.  
GENERAL TANNIS: It must be left to its own devices. It must.  
THE DOCTOR: But you see, Tannis, I am one of those devices.  
(Voices muttering in the background, gentle chanting.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: But ... but you'll disrupt the course of Time. (Echoed) No!  
THE DOCTOR: (Command voice) "I am the course of Time. I am a God of the
Fourth. Now ... die."  
GENERAL TANNIS: But ... but you'll die too. You'll die too.  
THE DOCTOR: I've been dead before.  
ACE: Doctor!  
(Thunderbolts as GENERAL TANNIS cries out.)  
GENERAL TANNIS: No...!  
(Singing male voice choir in the background, then silence apart from the
howling wind.)  
  
TRACK 15 - WE ALWAYS WIN  
  
(Cheering.)  
GOLCRUM: Any more injuries, Captain?  
SPEEDWELL: Over there, Mister Golcrum. Follow the field medics.  
GOLCRUM: Brilliant. I love this planet.  
SPEEDWELL: Try not to look too happy about it.  
THE BRIGADIER: Lieutenant-Colonel. Where are they?  
SPEEDWELL: There you are, sir. We've won, sir. We've won! (Laughs.)  
THE BRIGADIER: Pull yourself together, Lieutenant-Colonel. You're a soldier,
not a cheerleader. Of course we've won. We always win.  
SPEEDWELL: I'm sorry sir, I don't know what came over me.  
THE BRIGADIER: Hmm. I'll overlook it on this occasion. Well, let's get teams
onto these craft immediately, see if we can't make use of their technology.
This is a new age, Lieutenant-Colonel. You'll be flying inter-galactic from
now on.  
SPEEDWELL: I like the sound of that, sir. Hello, Miss. Well, we've won.  
THE BRIGADIER: Are you all right? Where's the Doctor?  
ACE: He...  
SPEEDWELL: Is he all right?  
ACE: He's gone.  
  
TRACK 16 - TWILIGHT  
  
ACE: Is he dead?  
THE KINGMAKER: Did you find his body?  
ACE: No.  
THE KINGMAKER: Child, people do not last, only thoughts. For who can kill a
thought that was never alive? The tension was created and resolved. The Time
Lords walk the worlds no more. Now, a new age begins. New adventure beckons.
If you hold the light, new darkness will grow to oppose it. Do you wish me to
confer on you that light?  
ACE: It's your place to decide that.  
THE KINGMAKER: No. It is yours. I am far removed from where that decision will
make any difference. I place that power in your hands. If the faith of the
Doctor and of Casmus was not misplaced, you will know what to do. Farewell,
child. We will meet again.  
ACE: Yes. We will.  
(Walking off. Gentle bird-song.)  
  
CASMUS: Once, long ago, on an island in a sea of clouds, there was a land
where giants walked. And the giants lived amongst the other peoples of that
land. And they used their great strength to help them ... until twilight fell.
Until Death came to Time.  
(The incidental music which has been playing in the background - Mussorgsky's
"Night Of The Bare Mountain" - concludes.)
