**The Sound of Drums**  
  
Original Airdate: 23 Jun, 2007  

**[Alleyway]**

(A vortex appears, blowing the rubbish around, followed by the Doctor, Jack
and Martha.)  
MARTHA: Oh, my head.  
DOCTOR: Time travel without a capsule. That's a killer.

**[Street]**

JACK: Still, at least we made it. Earth, twenty first century by the looks of
it. Talk about lucky.  
DOCTOR: That wasn't luck, that was me.

**[Yana's laboratory]**

(A few moments earlier, trying to keep out the Futurekind whilst using the
sonic screwdriver on Jack's vortex manipulator bracelet.)  
DOCTOR: Hold still! Don't move! Hold it still!  
JACK: I'm telling you, it's broken. It hasn't worked for years.  
DOCTOR: That's because you didn't have me. Martha, grab hold, now!  
(With everyone holding on to the manipulator, they vanish.)

**[Street]**

JACK: The moral is, if you're going to get stuck at the end of the universe,
get stuck with an ex-Time Agent and his vortex manipulator.  
MARTHA: But this Master bloke, he's got the Tardis. He could be anywhere in
time and space.  
DOCTOR: No, he's here. Trust me.  
MARTHA: Who is he, anyway? And that voice at the end, that wasn't the
Professor.  
JACK: If the Master's a Time Lord, then he must have regenerated.  
MARTHA: What does that mean?  
JACK: It means he's changed his face, voice, body, everything. New man.  
(A beggar is tapping the rhythm of the start of the old Who theme on his tin
mug. Di di di dum di di di dum.)  
MARTHA: Then how are we going to find him?  
DOCTOR: I'll know him, the moment I see him. Time Lords always do.  
MARTHA: But hold on. If he could be anyone, we missed the election. But it
can't be.  
(A series of public television screens on lamp posts are broadcasting the
news.)  
NEWSREADER [on screen]: Mister Saxon has returned from the Palace and is
greeting the crowd inside Saxon Headquarters.  
(The new Prime Minister is walking down steps with his wife.)  
MARTHA: I said I knew that voice. When he spoke inside the Tardis. I've heard
that voice hundreds of times. I've seen him. We all have. That was the voice
of Harold Saxon.  
DOCTOR: That's him. He's Prime Minister.  
PHOTOGRAPHER [on screen]: Mister Saxon, this way, sir. Come on, kiss for the
lady, sir.  
DOCTOR: The Master is Prime Minister of Great Britain. The Master and his
wife?

**[Outside Saxon HQ]**

MASTER: This country has been sick. This country needs healing. This country
needs medicine.

**[Street]**

MASTER [on screen]: In fact, I'd go so far as to say that what this country
really needs right now, is a Doctor.

**[10 Downing Street]**

(The Master and Lucy Saxon are walking along a corridor whilst aides hand him
various reports.)  
WOMAN: Finance report, sir.  
WOMAN 2: Military protocol, sir.  
WOMAN 3: EC directive, sir.  
MAN: Annual budget, sir.  
MAN 2: Policy recommendations.  
(They arrive outside the Cabinet Room.)  
LUCY: I'm so proud of you, Harry.  
(The Master kisses her.)  
MASTER: Bless.  
TISH: Sir. If you don't mind me asking. I'm sorry, but it's all a bit new.
What exactly do you want me to do?  
MASTER: Oh yes, what was it?  
TISH: Tish. Letitia Jones.  
MASTER: Tish. Well then, Tish, you just stand there and look gorgeous.

**[Cabinet Room]**

(The full Cabinet are assembled.)  
MASTER: A glorious day. Downing Street rebuilt, the Cabinet in session. Let
the work of government begin.  
(He throws the files he has just been given into the air.)  
MASTER: Oh, go on. Crack a smile. It's funny, isn't it? Albert, funny? No?
Little bit?  
DUMFRIES: Very funny, sir. But if we could get down to business, there is the
matter of policy, of which we have very little.  
MASTER: No, no, no, no. Before we start all that, I just want to say thank
you. Thank you, one and all. You ugly, fat faced bunch of wet, snivelling
traitors.  
DUMFRIES: Yes, quite, very funny. But I think  
MASTER: No. No, that wasn't funny. You see, I'm not making myself very clear.
Funny is like this.  
(Big grin, wide eyes.)  
MASTER: Not funny is like this.  
(Deep scowl and frown.)  
MASTER: And right now, I'm not like (grin) I'm like (frown) because you are
traitors. Yes, you are! As soon as you saw the vote swinging my way, you
abandoned your parties and you jumped on the Saxon bandwagon. So this is your
reward.  
(The Master puts on an oxygen mask.)  
DUMFRIES: Excuse me, Prime Minister. Do you mind my asking, what is that?  
MASTER: (muffled) It's a gas mask.  
DUMFRIES: I beg your pardon?  
MASTER: It's a gas mask.  
DUMFRIES: Yes, but, er, why are you wearing it?  
MASTER: (muffled) Well, because of the gas.  
DUMFRIES: I'm sorry?  
MASTER: Because of the gas.  
DUMFRIES: What gas?  
MASTER: (muffled) This gas.  
(The conference telephone sets pop up and squirt gas at the Cabinet and
officials.)  
DUMFRIES: You're insane!  
(The Master gives the thumbs up sign as Dumfries and the rest of his
colleagues die, then starts tapping out that famous rhythm on the table.)

**[Martha's home]**

MARTHA: Home.  
DOCTOR: What have you got? Computer, laptop, anything. Jack, who are you
phoning? You can't tell anyone we're here.  
JACK: Just some friends of mine, but there's no reply.  
(Martha fetches her laptop.)  
MARTHA: Here you go. Any good?  
JACK: I can show you the Saxon websites. He's been around for ages.  
MARTHA: That's so weird though. It's the day after the election. That's only
four days after I met you.  
DOCTOR: We went flying all around the universe while he was here all the time.  
MARTHA: You going to tell us who he is?  
DOCTOR: He's a Time Lord.  
MARTHA: What about the rest of it? I mean, who'd call himself the Master?  
DOCTOR: That's all you need to know. Come on, show me Harold Saxon.  
(Martha switches on her answering machine.)  
TISH [on machine]: Martha, where are you? I've got this new job. You won't
believe it. It's weird. They just phoned me up out of the blue. I'm working
for  
(Martha turns it off again.)  
MARTHA: Oh, like it matters.

**[Cabinet Office]**

(A woman walks through, brandishing a newspaper article.)  
TISH: I'm sorry, but you're not allowed in  
VIVIEN: Harold Saxon, A Modern Churchill. It's the definitive think piece on
the man himself. Oh, come on, sweetheart. You must've read it.  
TISH: Not really. Sorry, I'm new.  
VIVIEN: Mister Saxon does like a pretty face, but I'm here to see Mrs Saxon.  
TISH: You can't just go barging in.

**[Drawing room]**

(Meant to be the White Drawing Room, for private use of the PM and his family,
presumably.)  
VIVIEN: Mrs Saxon. Vivien Rook, Sunday Mirror. You've heard of me.  
LUCY: Oh, can't I just have an hour to myself? It's been a hell of a day.  
VIVIEN: Oh, strike while the iron's hot, that's what I say, Lucy. I can call
you Lucy, can't I? Now, everyone's talking about Harold Saxon, but I thought,
What about the wife? All I need is twenty minutes.  
LUCY: Oh, I think maybe we should wait.  
VIVIEN: The headline's waiting to print. The Power Behind the Throne.  
LUCY: Really?  
VIVIEN: Britain's First Lady.  
LUCY: Gosh.  
VIVIEN: Front page.  
LUCY: Oh. Well, I suppose. Oh, go on then. Twenty minutes.  
VIVIEN: Excellent! Thank you. Go, go, what was it? Er, Tish. Now you can leave
us alone.  
(Vivien gives Tish her coat.)  
TISH: No, but I'm supposed to sit in?  
VIVIEN: No, no, it's only a profile piece. You know, hair and clothes and
nonsense. There's a good girl. Out you go. That's it.  
(Tish is pushed out of the room and the door shut in her face.)  
VIVIEN: Mrs Saxon, I have reason to believe that you're in very great danger.
All of us, in fact. Not just the country, but the whole world. No, I beg of
you, hear me out.  
LUCY: What are you talking about?  
VIVIEN: Your husband is not who he says he is. I'm sorry, but it's a lie.
Everything's a lie.

**[Martha's home]**

SHARON OSBOURNE [on laptop]: I'm voting Saxon. He can tick my box any day.  
McFLY [on laptop]: Vote Saxon! Go Harry!  
ANN WIDDECOMBE [on laptop]: I think Mister Saxon is exactly what this country
needs. He's a very fine man. And he's handsome too.  
JACK: Former Minister of Defence. First came to prominence when he shot down
the Racnoss on Christmas Eve. Nice work, by the way.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thanks.  
MARTHA: But he goes back years. He's famous. Everyone knows his story. Look.
Cambridge University, Rugby blue. Won the Athletics thing. Wrote a novel, went
into business, marriage, everything. He's got a whole life.

**[Drawing room]**

VIVIEN: All of it. The school days, his degree, even his mother and father,
it's all invented. Look, Harold Saxon never went to Cambridge. There was no
Harold Saxon. The thing is, it's obvious. The forgery is screaming out and yet
no one can see it. It's as if he's mesmerized the entire world.  
LUCY: I think perhaps you should leave now.  
VIVIEN: Eighteen months ago, he became real. This is his first, honest to God
appearance, just after the downfall of Harriet Jones. And at the exact same
time, they launched the Archangel Network.  
LUCY: Mrs Rook, now stop it.  
VIVIEN: Even now they've said that the Cabinet has gone into seclusion. I
mean, what does that mean, seclusion?  
LUCY: How should I know?  
VIVIEN: But I've got plenty of research on you. Yes, good family, Roedean, not
especially bright but essentially harmless. And that's why I'm asking you,
Lucy. I am begging you. If you have seen anything, heard anything, even the
slightest thing that would give you cause to doubt him?  
LUCY: I think  
VIVIEN: Yes?  
LUCY: There was a time when we first met, I wondered. But he was so good to my
father, and he said.  
VIVIEN: What? Just tell me, sweetheart.  
LUCY: The thing is, I made my choice.  
VIVIEN: I'm sorry?  
LUCY: For better or for worse. Isn't that right, Harry?  
MASTER: My faithful companion.  
VIVIEN: Mister Saxon. Prime Minister, I was just having a little joke with
poor little Lucy. I didn't mean.  
MASTER: Oh, but you're absolutely right. Harold Saxon doesn't exist.  
VIVIEN: Then tell me. Who are you?  
MASTER: I am the Master and these are my friends.  
(Four spheres pop into existence and orbit his head.)  
VIVIEN: I'm sorry?  
MASTER: Can't you hear it, Mrs Rook?  
VIVIEN: What do you mean?  
MASTER: The drumbeat. The drums coming closer and closer.  
(Spikes or thin blades now stick out from the spheres.)  
FEMALE SPHERE: The lady doesn't like us.  
MALE SPHERE: Silly lady.  
VIVIEN: No.  
MALE SPHERE: Dead lady.

**[Outside the Drawing room]**

(Lucy and the Master run out as the spheres close in on Vivien and she
screams. After a few moments, the Master opens the door again but the scream
is continuing. He shuts it then opens it once more. Still screaming.)  
LUCY: Oh, but she knew. Harry, she knew everything. You promised. You said
Archangel was one hundred percent.  
MASTER: Ninety nine, ninety eight?  
LUCY: But if she's asking questions, then who else? How much time have we got?  
(The Master hugs Lucy.)  
MASTER: Tomorrow morning. I promise. That's when everything ends.

**[Martha's home]**

(Jack is making them mugs of tea.)  
JACK: But he's got the Tardis. Maybe the Master went back in time and has been
living here for decades.  
DOCTOR: No.  
JACK: Why not? Worked for me.  
DOCTOR: When he was stealing the Tardis, the only thing I could do was fuse
the coordinates. I locked them permanently. He can only travel between the
year one hundred trillion and the last place the Tardis landed. Which is right
here, right now.  
JACK: Yeah, but a little leeway?  
DOCTOR: Well, eighteen months, tops. The most he could have been here is
eighteen months. So how has he managed all this? The Master was always sort of
hypnotic, but this is on a massive scale.  
MARTHA: I was going to vote for him.  
DOCTOR: Really?  
MARTHA: Well, it was before I even met you. And I liked him.  
JACK: Me too.  
DOCTOR: Why do you say that? What was his policy? What did he stand for?  
MARTHA: I don't know. He always sounded good.  
(She starts tapping the rhythm.)  
MARTHA: Like you could trust him. Just nice. He spoke about. I can't really
remember, but it was good. Just the sound of his voice.  
DOCTOR: What's that?  
MARTHA: What?  
DOCTOR: That. That tapping, that rhythm. What are you doing?  
MARTHA: I don't know. It's nothing. It's just, I don't know.  
(A fanfare blares out from the laptop and a pop up says Saxon Broadcast All
Channels. The Doctor turns on the TV.)  
DOCTOR: Our lord and master is speaking to his kingdom.  
MASTER [on TV]: Britain, Britain, Britain.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: What extraordinary times we've had. Just a few years ago, this world
was so small. And then they came, out of the unknown, falling from the skies.
You've seen it happen.

**[Martha's home]**

(Over the appropriate film clips.)  
MASTER [OC]: Big Ben destroyed. A spaceship over London. All those ghosts and
metal men. The Christmas star that came to kill.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: Time and time again, and the government told you nothing.  
(Lucy crosses her fingers.)

**[Martha's home]**

MASTER [on TV]: Well, not me. Not Harold Saxon. Because my purpose

**[Cabinet room]**

(Tish is also present.)  
MASTER: Here today is to tell you this. Citizens of Great Britain, I have been
contacted.

**[Martha's home]**

MASTER [on TV]: A message for humanity, from beyond the stars.  
FEMALE SPHERE: People of the Earth,

**[Cabinet room]**

FEMALE SPHERE [OC]: We come in peace. We bring great gifts.

**[Martha's home]**

FEMALE SPHERE [on TV]: We bring technology and wisdom and protection. And all
we ask in return is your friendship.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: Ooo, sweet. And this species has identified itself.

**[Martha's home]**

MASTER [on TV]: They are called the Toclafane.  
DOCTOR: What?  
MASTER [on TV]: And tomorrow morning, they will appear. Not in secret, but to
all of you. Diplomatic relations with a new species

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: Will begin. Tomorrow, we take our place in the universe. Every man,
woman and child. Every teacher and chemist and lorry driver and farmer. Oh, I
don't know, every medical student?

**[Martha's home]**

(The Doctor turns to look at Martha, then turns the big old cathode ray tube
TV around to see sticks of explosive strapped to the back.)  
DOCTOR: Out!  
(The Doctor grabs the laptop and they run out into the street.)

**[Outside Martha's home]**

(The first floor of the converted house explodes with a massive fireball
smashing the windows.)  
DOCTOR: All right?  
JACK: Fine, yeah, fine.  
DOCTOR: Martha? What are you doing?  
(Martha is dialing on her mobile phone.)  
MARTHA: He knows about me. What about my family?  
DOCTOR: Don't tell them anything.  
MARTHA: I'll do what I like. Mum? Oh my God

**[Francine's home]**

MARTHA [OC]: You're there.  
FRANCINE: Of course I'm here, sweetheart.

**[Outside Martha's home]**

FRANCINE [OC]: You all right?  
MARTHA: I'm fine. I'm fine. Mum

**[Francine's home]**

MARTHA [OC]: Has there been anyone asking about me?  
(The woman in black is listening in to the call.)

**[Outside Martha's home]**

FRANCINE [OC]: Martha, I think perhaps you should come round.  
MARTHA: I can't. Not now.

**[Francine's home]**

FRANCINE: No, but it's your father. We've been talking and

**[Outside Martha's home]**

FRANCINE [OC]: We thought we might give it another go.

**[Francine's home]**

MARTHA [OC]: Don't be so daft. Since when?  
FRANCINE: Just come around.

**[Outside Martha's home]**

FRANCINE [OC]: Come to the house. We can

**[Francine's home]**

FRANCINE: Celebrate.  
MARTHA [OC]: You said you'd

**[Outside Martha's home]**

MARTHA: Never get back with him in a million years.

**[Francine's home]**

FRANCINE: Ask him yourself.  
CLIVE: Martha, it's me.

**[Outside Martha's home]**

MARTHA: Dad, what are you doing there?  
CLIVE [OC]: Like your mother said.

**[Francine's home]**

CLIVE: Come round. We can explain everything.

**[Outside Martha's home]**

MARTHA: Dad? Just say

**[Francine's home]**

MARTHA [OC]: Yes or no.

**[Outside Martha's home]**

MARTHA: Is there someone else there?

**[Francine's home]**

CLIVE: Yes! Just run!  
FRANCINE: Clive!  
CLIVE: Listen to me! Just run! I don't know who they are!  
(Two men in black grab Clive as he runs along the hallway.)  
FRANCINE: We're trying to help her!

**[Outside Martha's home]**

FRANCINE [OC]: Martha, don't listen to him!  
MARTHA: Dad? What's going on? Dad?

**[Francine's house]**

FRANCINE: We've got to get Martha away from him!

**[Outside Martha's home]**

MARTHA: We've got to help them.  
DOCTOR: That's exactly what they want. It's a trap!  
(Martha goes to her Vauxhall Corsa.)  
MARTHA: I don't care.  
(The Doctor gets in the front seat, and Jack in the back.)

**[Outside Francine's home]**

(The police bundle Clive into a van.)  
CLIVE: Get off! It's your fault! All of you! You voted Saxon! You did this!

**[Martha's car]**

(Martha speeds down the road, narrowly avoiding oncoming traffic.)  
DOCTOR: Corner!

**[Outside Francine's home]**

DEXTER: Mister Saxon, we have Condition Red on the Jones plan. We're taking
them in. All of them.  
FRANCINE: But I was helping you!

**[Martha's car]**

(Martha is making a phone call, hands free.)  
MARTHA: Come on, Tish. Pick up.

**[10 Downing Street]**

TISH: Martha, I can't talk right now. We just made first contact. Did you see?  
(Two men grab Tish's arms and carry her backwards.)

**[Martha's car]**

TISH [OC]: What are you doing?

**[10 Downing Street]**

TISH: Get off! Linda, tell them!

**[Martha's car]**

MARTHA: What's happening? Tish! It's your fault. It's all your fault!

**[Outside Francine's home]**

(The men are trying to get Francine into the police van when Martha drives
up.)  
FRANCINE: I was helping you! Get off me! Martha, get out of here! Get out!  
DEXTER: Target identified.  
(Armed police take up position.)  
DOCTOR: Martha, reverse.  
DEXTER: Take aim.  
DOCTOR: Get out, now!  
DEXTER: Fire!  
(Martha turns the car round as bullets slam into it.)  
JACK: Move it!  
(The rear window is shattered as they drive away.)  
DEXTER: Take them away.

**[Martha's car]**

MARTHA: The only place we can go planet Earth. Great!  
DOCTOR: Careful! JACK: Martha, listen to me. Do as I say. We've got to ditch
this car. Pull over. Right now!

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: Martha, come on!  
(It is raining, and Martha is making another telephone call.)  
MARTHA: Leo! Oh, thank God. Leo, you got to listen to me. Where are you?

**[Sea front]**

(Leo is with his girlfriend, who is pushing a pram.)  
LEO: I'm in Brighton. Yeah, we came down with Boxer. Did you see that Saxon
thing on telly?  
MARTHA [OC]: Leo, just listen to me. Don't go home.

**[Underpass]**

MARTHA: I'm telling you. Don't phone Mum or Dad or Tish.

**[Sea front]**

MARTHA [OC]: You've got to hide.  
LEO: Shut up.  
MARTHA [OC]: On my life.

**[Underpass]**

MARTHA: You've got to trust me.

**[Cabinet room]**

MARTHA [OC]: Go to Boxer's. Stay with him. Don't tell anyone. Just hide.  
MASTER: Ooo, a nice little game of

**[Underpass]**

MASTER [OC]: Hide and seek. I love that. But I'll find you, Martha Jones.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: Been a long time since we saw each other. Must be, what, one hundred
trillion years?

**[Underpass]**

MARTHA: Let them go, Saxon. Do you hear me! Let them go!  
(The Doctor takes her phone.)  
DOCTOR: I'm here.

**[Cabinet room]**

(The Master transfers the call to his mobile.)  
MASTER: Doctor.

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: Master.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: I like it when you use my name.

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: You chose it. Psychiatrist's field day.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: As you chose yours. The man who makes people better. How sanctimonious
is that?

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: So, Prime Minister, then.  
MASTER: I know.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: It's good, isn't it?

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: Who are those creatures? Because there's no such thing as the
Toclafane. It's just a made up name, like the Bogeyman.  
MASTER [OC]: Do you remember

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: All those fairy tales about the Toclafane when we were kids

**[Underpass]**

MASTER [OC]: Back home. Where is it, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Gone.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: How can Gallifrey be gone?

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: It burnt.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: And the Time Lords?

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: Dead. And the Daleks, more or less. What happened to you?

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: The Time Lords only resurrected me because they knew I'd be the
perfect warrior for a

**[Underpass]**

MASTER [OC]: Time War. I was there when the

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: Dalek Emperor took control of the Cruciform. I saw it. I ran. I ran so
far. Made myself human so they would never find me, because I was so scared.

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: I know.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: All of them? But not you, which must mean

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: I was the only one who could end it. And I tried. I did. I tried
everything.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: What did it feel like, though? Two almighty civilisations burning. Oh,
tell me, how did that feel?

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: Stop it!  
MASTER [OC]: You must have been like God.  
DOCTOR: I've been alone ever since. But not anymore. Don't you see? All we've
got is each other.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: Are you asking me out on a date?

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: You could stop this right now. We could leave this planet. We can
fight across the constellations, if that's what you want, but not on Earth.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: Too late.

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: Why do you say that?

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: The drumming. Can't you hear it? I thought it would stop, but it never
does. Never ever stops. Inside my head, the drumming, Doctor. The constant
drumming.

**[Underpass]**

DOCTOR: I could help you. Please, let me help.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: It's everywhere. Listen, listen, listen. Here come the drums. Here
come the drums.

**[Shopping centre]**

(A man lounging nearby starts slapping his thighs in the rhythm.)  
DOCTOR: What have you done? Tell me how you've done this. What are those
creatures? Tell me!

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: Ooo look. You're on TV.

**[Shopping centre]**

DOCTOR: Stop it. Answer me.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: No, really. You're on telly. You and your little band, which,

**[Shopping centre]**

(The broadcast is on a TV in a shop window.)  
MASTER [OC]: By the way, is ticking every demographic box. So, congratulations
on that. Look, there you are.  
(The ticker says Nationwide Hunt For Terrorist Suspects, and has their
pictures.)  
NEWS 24: Known as the Captain. They are known to be armed and extremely
dangerous.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: You're public enemies number one, two and three. Oh, and you can tell
handsome Jack that I've sent his little gang

**[Shopping centre]**

MASTER [OC]: Off on a wild goose chase to the Himalayas, so he won't be
getting any help from them.

**[Cabinet room]**

(The Master switches the laptop to the CCTV feed of the shopping precinct.)  
MASTER: Now, go on, off you go. Why not start by turning to the right?

**[Shopping centre]**

DOCTOR: He can see us.  
(The Doctor zaps the CCTV with the sonic screwdriver.)

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: Oh, you public menace. Better start running. Go on, run.

**[Shopping centre]**

DOCTOR: He's got control of everything.  
MARTHA: What do we do?  
JACK: We've got nowhere to go.  
MARTHA: Doctor, what do we do?  
MASTER [OC]: Run, Doctor.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: Run for your life!

**[Shopping centre]**

DOCTOR: We run.

**[Cabinet room]**

MASTER: I said, run!  
(Later, he is going through various TV channels on his laptop, whilst sipping
a glass of whiskey.)  
NEWS 24: Tomorrow morning, Britain will be welcoming an extraterrestrial
species  
AMNN: The President is said to be furious that Great Britain has taken
unilateral action.  
(Chinese television news, then the Telletubbies. A Toclafane appears.)  
MASTER: Have you seen these things? This planet's amazing. Television in their
stomach. Now that is evolution.  
(The Doctor prefers the Clangers, I believe.)  
FEMALE SPHERE: Is the machine ready?  
MASTER: Tomorrow morning. It reaches critical at eight oh two precisely.  
FEMALE SPHERE: We have to escape, because it's coming, sir. The darkness, the
never ending darkness. The terrible, terrible cold. We have to run and run and
run!  
MASTER: Eight o'clock tomorrow morning. Tell your people the world is waiting.  
(The sphere disappears. The Master looks out of the window at the pouring
rain.)

**[Warehouse]**

(Martha returns with a bag of takeaway food.)  
JACK: How was it?  
MARTHA: I don't think anyone saw me. Anything new?  
JACK: I've got this tuned to government wavelengths so we can follow what
Saxon's doing.  
MARTHA: Yeah, I meant about my family.  
DOCTOR: It still says the Jones family taken in for questioning. Tell you
what, though. No mention of Leo.  
MARTHA: He's not as daft as he looks. I'm talking about my brother on the run.
How did this happen?  
JACK: Nice chips.  
DOCTOR: Actually, they're not bad.  
JACK: So, Doctor, who is he? How come the ancient society of Time Lords
created a psychopath?  
MARTHA: And what is he to you? Like a colleague or  
DOCTOR: A friend, at first.  
MARTHA: I thought you were going to say he was your secret brother or
something.  
DOCTOR: You've been watching too much TV.  
JACK: But all the legends of Gallifrey made it sound so perfect.  
DOCTOR: Well, perfect to look at, maybe. And it was. It was beautiful. They
used to call it the Shining World of the Seven Systems. And on the Continent
of Wild Endeavour, in the Mountains of Solace and Solitude, there stood the
Citadel of the Time Lords, the oldest and most mighty race in the universe,
looking down on the galaxies below. Sworn never to interfere, only to watch.
Children of Gallifrey, taken from their families age of eight to enter the
Academy. And some say that's when it all began. When he was a child. That's
when the Master saw eternity. As a novice, he was taken for initiation. He
stood in front of the Untempered Schism. It's a gap in the fabric of reality
through which could be seen the whole of the vortex. You stand there, eight
years old, staring at the raw power of time and space, just a child. Some
would be inspired, some would run away, and some would go mad. Brr. I don't
know.  
MARTHA: What about you?  
DOCTOR: Oh, the ones that ran away, I never stopped.  
(Jack's bracelet beeps.)  
JACK: Encrypted channel with files attached. Don't recognise it.  
DOCTOR: Patch it through to the laptop.  
JACK: Since we're telling stories, there's something I haven't told you.  
(The Torchwood logo appears on the laptop with the miraculous battery life.)  
DOCTOR: You work for Torchwood.  
JACK: I swear to you, it's different. It's changed. There's only half a dozen
of us now.  
DOCTOR: Everything Torchwood did, and you're part of it?  
JACK: The old regime was destroyed at Canary Wharf. I rebuilt it, I changed
it, and when I did that, I did it for you in your honour.  
(The Doctor hits play.)  
VIVIEN [on screen]: If I haven't returned to my desk by twenty two hundred,
this file will be emailed to Torchwood. Which means if you're watching this,
then I'm. Anyway, the Saxon files are attached. But take a look at the
Archangel document. That's when it all started. When Harry Saxon became
Minister in charge of launching the Archangel Network.  
DOCTOR: What's the Archangel Network?  
MARTHA: I've got Archangel. Everyone's got it.  
JACK: It's a mobile phone network. Because look, it's gone worldwide. They've
got fifteen satellites in orbit. Even the other networks, they're all carried
by Archangel.  
DOCTOR: It's in the phones! Oh, I said he was a hypnotist. Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.  
(The Doctor taps Martha's phone against the table, and it starts beeping di di
di dum di di di dum.)  
DOCTOR: There it is. That rhythm, it's everywhere, ticking away in the
subconscious.  
MARTHA: What is it, mind control?  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. It's subtler than that. Any stronger and people
would question it. But contained in that rhythm, in layers of code, Vote
Saxon. Believe in me. Whispering to the world. Oh, yes! That's how he hid
himself from me, because I should have sensed there was another Time Lord on
Earth. I should have known way back. The signal cancelled him out.  
JACK: Any way you can stop it?  
DOCTOR: Not from down here. But now we know how he's doing it.  
MARTHA: And we can fight back.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes!  
(The Doctor takes parts of the phone and the laptop, and welds them sonically
to their Tardis keys.)  
DOCTOR: Three Tardis keys. Three pieces of the Tardis, all with low level
perception properties because the Tardis is designed to blend in. Well, sort
of. But now, the Archangel Network's got a second low level signal. Weld the
key to the network and Martha, look at me. You can see me, yes?  
MARTHA: Yes.  
DOCTOR: What about now?  
(He puts the string with his key on it around his neck, and Martha finds it
difficult to look straight at him.)  
DOCTOR: No, I'm here. Look at me.  
MARTHA: It's like I know you're there, but I don't want to know.  
DOCTOR: And back again. See? It just shifts your perception a tiny little bit.
Doesn't make us invisible, just unnoticed. Oh, I know what it's like. It's
like, it's like when you fancy someone and they don't even know you exist.
That's what it's like. Come on.  
JACK: You too, huh?

**[Pathway]**

DOCTOR: Don't run, don't shout. Just keep your voice down. Draw attention to
yourself and the spell is broken. Just keep to the shadows.  
JACK: Like ghosts.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's what we are. Ghosts.  
(With the keys around their necks, they have to step aside to prevent people
from walking into them.)  
NEWS 24: And as they eyes of the world turn towards Great Britain, sources
indicate that Air Force One has landed on British soil tonight.

**[Airport]**

(The Master salutes as the President walks up to him. He's a George W Bush
look-alike.)  
MASTER: Mister President, sir.  
WINTERS: Mister Saxon, the British Army will stand down. From now on, UNIT has
control of this operation.  
MASTER: You make it sound like an invasion.  
WINTERS: First Contact policy was decided by the Security Council in 1968, and
you've just gone and ignored it.  
MASTER: Well, you know what it's like. New job, all that paperwork. I think
it's down the back of the settee. I did have a quick look. I found a pen, a
sweet, a bus ticket and er, have you met the wife?  
WINTERS: Mister Saxon, I'm not sure what your game is but there are provisions
at the United Nations to have you removed from office unless you are very,
very careful. Is that understood? Are you taking this seriously? To business.
We've accessed your files on these Toclafane.  
(The Doctor, Jack and Martha are watching a little way away.)  
WINTERS: First Contact cannot take place on any sovereign soil. To that
purpose, the aircraft carrier Valiant is en route. The rendezvous will take
place there at eight am. You're trying my patience, sir.  
MASTER: So America is completely in charge?  
WINTERS: Since Britain elected an ass, yes. I'll see you onboard the Valiant.  
MASTER: It still will be televised, though, won't it. Because I promised, and
the whole world is watching.  
WINTERS: Since it's too late to pull out, the world will be watching. Me.  
(The President walks to his motorcade.)  
MASTER: The last President of America. We have a private plane ready and
waiting. We should reach the Valiant within the hour. My darling.  
(Lucy leaves with her security guard. The Master turns and looks in the rough
direction of our trio. A Police van arrives and the Master runs over to it.
Clive and Francine are bundled out.)  
MASTER: Ha ha ha! Hi, guys!  
CLIVE: You can't just do this.  
MASTER: All will be revealed.  
MARTHA: Oh my God.  
DOCTOR: Don't move.  
MARTHA: But the  
DOCTOR: Don't.  
(Clive and Francine are pushed into a Range Rover Vogue.)  
MARTHA: I'm going to kill him.  
JACK: What say I use this perception filter to walk up behind him and break
his neck?  
DOCTOR: Now that sounds like Torchwood.  
JACK: Still a good plan.  
DOCTOR: He's a Time Lord, which makes him my responsibility. I'm not here to
kill him. I'm here to save him.  
JACK: Aircraft carrier Valiant. It's a UNIT ship at fifty eight point two
north, ten point oh two east.  
MARTHA: How do we get on board?  
DOCTOR: Does that thing work as a teleport?  
JACK: Since you revamped it, yeah. Coordinates set.  
(All hands on Jack's bracelet.)

**[Engine room]**

MARTHA: Oh, that thing is rough.  
JACK: I've has worse nights. Welcome to the Valiant.  
MARTHA: It's dawn? Hold on, I thought this was a ship. Where's the sea?  
JACK: A ship for the twenty first century, protecting the skies of planet
Earth.  
(Valiant is effectively a Cloudbase, with three landing strips and a helipad.
See Gerry Anderson's 'Captain Scarlet' for more details.)

**[Flight deck]**

TANNOY: Europe now online. Awaiting confirmation from South America. And keep
tracking Japan.  
(Lucy and the Master arrive in the lift. The actual ship's bridge is on a
raised area at the far end of the large area. Cameras are stationed at the
side and there is a big glass conference table and chairs in the middle. One
of the pieces of equipment on the bridge is a large circular item with
engraving like the fob watch.)  
WINTERS: I want the whole thing branded in my suit of office, not the UN. You
got that?  
WOMAN: This material is being transmitted prior to transmission.  
MASTER: Anything I can do? I could make the tea, or isn't that American
enough? I don't know, I could make grits. What are grits, anyway?  
WINTERS: It you could just sit.  
(The Master and Lucy walk away.)  
MASTER: Misery guts. What do you think? It's good, isn't it?  
LUCY: It's beautiful.  
MASTER: Some of my best work. Ministry of Defence. I helped design this place.
Every detail.

**[Valiant]**

(The Doctor stops running.)  
JACK: We've no time for sightseeing.  
DOCTOR: No, wait. Shush, shush, shush, shush. Can't you hear it?  
JACK: Hear what?  
MARTHA: Doctor, my family's on board.  
DOCTOR: Brilliant. This way.  
(They run down a gangway to level 4, then open a door at the end.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, at last!  
MARTHA: Oh, yes!  
JACK: What's it doing on the Valiant?

**[Tardis]**

JACK: What the hell's he done?  
DOCTOR: Don't touch it.  
JACK: I'm not going to.  
MARTHA: What's he done though? Sounds like it's sick.  
DOCTOR: It can't be. No, no, no, no, no, no, it can't be.  
MARTHA: Doctor, what is it?  
DOCTOR: He's cannibalised the Tardis.  
JACK: Is this what I think it is?  
DOCTOR: It's a paradox machine.

**[Flight deck]**

WINTERS: Two minutes, everyone.  
(Winters heads up the steps.)  
WINTERS: According to the treaty, all armed personnel are requested to leave
the flight deck immediately. Thank you.  
TANNOY: Five, four, three, two, one.  
MASTER: Jelly baby?  
WINTERS: Broadcasting at seven fifty eight with the arrival timed for eight
hundred hours exactly. And, er, good luck to all of us.

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor taps a gauge on the metal mesh around the time console.)  
DOCTOR: As soon as this hits red, it activates. At this speed, it'll trigger
at two minutes past eight.  
JACK: First contact is at eight, then two minutes later  
MARTHA: What's it for? What does a paradox machine do?  
JACK: More important, can you stop it?  
DOCTOR: Not till I know what it's doing. Touch the wrong bit, blow up the
solar system.  
MARTHA: Then we've got to get to the Master.  
JACK: Yeah. How are we going to stop him?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I've got a way. Sorry, didn't I mention it?

**[Various locations]**

(The television is on whilst school children have breakfast in the canteen,
workers are in a cafe, mothers are feeding their children, etc etc.)  
NEWS 24: And in just thirty seconds' time, we'll be going live to First
Contact. It's been announced that Harold Saxon has invited President Winters
to take the address.  
AMNN: It's three am in the morning on the eastern seaboard and President
Winters has been chosen to lead the world into a new age.

**[Flight deck]**

WINTERS: My fellow Americans, patriots, people of the world. I stand before
you today as ambassador for humanity, a role I will undertake with the utmost
solemnity. Perhaps our Toclafane cousins can offer us much, but what is
important is not that we gain material benefits, but that we learn to see
ourselves anew.  
(The Doctor, Martha and Jack enter quietly.)  
WINTERS: For as long as man has looked at the stars, he has wondered what
mysteries they hold. Now we know we are not alone.  
JACK: (sotto) This plan, you going to tell us?  
WINTERS: No longer unique in the universe.  
DOCTOR: If I can get this around the Master's neck, cancel out his perception,
they'll see him for real. It's just hard to go unnoticed with everyone on red
alert. If they stop me you've got a key.  
JACK: Yes, sir.  
MARTHA: I'll get him.  
WINTERS: And I ask you now, I ask of the human race, to join with me in
welcoming our friends. I give you the Toclafane.  
(The four spheres appear.)  
WINTERS: My name is Arthur Coleman Winters, President Elect of the United
States of America, and designated representative of the United Nations. I
welcome you to the planet Earth and its associated moon.  
MALE SPHERE: You're not the Master.  
FEMALE SPHERE: We like the Mister Master.  
MALE SPHERE 2: We don't like you.  
WINTERS: I can be master, if you so wish. I will accept mastery over you, if
that is God's will.  
MALE SPHERE 2: Man is stupid.  
MALE SPHERE: Master is our friend.  
FEMALE SPHERE Where's my Master, pretty please?  
MASTER: Oh, all right then. It's me. Ta da! Sorry, sorry, I have this effect.
People just get obsessed. Is it the smile? Is it the aftershave? Is it the
capacity to laugh at myself? I don't know. It's crazy.  
WINTERS: Saxon, what are you talking about?  
MASTER: I'm taking control, Uncle Sam, starting with you. Kill him.  
(A sphere points its weapon at Winters and blasts him into little pieces.
General consternation and guns drawn. The Master laughs and applauds.)  
MASTER: Guards.  
GUARD: Nobody move! Nobody move!  
MASTER: Now then, peoples of the Earth. Please attend carefully.  
(The Doctor takes off his key and tries to run forward. Two men in black grab
him.)  
GUARD: Stop him!  
MASTER: We meet at last, Doctor. Oh, ho. I love saying that.  
DOCTOR: Stop it! Stop it now!  
MASTER: As if a perception filter's going to work on me. And look, it's the
girlie and the freak. Although, I'm not sure which one's which.  
(Jack runs forward. The Master zaps him with his screwdriver.)  
MASTER: Laser screwdriver. Who'd have sonic? And the good thing is, he's not
dead for long. I get to kill him again!  
DOCTOR: Master, just calm down. Just look at what you're doing. Just stop. If
you could see yourself  
MASTER: Oh, do excuse me. Little bit of personal business. Back in a minute.
Let him go.  
DOCTOR: It's that sound. The sound in your head. What if I could help?  
MASTER: Oh, how to shut him up? I know. Memory Lane. Professor Lazarus.
Remember him and his genetic manipulation device? What, did you think that
little Tish got that job merely by coincidence? I've been laying traps for you
all this time. And if I can concentrate all that Lazarus technology into one
little screwdriver? But, ooo, if I only had the Doctor's biological code. Oh,
wait a minute, I do.  
(He opens a large metal briefcase.)  
MASTER: I've got his hand. And if Lazarus made himself younger, what if I
reverse it? Another hundred years?  
(The Master aims his screwdriver at the Doctor, who goes into rapid
convulsions. Jack revives with Martha next to him.)  
JACK: Teleport.  
MARTHA: I can't.  
JACK: We can't stop him. Get out of here. Get out.  
(Lucy is looking very unhappy with all this. The Master stops zapping the
Doctor, who now looks at least a hundred years old.)  
MARTHA: Doctor? I've got you.  
MASTER: Ah, she's a would be doctor. But tonight, Martha Jones, we've flown
them in all the way from prison.  
(Clive, Tish and Francine are brought in, their wrists fastened together with
cable ties.)  
GUARD: Come on, move.  
MARTHA: Mum.  
FRANCINE: I'm sorry.  
DOCTOR: The Toclafane. What are they? Who are they?  
MASTER: Doctor, if I told you the truth, your hearts would break.  
MALE SPHERE: Is it time? Is it ready?  
FEMALE SPHERE: Is the machine singing?  
MASTER: Two minutes past. So, Earthings. Basically, er, end of the world. Here
come the drums!  
(Rogue Trader's song 'Voodoo Child' starts playing as the paradox machine in
the Tardis activates.)  
SINGER: Here come the drums. Here come the drums. Baby, baby, baby. You are my
voodoo child, my voodoo child. Don't say maybe, maybe.  
(A tear appears in the sky above the Valiant and thousands of spheres pour
out.)  
SINGER: It's supernatural. I'm coming undone. Baby, baby, baby. You are my
voodoo child, my voodoo child. Don't say maybe, maybe. It's supernatural. I'm
coming undone. Baby, baby, baby. You are my voodoo child, my voodoo child.  
MASTER: How many do you think?  
LUCY: I, I don't know.  
MASTER: Six billion. Down you go, kids!  
(The spheres head to the population centres and open fire.)  
MASTER: Shall we decimate them? That sounds good. A nice word, decimate.
Remove one tenth of the population!  
(The Doctor whispers to Martha, although we don't actually see that in this
episode. She moves away from him, holding Jack's bracelet.)  
GENEVA [OC]: Valiant, this is Geneva. We're getting slaughtered down here.
Valiant, report. Help us. For God's sake, help us! They're everywhere!  
(Other reports come in in other languages.)  
LONDON [OC]: This is London, Valiant. This is London calling. What do we do?
They're killing us! The Toclafane are all around. They're killing us. (Martha
teleports away. The Doctor and Jack look at each other, and the Doctor nods.)

**[Hampstead Heath]**

(Still wearing the Tardis key, Martha watches London burning.)  
MARTHA: I'm coming back.

**[Flight deck]**

(The Master and Lucy hold up the ancient Doctor so he can watch the
slaughter.)  
MASTER: And so it came to pass that the human race fell, and the Earth was no
more. And I looked down upon my new dominion as Master of all, and I thought
it good.
