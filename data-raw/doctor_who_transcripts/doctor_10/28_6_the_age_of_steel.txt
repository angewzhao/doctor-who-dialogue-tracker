**The Age of Steel**  
  
Original Airdate: 20 May, 2006  

**[Outside the Tyler's house]**

(Carrying on from the end of the last episode - because I can't be bothered to
type up the whole recap section - the Doctor points the recharging Tardis
power cell at the Cybermen, who get bent backwards then atomised by the golden
energy.)  
RICKY: What the hell was that?  
DOCTOR: We'll have that instead. Run!  
(Mrs Moore sounds the van's horn.)  
MOORE: Everybody, in!  
PETE: I've got to go back. My wife's in there.  
DOCTOR: Anyone inside that house is dead. If you want to help, then don't let
her die for nothing. You've got to come with us right now.  
MOORE: Come on! Get a move on!  
DOCTOR: Rose, she's not your mother.  
ROSE: I know.  
DOCTOR: Come on.  
MOORE: Finished chatting? Never seen a slower getaway in my life!  
(They drive off. More legions of Cybermen are on the move.  
Inside, Jackie peers round of the cellar door to see Cybermen nearby.)

**[Van]**

RICKY: What was that thing?  
DOCTOR: Little bit of technology from my home.  
MICKEY: It's stopped glowing. Has it run out?  
DOCTOR: It's on a revitalising loop. It'll charge back up in about four hours.  
RICKY: Right. So, we don't have a weapon anymore.  
JAKE: Yeah, we've got weapons. Might not be one of those metal things, but
they're good enough for men like him.  
ROSE: Leave him alone. What's he done wrong?  
JAKE: Oh, you know, just laid a trap that's wiped out the Government and left
Lumic in charge.  
PETE: If I was part of all that, do you think I'd leave my wife inside?  
RICKY: Maybe your plan went wrong. Still gives us the right to execute you,
though.  
DOCTOR: Talk about executions, you'll make me your enemy. And take some really
good advice. You don't want to do that.  
RICKY: All the same, we have evidence that says Pete Tyler's been working for
Lumic since twenty point five.  
ROSE: Is that true?  
RICKY: Tell them, Mrs M.  
MOORE: We've got a government mole who feeds us information. Lumic's private
files, his South American operations, the lot. Secret broadcasts twice a week.  
PETE: Broadcast from Gemini?  
RICKY: And how do you know that?  
PETE: I'm Gemini. That's me.  
RICKY: Yeah, well you would say that.  
PETE: Encrypted wavelength six five seven using binary nine. That's the only
reason I was working for Lumic. To get information. I thought I was
broadcasting to the Security Services. What do I get? Scooby Doo and his gang.
They've even got the van.  
MICKEY: No, no, no. But the Preachers know what they're doing. Ricky said he's
London's Most Wanted.  
RICKY: Yeah, that's not exactly  
MICKEY: Not exactly what?  
RICKY: I'm London's Most Wanted for parking tickets.  
PETE: Great.  
RICKY: Yeah, they were deliberate. I was fighting the system. Park anywhere,
that's me.  
DOCTOR: Good policy. I do much the same. I'm the Doctor, by the way, if
anyone's interested.  
ROSE: And I'm Rose. Hello.  
PETE: Even better. That's the name of my dog. Still, at least I've got the
catering staff on my side.  
ROSE: I knew you weren't a traitor.  
PETE: Why is that, then?  
ROSE: I just did.  
PETE: They took my wife.  
ROSE: She might still be alive.  
PETE: That's even worse. Because that's what Lumic does. He takes the living
and he turns them into those machines.  
DOCTOR: Cybermen. They're called Cybermen. And I'd take those ear pods off, if
I were you. You never know. Lumic could be listening.  
(The Doctor zaps the ear pods with his sonic screwdriver.)  
DOCTOR: But he's overreached himself. He's still just a businessman. He's
assassinated the President. All we need to do is get to the city and inform
the authorities. Because I promise you, this ends tonight.

**[Control room]**

LUMIC: My everlasting children. Tell me, how does it feel?  
CYBERMAN: We feel nothing.  
LUMIC: But in your mind, what do you think?  
CYBERMAN: We think the same. We are uniform.  
LUMIC: But you think of what?  
CYBERMAN: We think of the humans. We think of their difference and their pain.
They suffer in the skin. They must be upgraded.  
LUMIC: Excellent. Then let's begin. Computer, identify John Lumic.  
COMPUTER: Voice print acknowledged.  
LUMIC: Activate ear pod primary sequence.  
COMPUTER: Please state area of activation.  
LUMIC: The City of London. I've just declared Independence. Begin
transmission.  
(In a pedestrianised area, a Cybus download signal sounds and everyone stops
moving. Jackie receives it too in the cellar. She walks past the Cyberman and
out of the cellar.)  
LUMIC: You will come to me, my dear children. The Immortal Ones.  
REPORTER [on TV]: All of London has been sealed off. There are reports of an
army. An army of metal men. All citizens should remove their ear pods. I
repeat, remove all ear pods. London has been placed under martial law. If
you're hearing this, stay in your homes. I repeat, stay in your homes.

**[Outside Battersea Power station]**

(Crane rips off his ear pods just as the broadcast hits them.)  
CRANE: Oh no, you don't.

**[Street]**

JAKE: What the hell?  
ROSE: What's going on?  
(The people are walking like zombies.)  
DOCTOR: It's the ear-pods. Lumic's taken control.  
ROSE: Can't we just, I don't know, take them off?  
DOCTOR: Don't! Cause a brainstorm. Human race. For such an intelligent lot,
you aren't half susceptible. Give anyone a chance to take control and you
submit. Sometimes I think you like it. Easy life.  
JAKE: Hey, Come and see.  
(Around the corner are more people, and a squad of Cybermen.)  
ROSE: Where are they all going?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. Lumic must have a base of operations.  
PETE: Battersea. That's where he was building his prototypes.  
ROSE: Why's he doing it?  
PETE: He's dying. This all started out as a way of prolonging life, of keeping
the brain alive at any cost.  
ROSE: The thing is, I've seen Cybermen before, haven't I? The head. Those
handle shapes in Van Statten's museum.  
DOCTOR: Ah, there are Cybermen in our universe. They started on an ordinary
world just like this, then swarmed across the galaxy. This lot are a parallel
version, and they're starting from scratch right here on Earth.  
PETE: What the hell are you two on about?  
RICKY: Never mind that. Come on, we need to get out of the city. Okay, split
up. Mrs Moore, you look after that bloke. Jake, distract them. Go right, I'll
go left. We'll meet back at Bridge Street. Move.  
MICKEY: I'm going with him.  
(Mickey kisses Rose and follows Ricky.)  
MOORE: Come on, let's go.  
(More Cybermen patrols.)  
DOCTOR: There!  
(They run down a side street.)

**[Industrial unit]**

MICKEY: Which way? I don't know where we are.  
RICKY: Did they see us?  
MICKEY: Do they know where we are?  
RICKY: I think they saw us. I bet they can see in the dark  
MICKEY: I bet they've got satellites  
RICKY: I bet they saw us in the dark.  
MICKEY + RICKY: They know where we are.  
RICKY: I don't get it. What is it with you? You are exactly like me.  
MICKEY: I don't know, I reckon you're braver.  
RICKY: Oh yeah, ten times. Still, your friends aren't bad. I'll give you that.  
MICKEY: Oh, that's the Doctor and Rose. I just tag along behind.  
RICKY: Well, then, you're not that bad.  
MICKEY: Do you think?  
RICKY: Yeah, I suppose.  
(Clomp, clomp.)  
MICKEY: Cybermen.  
MICKEY + RICKEY: Split up!

**[Alley]**

(A group of Cybermen march down an alley near where Mrs Moore, Pete, Rose and
the Doctor are hiding behind rubbish bins. Rose grabs Pete's hand. The Doctor
uses his sonic screwdriver to transmit a signal, and the Cybermen march on.)  
DOCTOR: Go.

**[Outside Battersea Power Station]**

(Jackie is amongst the stream of zombies.)  
CYBERMAN [OC]: Chamber twelve now closed for sterilisation. All reject stock
will be incinerated.

**[Industrial unit]**

(Ricky and Mickey end up on opposite sides of a tall chain-link fence. The
Cybermen are behind Ricky.)  
MICKEY: Come on! Come on! Come on!  
(Ricky starts to climb the fence. A Cyberman grabs his ankle and electrocutes
him.)  
MICKEY: No!  
(Mickey and the Cybermen stare at each other in silence, then Mickey runs.)

**[Control room]**

(Crane is escorted in.)  
CYBERMAN: This one is unprogrammed.  
LUMIC: Mister Crane, I thought you were one of the faithful.  
CRANE: Oh, that I am, sir. My ear pod must've malfunctioned. For which I
apologise. If I, er, might? I'd like to request an upgrade, sir. I've seen the
future, and it's copyright Cybus Industries. Sign me up.  
LUMIC: A willing volunteer.  
CRANE: You've known me a long time, sir. Quite a team, you and me. I've been
with you all the way. But believe me, sir, knowing you so well, I know exactly
what to do.  
(Crane grabs Lumic's oxygen line then starts wrecking the life support system
at the back of his wheelchair.)  
LUMIC: No! Help me!  
(A Cybermen casually tosses Crane across the room.)  
CRANE: Die, you  
(The Cyberman electrocutes Crane.)  
LUMIC: Help me!  
CYBERMAN: You are in pain. We can remove pain forever.  
LUMIC: No, not yet! I'm not ready.  
CYBERMAN: We will give you immortality.  
LUMIC: I've told you. I will upgrade only with my last breath!  
CYBERMAN: Then breathe no more.  
(The Cyberman takes remote control of the wheelchair.)  
LUMIC: No! No! I command you, no!

**[Street]**

JAKE: I ran past the river. You should have seen it. The whole city's on the
march. Hundreds of Cybermen all down the Thames.  
(Mickey runs up.)  
JAKE: Here he is! Which one are you?  
MICKEY: I'm sorry. The Cybermen. He couldn't.  
JAKE: Are you Ricky? Are you Ricky?  
ROSE: Mickey, that's you, isn't it?  
MICKEY: Yeah.  
(Rose hugs Mickey.)  
MICKEY: He tried. He was running. There was too many of them.  
JAKE: Shut it.  
MICKEY: There was nothing I could do.  
JAKE: I said just shut it. Don't even talk about him. You're nothing, you are.
Nothing.  
DOCTOR: We can mourn him when London is safe. But now, we move on.

**[Waste ground]**

(Opposite Battersea Power Station.)  
DOCTOR: The whole of London's been sealed off, and the entire population's
been taken inside that place. To be converted.  
ROSE: We've got to get in there and shut it down.  
MICKEY: How do we do that?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'll think of something.  
MICKEY: You're just making this up as you go along.  
DOCTOR: Yep. But I do it brilliantly.  
(Later, Mrs Moore has joined them and is using her Cybus Industries laptop.)  
MOORE: That's a schematic of the old factory. Look. Cooling tunnels underneath
the plant. Big enough to walk through  
DOCTOR: We go under there and up into the control centre?  
MOORE: Mmm.  
PETE: There's another way in. Through the front door. If they've taken Jackie
for upgrading, that's how she'll get in.  
JAKE: We can't just go strolling up.  
MOORE: Or we could, with these. Fake ear pods. Dead. No signal. But put them
on, the Cybermen would mistake you for one of the crowd.  
PETE: Then that's my job.  
DOCTOR: You'd have to show no emotion. None at all. Any sign of emotion would
give you away.  
ROSE: How many of those you got?  
MOORE: Just two sets.  
ROSE: Okay. If that's the best way of finding Jackie, then I'm coming with
you.  
PETE: Why does she matter to you?  
ROSE: We haven't got time. Doctor, I'm going with him, and that's that.  
DOCTOR: No stopping you, is there?  
ROSE: No.  
DOCTOR: Tell you what. We can take the ear pods at the same time. Give people
their minds back so they don't walk into that place like sheep. Jakey-boy?
Lumic's transmitting the control signal. It must be from over there.  
(He waves his sonic screwdriver in the direction of the power station. The
Zeppelin is parked on top, with a circle of red lights blinking on its bow, or
stern.)  
DOCTOR: There it is. On the zeppelin, you see? Great big transmitter. Good
thing Lumic likes showing off. Reckon you could take it out?  
JAKE: Consider it done.  
DOCTOR: Mrs Moore, would you care to accompany me into the cooling tunnels?  
MOORE: How could I refuse an offer of cooling tunnels?  
DOCTOR: We attack on three sides. Above, between, below. We get to the control
centre, we stop the conversion machines.  
MICKEY: What about me?  
DOCTOR: Mickey. You can er  
MICKEY: What, stay out of trouble? Be the tin dog? No, those days are over.
I'm going with Jake.  
JAKE: I don't need you, idiot.  
MICKEY: I'm not an idiot! You got that? I'm offering to help.  
JAKE: Whatever.  
DOCTOR: Mickey. Good luck.  
MICKEY: Yeah, you too. Rose, I'll see you later.  
ROSE: Yeah, you'd better.  
DOCTOR: If we survive this, I'll see you back at the Tardis.  
MICKEY: That's a promise.  
(Mickey walks off, then turns to see the Doctor hug Rose.)  
DOCTOR: Good luck.

**[Cooling tunnels]**

MOORE: It's freezing.  
DOCTOR: Any sign of a light switch?  
MOORE: Can't see a thing. But I've got these. A device for every occasion.  
DOCTOR: Ooo!  
MOORE: Put it on.  
(A torch on a headband.)  
DOCTOR: Haven't got a hotdog in there, have you? I'm starving.  
MOORE: Of all the things to wish for. That's mechanically recovered meat.  
DOCTOR: I know. It's the Cyberman of food, but it's tasty.  
MOORE: A proper torch as well.  
DOCTOR: Let's see where we are.  
(There are Cybermen ranged along both sides of the tunnel.)  
DOCTOR: Already converted, just put on ice. Come on.  
(He taps on one Cyberman's face. No reaction.)  
DOCTOR: Let's go slowly. Keep an eye out for trip systems.

**[Outside Battersea Power Station]**

(More people are being escorted in.)  
CYBERMAN [OC]: Chamber six now open for human upgrading. Chamber seven now
open for human upgrading.  
(Pete and Rose keep out of sight.)  
CYBERMAN [OC]: Chamber eight now open for human upgrading.  
PETE: Just put them on. Don't show any emotion. No signs, nothing. Okay?  
ROSE: Don't worry. We can do it.  
CYBERMAN [OC]: Chamber seven now open for human upgrading.  
(They put the ear pods on.)  
PETE: We could die in here. Why are you doing this?  
ROSE: Let's just say I'm doing it for my mum and dad. Right, let's go.  
CYBERMAN [OC]: Chamber eight now open for human upgrading.  
(Holding hands, Pete and Rose join the procession.)  
CYBERMAN [OC]: Chamber nine now open for human upgrading. Chamber ten now open
for human upgrading. Chamber eleven now open for human upgrading.

**[Power station roof]**

(Jake is first up the ladder to the roof.)  
JAKE: Two guards. We can take them.  
MICKEY: Don't kill them.  
JAKE: Who put you in charge?  
MICKEY: If you kill them, what's the difference between you and the Cybermen?  
JAKE: Well, I suppose we could use these.  
MICKEY: Smelling salts?  
JAKE: Bit stronger than that. One of Mrs Moore's little tricks. Should knock
them out. Three, two, one.  
(They run out from their cover and behind the two human guards. They put the
little bottles under their noses and the men collapse from the vapour.)  
MICKEY: There's got to be more guards on board.  
JAKE: Then let's go get them.

**[Cooling tunnel]**

DOCTOR: How did you get into this, then, rattling along with the Preachers?  
MOORE: Oh, I used to be ordinary. Worked at Cybus Industries, nine to five,
till one day, I find something I'm not supposed to. A file on the mainframe.
All I did was read it. Then suddenly I've got men with guns knocking in the
middle of the night. Life on the run. Then I found the Preachers. They needed
a techie, so I, I just sat down and taught myself everything.  
DOCTOR: What about Mr Moore?  
MOORE: Well, he's not called Moore. I got that from a book, Mrs Moore. It's
safer not to use real names. But he thinks I'm dead. It was the only way to
keep him safe. Him and the kids. What about you? Got any family, or?  
DOCTOR: Oh, who needs family? I've got the whole world on my shoulders. Go on,
then. What's your real name?  
MOORE: Angela Price. Don't tell a soul.  
DOCTOR: Not a word.  
(Behind them, a Cyberman is activated. It sends an alarm signal.)

**[Control room]**

CYBERMAN 2: Movement in Deepcold Six.  
CYBERMAN: Awaken the army.

**[Cooling tunnel]**

MOORE: Doctor, did that one just move?  
DOCTOR: It's just the torchlight. Keep going, come on.  
(A Cyberman moves near them.)  
DOCTOR: They're waking up. Run!  
(They run along the row, who fall in behind them and start clomping along.
They get to a ladder at the end of the tunnel.)  
MOORE: Get up! Quick! They're coming! Open it! Open it!  
(The Doctor opens the trapdoor.)  
MOORE: Get up! Quick! Quick!  
DOCTOR: Come on! Come on!  
(They beat the Cybermen up the ladder and close the trapdoor again. The Doctor
seals it with the screwdriver.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, good team, Mrs Moore.

**[Battersea Power Station]**

CYBERMAN [OC]: Units upgraded now six thousand five hundred. Repeat. Six
thousand five hundred and rising.  
(A Cyberman stops the procession at Rose. Pete is right behind her.)  
CYBERMAN: You will wait.  
(It moves away.)  
PETE: You okay?  
ROSE: No.  
CYBERMAN [OC]: Chamber six now open for human upgrading. All reject stock will
be incinerated.  
(A woman walks into a chamber. Multiple blades whir into action, then a Cyber
head is lowered. Complete Cybermen walk out of chambers and clomp away.)  
PETE: Any sign of Jackie?  
(A Cyberman clomps up to them.)  
CYBERMAN: You are Peter Tyler. Confirm you are Peter Tyler.  
PETE: Confirmed.  
CYBERMAN: I recognise you. I went first. My name was Jacqueline Tyler.  
ROSE: No!  
PETE: What?  
CYBERMAN: They are unprogrammed. Restrain.  
PETE: You're lying. You're not her. You're not my Jackie!  
CYBERMAN: No, I am Cyber-form. Once I was Jacqueline Tyler.  
ROSE: But you can't be. Not her.  
CYBERMAN: Her brain is inside this body.  
PETE: Jacs, I came to save you.  
CYBERMAN: This man worked with Cybus Industries to create our species. He will
be rewarded by force. Take them to Cyber Control.  
(Pete and Rose are escorted away.)  
ROSE: They killed her. They just took her and killed her.  
PETE: Maybe there's a chance, I don't know. Maybe we can reverse it.  
ROSE: There's nothing we can do.  
PETE: But if, if she remembers. Where is she? Which one was it? Which one was
her?  
ROSE: They all look the same.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

(They dump a guard on the floor.)  
JAKE: Nice one. Nobody's home. Find the transmitter controls.  
MICKEY: What do they look like?  
JAKE: Well, I don't know. They might have Transmitter Controls written in big
red letters. Just look!  
(The Zeppelin has a nice big ship's wheel for steering. Then they see
something in an alcove.)  
JAKE: Cyberman!  
(Jake goes up to it with a pistol, and turns on the alcove light.)  
MICKEY: It's dead. I don't think it was ever alive.  
(Mickey knocks three times on its head.)  
MICKEY: It's empty. No brain. It's just a robot suit. It's for display.  
JAKE: Okay. Transmitter.

**[Corridor]**

CYBERMAN: You are not upgraded.  
MOORE: Yeah? Well, upgrade this.  
(She throws a small rod with copper wire wrapped around it at the Cyberman. It
sticks to the metal and the Cyberman jerks, then sparks and collapses.)  
DOCTOR: What the hell was that thing?  
MOORE: Electromagnetic bomb. Takes out computers, I figured it might stop the
cyber-suit.  
DOCTOR: You figured right. Now, let's have a look. Know your enemy. A logo on
the front. Lumic's turned them into a brand. Heart of steel, but look.  
(The Doctor removes the logo boss on the chest. Inside is not just
electronics.)  
MOORE: Is that flesh?  
DOCTOR: Hmmm. Central nervous system. Artificially grown then threaded
throughout the suit so it responds like a living thing. Well, it is a living
thing. Oh, but look. Emotional inhibitor. Stops them feeling anything.  
MOORE: But why?  
DOCTOR: It's still got a human brain. Imagine its reaction if it could see
itself, realise itself inside this thing. They'd go insane.  
MOORE: So they cut out the one thing that makes them human.  
DOCTOR: Because they have to.  
CYBERMAN: Why am I cold?  
MOORE: Oh, my God. It's alive. It can feel.  
DOCTOR: We broke the inhibitor. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.  
CYBERMAN: Why so cold?  
DOCTOR: Can you remember your name?  
CYBERMAN: Sally. Sally Phelan.  
MOORE: You're a woman.  
CYBERMAN: Where's Gareth?  
MOORE: Who's Gareth?  
CYBERMAN: He can't see me. It's unlucky the night before.  
MOORE: You're getting married.  
CYBERMAN: I'm cold. I'm so cold.  
DOCTOR: It's all right. You sleep now, Sally. Just go to sleep.  
(He puts the sonic screwdriver inside the chest cavity and switches her off.)  
DOCTOR: Sally Phelan didn't die for nothing, because that's the key. The
emotional inhibitor. If we could find the code behind it, the cancellation
code, then feed it throughout the system into every Cyberman's head, they'd
realise what they are.  
MOORE: And what happens then?  
DOCTOR: I think it would kill them. Could we do that?  
MOORE: We've got to. Before they kill everyone else. There's no choice,
Doctor. It's got to be done.  
(Mrs Moore stands up. A Cyberman grabs her shoulder and electrocutes her.)  
DOCTOR: No! No, you didn't have to kill her!  
CYBERMAN: Sensors detect a binary vascular system. You are an unknown upgrade.
You will be taken for analysis.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

MICKEY: The transmitter controls are sealed behind here, we need like an
oxyacetylene or something.  
JAKE: Oh, and I forgot to bring it with me.  
MICKEY: Well then, what do we do?  
JAKE: We'll crash the Zeppelin.  
MICKEY: With us inside it?  
JAKE: We could set it to automatic and then just leg it. Let's have a look.  
(They go to the steering controls keyboard.)  
JAKE: It's locked. There's got to be an override.  
MICKEY: Let me have a go. I'm good with computers. Trust me.  
(As Mickey works, a red light on the back of the keyboard blinks. The Cyberman
in the alcove turns.)

**[Control room]**

DOCTOR: I've been captured, but don't worry, Rose and Pete are still out
there. They can rescue me. Oh well, never mind. You okay?  
ROSE: Yeah. But they got Jackie.  
PETE: We were too late. Lumic killed her.  
DOCTOR: Then where is he, the famous Mister Lumic? Don't we get the chance to
meet our Lord and Master?  
CYBERMAN: He has been upgraded.  
DOCTOR: So he's just like you?  
CYBERMAN: He is superior. The Lumic Unit has been designated Cyber Controller.  
(A door opens and a Cyberman is wheeled out in an upgraded wheelchair.)  
LUMIC: This is The Age of Steel and I am its Creator.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

MICKEY: Almost there.  
JAKE: Not bad work.  
(The Cyberman flexes its hand.)  
JAKE: It's moving! You said it was dead!  
MICKEY: Yeah. But a robot's still a big robot. Wait a minute. Hey, Cyberman,
over here. Come on, you brainless lump of metal. Come and have a go!  
(Mickey stands in front of the panel labelled Transmitter Controls and beckons
to it. He ducks as the Cyberman smashes its fist into the panel and
electrocutes itself.)

**[Battersea Power Station]**

(The ear pods stop flashing. The unconverted people wake up.)  
WOMAN: Oh no!  
(Screams and panic.)

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

MICKEY: The transmitter's down!  
(The people push their way past the Cybermen and get outside.)

**[Control room]**

DOCTOR: That's my friends at work. Good boys! Mister Lumic, I think that's a
vote for free will.  
LUMIC: I have factories waiting on seven continents. If the ear pods have
failed, then the Cybermen will take humanity by force. London has fallen. So
shall the world.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

MICKEY: Hold on, I've logged on to Cyber Control.  
(A monitor shows the scene.)  
MICKEY: They're alive! The Doctor and Rose, there they are!  
JAKE: Never mind them, what the hell is that thing?  
MICKEY: Shush. Has this thing got sound?  
LUMIC [on monitor]: I will bring peace to the world. Everlasting peace

**[Control room]**

LUMIC: And unity and uniformity.  
DOCTOR: And imagination? What about that? The one thing that lead you here,
imagination, you're killing it dead!  
LUMIC: What is your name?  
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.  
LUMIC: A redundant title. Doctors need not exist. Cybermen never sicken.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, but that's it. That's exactly the point! Oh, Lumic, you're a
clever man. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. But everything
you've invented, you did to fight your sickness. And that's brilliant. That is
so human. But once you get rid of sickness and mortality, then what's there to
strive for, eh? The Cybermen won't advance. You'll just stop. You'll stay like
this forever. A metal Earth with metal men and metal thoughts, lacking the one
thing that makes this planet so alive. People. Ordinary, stupid, brilliant
people.  
LUMIC: You are proud of your emotions.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes.  
LUMIC: Then tell me, Doctor. Have you known grief, and rage, and pain?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes I have.  
LUMIC: And they hurt?  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes.  
LUMIC: I could set you free. Would you not want that? A life without pain?  
DOCTOR: You might as well kill me.  
LUMIC: Then I take that option.  
DOCTOR: It's not yours to take. You're a Cyber Controller. You don't control
me or anything with blood in its heart.  
LUMIC: You have no means of stopping me. I have an army. A species of my own.  
DOCTOR: You just don't get it, do you? An army's nothing. Because those
ordinary people, they're the key. The most ordinary person could change the
world.  
(The Doctor speaks to the camera with the flashing red light.)

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

DOCTOR [on monitor]: Some ordinary man or woman, some idiot. All it takes is
for him to find, say,

**[Control room]**

DOCTOR: The right numbers. Say the right codes. Say, for example, the code
behind the emotional inhibitor. The code right in front of him.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

DOCTOR [on monitor]: Because even an idiot knows how to use computers these
days.

**[Control room]**

DOCTOR: Knows how to get past firewalls and passwords. Lnows how to find
something encrypted in the Lumic Family Database, under er. What was it, Pete?
Binary what?  
PETE: Binary nine.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

MICKEY: Binary Nine.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: An idiot could find that code. Cancellation code.

**[Control room]**

DOCTOR: And he'd keep on typing.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

DOCTOR [on monitor]: Keep on fighting. Anything to save his friends.

**[Control room]**

LUMIC: Your words are irrelevant.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, talk too much, that's my problem. Lucky I got you that cheap
tariff, Rose, for all our long chats.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

(6879760 on the monitor.)  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: On your phone.  
MICKEY: The phone.

**[Control room]**

LUMIC: You will be deleted.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Delete, control, hash. All those lovely buttons. Then, of course,
my particular favourite, send. And let's not forget how you seduced all those
ordinary people in the first place.  
(Rose's phone beeps. The code has arrived as a text.)  
DOCTOR: By making every bit of technology compatible with everything else.  
ROSE: It's for you.  
DOCTOR: Like this.  
(The Doctor puts the phone into a docking station, which it miraculously fits.
The code is transmitted and the Cybermen cry out in pain. The code appears on
every computer screen.)

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

MICKEY + JAKE: Yes!

**[Control room]**

(Cybermen everywhere clutch their heads in pain. One near the Doctor catches
sight of itself in a shiny piece of metal.)  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.  
(Outside, a Cyberman's head explodes.)  
LUMIC: What have you done??  
DOCTOR: I gave them back their souls. They can see what you've done, Lumic,
and it's killing them!  
(The Doctor, Rose and Pete run out.)  
LUMIC: Delete! Delete! Delete!

**[Battersea Power Station]**

(Things start to explode. The emergency exit is blocked by writhing Cybermen.
More explosions and fire breaks out.)  
DOCTOR: There's no way out!

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

(Jake spins the Zeppelin's wheel.)  
MICKEY: What're you doing?  
JAKE: We've got to get away. If that factory blows up, this balloon's going to
ignite.  
MICKEY: Take it back!  
JAKE: Mickey, they've had it!  
MICKEY: I said, take it back! We're not leaving them behind. There's no way
we're leaving them behind!  
(They fight over the wheel. Mickey wins. The Zeppelin returns to the roof and
Mickey gives Jake his phone to put by his ear.)  
MICKEY: Hold it! Rose? Rose, can you hear me? Head for the roof!

**[Battersea Power Station]**

ROSE: It's Mickey. He says head for the roof.  
(The Doctor, Rose and Pete run up a metal staircase as fires break out behind
them.)

**[Control room]**

(Cyber Lumic disconnects himself from the chair and stands.)  
LUMIC: No!

**[Power Station roof]**

(Rose is on the phone.)  
ROSE: Mickey, where'd you learn to fly that thing?

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

MICKEY: Playstation. Just hold on, Rose. I'm coming to get you.  
JAKE: You can't go any lower.  
MICKEY: I've got to.  
JAKE: You're going to crush them.  
MICKEY: There's got to be something. There's got to be. Oh, yes.  
(In case of emergency pull lever. So he does. A trapdoor opens up in ZEP148
and a rope ladder falls out.)

**[Power station roof]**

PETE: You've got to be kidding.  
DOCTOR: Rose, get up.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

MICKEY: Hold on tight, we're going up! Welcome to Mickey Smith's Airline.
Please enjoy your flight. Woo!

**[Rope ladder]**

(The Zeppelin rises into the air.)  
ROSE: We did it! We did it!  
(Something heavy pulls at the ladder, nearly making them lose their grip. It
is Cyber Lumic. The Doctor gets the screwdriver out.)  
DOCTOR: Pete! Take this! Use it! Hold the button down! Press it against the
rope. Just do it!  
PETE: Jackie Tyler. This is for her!  
(The rope finally gives way and Lumic falls.)  
LUMIC: Argh!  
(He is engulfed in the exploding Power Station.)

**[Lambeth Pier]**

(The Doctor puts the power cell back into the console, and the Tardis starts
to light up.)  
PETE: So, what happens inside that thing, then?  
ROSE: Do you want to see?  
PETE: No, I don't think so. But you two, you know, all that stuff you said
about different worlds. Who are you?  
ROSE: It's like you say. Imagine there are different worlds, parallel worlds.
Worlds with another Pete Tyler and Jackie Tyler's still alive, and their
daughter.  
PETE: I've got to go.  
ROSE: But if you just look inside.  
PETE: No, I can't. There's all those Lumic factories out there. All those
Cybermen still in storage. Someone's got to tell the authorities what
happened, carry on the fight...  
DOCTOR: Rose? I've only got five minutes of power. We've got to go.  
ROSE: The Doctor could show you.  
PETE: Thank you. For everything.  
ROSE: Dad.  
PETE: Don't. Just, just don't.  
(Pete leaves.)  
MICKEY: Here it is. I found it. Not a crease.  
DOCTOR: My suit! Good man. Now then, Jake, we've got to run. But one more
thing. Mrs Moore. Her real name was Angela Price. She's got a husband out
there, and children. Find them. Tell them how she died saving the world.  
JAKE: Yeah, course I will.  
DOCTOR: Off we go, then.  
MICKEY: Er, thing is, I'm staying.  
DOCTOR: You're doing what?  
ROSE: You can't.  
MICKEY: It sort of balances out, because this world lost its Ricky, but
there's me. And there's work to be done with all those Cybermen still out
there.  
ROSE: But you can't stay.  
MICKEY: Rose, my gran's here. She's still alive. My old gran, remember her?  
ROSE: Yeah.  
MICKEY: She needs me.  
ROSE: What about me? What if I need you?  
MICKEY: Yeah, but Rose, you don't. It's just you and him, isn't it. We had
something a long time ago, but not anymore.  
ROSE: Well, we'll come back. We can travel anywhere. Come and see you, yeah?  
DOCTOR: We can't. I told you, travel between parallel worlds is impossible. We
only got here by accident. We, we fell through a crack in time. When we leave,
I've got to close it. We can't ever return.  
MICKEY: Doctor.  
(The Doctor shakes Mickey's hand.)  
DOCTOR: Take Rose's phone. It's got the code. Get it out there. Stop those
factories. And good luck, Mickey the idiot.  
MICKEY: Watch it.  
(The Doctor goes back into the Tardis. Rose gives Mickey her phone.)  
MICKEY: Thanks. We've had a laugh though, haven't we? Seen it all, been there
and back. Who would have thought, me and you off the old estate, flying
through the stars.  
ROSE: All those years just sitting there, imagining what we'd do one day. We
never saw this, did we?  
MICKEY: Go on, don't miss your flight.  
(Rose hugs Mickey, then goes into the Tardis, crying.)  
MICKEY: Jake, you want to watch this.  
(The TARDIS dematerialises.)  
JAKE: What the hell?  
MICKEY: That's the Doctor in the Tardis with Rose Tyler.

**[The Tyler's flat]**

(The Tardis materialises in the living room just as Jackie is filling the
kettle, presumably to make a cup of tea..)  
ROSE: You're alive. Oh mum, you're alive.  
JACKIE: Well, I was the last time I looked. What is it? What's happened,
sweetheart? What's wrong? Where did you go?  
DOCTOR: Far away. That was far away.  
JACKIE: Where's Mickey?  
DOCTOR: He's gone home.

**[Van]**

MICKEY: I know it's not easy with my face looking exactly like Ricky, but I'm
a different man. I'm not replacing him. But we can remember him by fighting in
his name. With all those Cyber factories out there, do you think they'll be
one in Paris?  
JAKE: Yeah.  
MICKEY: Then, let's go and liberate Paris.  
JAKE: What, you and me, in a van?  
MICKEY: There's nothing wrong with a van. I once saved the universe with a big
yellow truck.
