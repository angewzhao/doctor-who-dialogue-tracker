Original Airdate: 21 Jun, 2008  

**[Market place]**

(Pagodas and flying cars above small wind turbines. Down in the streets, lots
of banners with Chinese symbols on them. The Doctor hands Donna a mug of
foaming drink.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, ho, ho.  
DONNA: I'd rather have a water.  
DOCTOR: You are going to love it. One, two, three!  
DONNA: Lovely!  
(They carry on through the market.)  
SALESWOMAN: You want to buy shukina? Or peshmoni? Most beautiful peshmoni in
all of Shan Shen?  
DONNA: Er, no thanks.  
(The Doctor is haggling with another stallholder so Donna explores on her own.
A young woman in a black and gold robe calls to her.)  
FORTUNE TELLER: Tell your fortune, lady. The future predicted. Your life
foretold.  
DONNA: Oh, no thanks.  
FORTUNE TELLER: Don't you want to know if you're going to be happy?  
DONNA: I'm happy right now, thanks.  
FORTUNE TELLER: You got red hair. The reading's free for red hair.  
DONNA: All right, then.

**[Fortune teller's tent]**

(The young woman looks at Donna's palms.)  
FORTUNE TELLER: Oh, you fascinating. No, but you good. I can see a man. The
most remarkable man. How did you meet him?  
DONNA: You're supposed to tell me.  
FORTUNE TELLER: I see the future. Tell me the past. When did your lives cross?  
DONNA: It's sort of complicated. I ended up in a spaceship on my wedding day.
Long story.  
FORTUNE TELLER: But what led you to that meeting?  
DONNA: All sorts of things. But my job, I suppose. It was on Earth, this
planet called Earth, miles away. But I had this job as a temp. I was a
secretary at a place called HC Clements.  
(Donna has an intense flashback. It makes her sway.)  
DONNA: Oh. Sorry.  
FORTUNE TELLER: It's the incense. Just breathe deep. This job of yours. What
choices led you there?  
DONNA: There was a choice, six months before, because the Agency offered me
this contract with HC Clements

**[Car]**

DONNA [OC]: But there was this other job. My mum knew this man  
SYLVIA: Jival, he's called. Jival Chowdry? He runs that little photocopy
business and he needs a secretary.  
DONNA: I've got a job.  
SYLVIA: As a temp. This is permanent, it's twenty thousand a year, Donna.  
DONNA: HC Clements is in the City. It's nice, it's posh, so stop it.

**[Fortune teller's tent]**

FORTUNE TELLER: Your life could have gone one way or the other. What made you
decide?  
DONNA: I just did.  
(Our point of view is something small sneaking up behind Donna.)  
FORTUNE TELLER: But when was the moment? When did you choose?

**[Car]**

(Donna is at a junction, waiting to turn onto the main road.)  
SYLVIA: It won't take long. Just turn right. We'll pop in and see Mister
Chowdry, so Suzette can introduce you.  
DONNA: I'm going left. If you don't like it, get out and walk.  
SYLVIA: If you turn right, you'll have a career, not just filling in.  
DONNA: You think I'm so useless.  
SYLVIA: Oh, I know why you want a job at HC Clements, lady. Because you think
you'll meet a man with lots of money and your whole life will change. Well let
me tell you, sweetheart. City executives don't need temps, except for
practice.  
DONNA: Yeah. Well, they haven't met me.

**[Fortune teller's tent]**

FORTUNE TELLER: You turned left. But what if you turned right? What then?  
DONNA: Let go of my hands.  
FORTUNE TELLER: What if it changes? What if you go right? What if you could
still go right?  
DONNA: Stop it.  
(Something jumps onto Donna's back.)  
DONNA: What's that? What's on my back? What is it? What, what's on my back?  
FORTUNE TELLER: Make the choice again, Donna Noble, and change your mind. Turn
right.  
(A hooked claw reaches to Donna's shoulder.)  
DONNA: I'm turning.  
FORTUNE TELLER: Turn right. Turn right. Turn right!

**[Car]**

SYLVIA: Well, let me tell you, sweetheart. City executives don't need temps,
except for practice.  
DONNA: Yeah. Suppose you're right.  
FORTUNE TELLER [OC]: Turn right, and never meet that man. Turn right, and
change the world.  
(Donna turns right.)

**[Public house]**

(The girls office Christmas get together. Donna is carrying a tray of drinks.)  
DONNA: Come on, then, get out the way. Get out the way! Here we are. Feed at
the trough.  
VEENA: Mooky says let's go to the Boardwalk. It's two for the price of one.  
DONNA: Christmas Eve? It'll be heaving.  
MOOKY: Well, exactly, Get in and grab them.  
VEENA: Hey, that's the second round of drinks you've bought. It was my turn.  
DONNA: I can afford it. Promotion. You are talking to Jival Chowdry's Personal
Assistant, I'll have you know. Capital P, capital A, twenty three thousand
pound per annum, merci beaucoup.  
VEENA: Here's to Mister Chowdry.  
ALL: Mister Chowdry!  
MOOKY: She gets all the luck.  
(A blonde woman is staring at Donna.)  
DONNA: What's wrong? What is it?  
ALICE: Sorry?  
DONNA: Did someone spill a drink on me?  
ALICE: Why?  
DONNA: Why do you keep looking at my shoulder? What's wrong?  
ALICE: I don't know.  
DONNA: Oh, don't tell me you're getting all spooky again. It was bad enough
when you saw the ghost of Earl Mountbatten at the boat show. What are you
looking at? What is it?  
ALICE: It's like, it's like there's something I can't see.  
(A man bursts in.)  
MAN: Come on, shut up, all of you. Come and see. Just look at the sky! It's a
star! It's a Christmas star!  
VEENA: Well, come on then.

**[Outside the pub]**

MOOKY: What the hell is that?  
VEENA: Ken Livingstone, that's what! Spending our money on decorations! I
mean, how much did that cost?  
(The Racnoss web ship is sailing across the sky.)  
MOOKY: Don't be so stupid. It's flying! It's really flying!  
(The people run around the corner to watch it.)  
DONNA: That's not a star. That's a web. It's heading east. Middle of the City.  
(Energy lances from the web star and everyone starts screaming and running,
except Donna and Alice.)  
DONNA: Alice! There's a great big web star thing shooting at people, and
you're looking at me?  
ALICE: There is something on your back.  
(Alice runs away. Donna walks forward.)  
VEENA: Donna? Donna, where are you going? You'll get yourself killed! Donna!

**[Canary Wharf]**

SOLDIER: Fire!  
(Tanks shoot at the web star. Donna arrives at a barricade.)  
SOLDIER: Everyone, stay back. The Thames has been closed. Return to your
homes. Keep away from the river, and that's an order.  
(Donna quietly sneaks around the back to the Army trucks.)  
OFFICER [OC]: Trap One to Greyhound Fifteen. What is your report? Over.  
HARRIS: From the evidence, I'd say he managed to stop the creature. Some sort
of red spider. Blew up the base underneath the barrier, flooded the whole
thing. Over.  
OFFICER [OC]: And where is he now? Over.  
HARRIS: We found a body, sir. Over.  
(Ambulance personnel bring a body on a stretcher.)  
OFFICER [OC]: Is it him? Over.  
HARRIS: I think so. He just didn't make it out in time.  
(As the stretcher is lifted into the ambulance, an arm drops from under the
blanket and drops a sonic screwdriver to the ground.)  
HARRIS: The Doctor is dead. Must have happened too fast for him to regenerate.
Escort the ambulance back to UNIT base.  
(Donna walks on. A blonde woman runs towards her. She speaks as if her top lip
is glued to her teeth.)  
ROSE: What happened? What did they find? I'm sorry, did they find someone?  
DONNA: I don't know. A bloke called the Doctor, or something.  
ROSE: Well, where is he?  
DONNA: They took him away. He's dead. I'm sorry, did you know him? I mean,
they didn't say his name. Could be any doctor.  
ROSE: I came so far.  
DONNA: It, it could be anyone.  
ROSE: What's your name?  
DONNA: Donna. And you?  
ROSE: Oh, I was just passing by. I shouldn't even be here. This is wrong. It's
wrong. This is so wrong. Sorry, what was it? Donna what?  
DONNA: Why do you keep looking at my back?  
ROSE: I'm not.  
DONNA: Yes, you are. You keep looking behind me. You're doing it now. What is
it? What's there? Did someone put something on my back?  
(Donna tries to look at her own back, and Rose disappears.)

**[General office]**

DONNA: You can't sack me. I'm your personal assistant!  
CHOWDRY: You don't have to make a scene. Just come downstairs and we can have
a little talk.  
DONNA: Oh, I'll make a scene, all right, right in front of a tribunal. And the
first thing I'm going to say is wandering hands!  
CHOWDRY: Now, come on, Donna. You know what it's been like for the past few
months, ever since that Christmas thing. Half my contracts were on the other
side of the river and the Thames is still closed off. Look, I can't deliver.
I'm losing a fortune.  
DONNA: Well, sack one of this lot. Sack Cliff. He just sits there. Don't know
what he does all day. Sorry, Cliff. Actually, I'm not sorry. What do you do
all day?  
(Boom! the building shakes.)  
CHOWDRY: What the hell? Like an earthquake.  
(A black cloud is gathering in the sky.)  
CHOWDRY: That's weird. Funny sort of clouds.  
DONNA: Who typed this? I'm your PA. Did you get somebody else to type this?
Beatrice?  
NEWS 24 [on TV]: It sounds impossible, but the entire hospital has vanished.
The Royal Hope no longer exists. It's not been destroyed, there's no wreckage.
It's simply gone. Reports from bystanders say that the rain lifted up around
the hospital  
(Donna is clearing her desk.)  
DONNA: Hole punch. Having that. Stapler, mine. Toy cactus. You can have that,
Beatrice. Catch. Cliff, I'd leave you the mouse mat, but I'm worried you'd cut
yourself.  
CHOWDRY: All right, Donna, have some respect. There's two thousand people in
that hospital, and it's vanished.  
DONNA: Oh, I'll show you vanishing. Thanks for nothing. Oh, and you know when
that money went missing from the kitty? Anne-Marie, that's all I'm saying.
Anne-Marie!  
(Boom, rattle.)  
DONNA: Don't tell me, the hospital's back. Well, isn't that wizard.

**[Nobles' home]**

NEWS 24 [on TV]: To confirm, the Royal Hope hospital was returned to it's
original position, but with only one survivor. The only person left alive is
medical student Oliver Morgenstern.  
MORGENSTERN [on TV]: And there were these creatures, like rhinos. Talking
rhinos, in, in, in black leather. DONNA: Rhinos?  
WILF: Rhinos could be aliens.  
DONNA: Shush.  
MORGENSTERN: There were hundreds of them. We couldn't breathe. We were running
out of air. A colleague of mine gave me the last oxygen tank. Martha. Martha
Jones. And she died.  
SYLVIA: At least you got a hole punch and a raffle ticket.  
DONNA: Yeah, well, they can keep the raffle. I won't take a penny off that
man.  
WILF: Honestly, you two. There's aliens on the news. They took that hospital
all the way to the moon, and you're banging on about raffle tickets.  
DONNA: Don't be daft, Gramps. It wasn't the moon. It couldn't be.  
WILF: Yes, well, I am telling you it is getting worse, these past few years.
It's like, all of a sudden, they suddenly know all about us, and there's keen
eyes up there and they're watching us, and they're not friendly.  
SYLVIA: This stapler says Bea.  
DONNA: I can't believe how well you're taking it, me getting sacked. Thought
you'd hit the roof.  
SYLVIA: I'm just tired, Donna, what with your father and everything. To be
honest, I've given up on you.  
NEWS 24 [on TV]: This further report just in from Oliver Morgenstern.  
MORGENSTERN [on TV]: There was this woman who took control. Said she knew what
to do, said she could stop the MRI or something. Sarah Jane, her name was.
Sarah Jane Smith.  
NEWS 24 [on TV]: Sarah Jane Smith was a freelance investigative journalist,
formerly of Metropolitan Magazine.  
(Yes, our Sarah Jane. Apparently the BBC made a children's show with her.)  
Her body was recovered from the hospital late this afternoon. Miss Smith had a
son called Luke, but early reports that Luke  
DONNA: What's for tea?  
SYLVIA: I've got nothing in.  
DONNA: I'll get chips. Last of my wages. Fish and chips, yeah?  
NEWS 24 [on TV]: Also had been inside the Royal Hope, along with his teenage
friends Maria Jackson and Clyde Langer. It is feared that they also perished.

**[Street]**

(Night. Donna is walking slowly when there is a blinding flash in a nearby
jennel and Rose runs out.)  
DONNA: Blimey! Are you all right? What was that, fireworks or  
ROSE: I don't know. I was just walking along. That's weird.  
DONNA: You're the one. Christmas Eve. I met you in town.  
ROSE: Donna? Isn't it?  
DONNA: What was your name?  
ROSE: How're you doing? You're looking good. How's things, what have you been
up to?  
DONNA: You're doing it again.  
ROSE: What?  
DONNA: Looking behind me. People keep on doing that, looking at my back.  
ROSE: What sort of people?  
DONNA: People in the street. Strangers. I just catch them sometimes, staring
at me. Like they're looking at something. And then I get home, and I look, and
there's nothing there. See? Look, now I'm doing it!  
ROSE: What are you doing for Christmas?  
DONNA: What am I what?  
ROSE: Next Christmas. Any plans?  
DONNA: I don't know. That's ages away. Nothing much, I suppose. Why?  
ROSE: Just, I think you should get out, you and your family. Don't stay in
London. Just leave the city.  
DONNA; What for?  
ROSE: Nice hotel Christmas break?  
DONNA; Can't afford it.  
ROSE: Well, no, you got that raffle ticket.  
DONNA: How do you know about that?  
ROSE: First prize, luxury weekend break. Use it, Donna Noble.  
DONNA: Why won't you tell me your name? I think you should leave me alone.  
(Donna walks on. There is a flash of light behind her.)

**[Firbourne House Hotel]**

(Noddy is screaming out his song as they drive up to the converted country
house.)  
WILF: Cor blimey, that's what I call posh. I said you were lucky, didn't I? I
always said, my lucky star.  
(Wilf is wearing antlers on his head. Two men come up to help them unload the
car.)  
SYLVIA: Look, for God's sake don't tell them we won it in a raffle. Be classy.
Dad, take those things off.  
WILF: No, I shan't. It's Christmas. Oi, I'll have that one, thank you. It's
got my liniment in it.  
DONNA: I reckon we deserve this. It's been a hell of a year.  
SYLVIA: Your dad would have loved this.  
DONNA: Yeah. He would have.

**[Hotel room]**

(There is a knock on the door.)  
DONNA: Oi, Gramps, get that. That'll be breakfast. We've got croissants.  
(Poor old Wilf had to sleep on the sofa. Sylvia is still in bed, eating
chocolates.)  
WILF: Why can't you get it, Lady Muck?  
SYLVIA: It's Christmas Day, I never get up before ten. Only madam there was up
with the dawn chorus, like when she was six years old.  
DONNA: I'm not wasting a second in this place. How was the sofa?  
WILF: Oh, yeah. Oh, not so good, really. Oh gawd. You know, we could have paid
for a second room. Oi! Merry Christmas.  
DONNA: Merry Christmas.  
SYLVIA: Merry Christmas, Dad.  
(A knock at the door.)  
WILF: Yeah, all right. Come on in, my darling. Grub's up. Merry Christmas!  
MAID: Merry Christmas, sir!  
NEWS 24 [on TV]: We have interrupted your programme to bring you breaking
news.  
SYLVIA: Have you seen this?  
NEWS 24 [on TV]: We will now return to the BBC news studio.  
DONNA: Because I thought, nice early breakfast and then we'll go for a walk.
People always say that at Christmas. Oh, we all went for a walk. I've always
wanted to do that. So, walk first, presents later, yeah?  
SYLVIA: Donna, come and see.  
SPANISH MAID: Tienes algo en tu espalda.  
NEWS 24 [on TV]: Satellite.  
DONNA: What?  
SYLVIA: Donna, look at the telly.  
SPANISH MAID: Tienes algo en tu espalda.  
NEWS 24 [on TV]: Replica of the RMS Titanic.  
DONNA: What does that mean? I don't know what you're saying.  
SYLVIA: Donna, look at the TV!  
SPANISH MAID: Tienes algo en tu espalda!  
(The claws are visible by Donna's shoulders, but the bathroom mirror reveals
nothing. The maid flees. )  
SYLVIA: For God's sake, Donna. Don't just stand there, come and look.  
NEWS 24 [on TV]: Not sure how this is possible, but this footage is live and
genuine. The object is falling on Central London. I repeat, this is not a
hoax. A replica of the Titanic is falling out of the sky, and it's heading for
Buckingham Palace. We're getting this footage from the Guinevere range of
satellites.  
DONNA: Is that a film or something?  
NEWS 24 [on TV]: The Royal Air Force has declared an emerg  
(The Titanic crashes into Buckingham Palace and the picture is lost. A
shockwave rattles the hotel.)  
SYLVIA: It's gone dead. All of them.  
DONNA: No, but, the Titanic? Well, don't be daft. Is that like a sequel?  
(Wilf looks out of the window.)  
WILF: Oh. Oh, God rest their souls.

**[Firbourne House Hotel]**

(The guests and staff go outside and look down the valley, to the viaduct and
beyond, to where a mushroom cloud is rising.)  
WILF: I was supposed to be out there selling papers. I should have been there.
We all should. We'd be dead.  
SYLVIA: That's everyone. Every single person we know. The whole city.  
DONNA: Can't be.  
SYLVIA: But it is. It's gone. London's gone.  
WILF: If you hadn't won that raffle.  
(Donna turns to see the maid pointing an accusing finger at her.)

**[Housing office]**

(A makeshift premises.)  
DONNA: Leeds? I'm not moving to Leeds.  
HOUSING OFFICER: I'm afraid it's Leeds or you can wait in the hostel for
another three months.  
SYLVIA: All I want's a washing machine.  
DONNA: What about Glasgow? I heard there was jobs going in Glasgow.  
HOUSING OFFICER: You can't pick and choose. We've the whole of Southern
England flooded with radiation. Seven million people in need of relocation,
and now France has closed its borders. So, it's Leeds or nothing. Next!

**[Leeds Street]**

(The Nobles are relocated by army bus and dropped off in a terraced street
with lots of other families..)  
SOLDIER: The Daniels Family, billeted at number fifteen. Mister and Mrs Obego,
billeted at number thirty one. Miss Coltrane, you're in number eight. The
Noble family, billeted at number twenty nine.  
(Wilf picks up his telescope.)  
WILF: That's us. Come on, off we go. All right?  
WOMAN: Used to be a nice little family, number twenty nine. They missed one
mortgage payment. Just one. They got booted out. All for you lot.  
DONNA: Don't get all chippy with me, Vera Duckworth. Pop your clogs on and go
and feed whippets.  
WILF: Sweetheart, come on. You're not going to make the world any better by
shouting at it.  
DONNA: I can try.  
(Outside number 29.)  
SYLVIA: What happens? Do we get keys?  
WILF: I don't know, do I?  
SYLVIA: Who do we ask? The soldiers?  
(The front door opens.)  
ROCCO: Hey, hey. Is a big house. Room for all. Welcome! In you come.  
DONNA: I thought this was our house.  
ROCCO: Is many peoples house. Is wonderful. In, in, in.

**[Number 29]**

ROCCO: We've been here for eight weeks already. I had a nice little paper shop
in Shepherd's Bush. All gone now. So, upstairs, we have Merchandani family.
Seven of them. Good family. Good kids. Except that one. You be careful of him.
I's a joking! Where's that smile, eh? Rocco Colasanto. I'm here with my wife
and her sister and her husband and their kids and their daughter's kids. We've
got the front room. My mother, she's got the back room. She's old. You
forgive, eh?. And this? This is you. This is your palazzo.

**[Kitchen]**

(The galley kitchen has camp beds on the floor, and a curtain for a door.)  
SYLVIA: What do you mean, this is us?  
ROCCO: You live here.  
DONNA: We're living in the kitchen?  
ROCCO: You got camp beds. You got the cooker, you keep warm. You got the
fridge, you keep cool. Is good, eh?  
SYLVIA: What about the bathroom?  
ROCCO: Nobody lives in the bathroom.  
SYLVIA: No, I mean, is there a rota?  
ROCCO: Is pot-luck! Is fun. I go wake Mamma. She likes new people. Mamma! Is
people! Nice people!  
(Rocco leaves.)  
WILF: Ah, well. We'll settle in, won't we? Make do? Bit of wartime spirit, eh?  
DONNA: Yeah, but there isn't a war. There's no fight. It's just this.  
WILF: Well, America, they'll save us. It was on the news. They're going to
send Great Britain fifty billion quid in financial aid. God bless America.
(Later, at mealtime -)  
AMNN [on TV]: America is in crisis, with over sixty million reported dead.
Sixty million people have dissolved into fat. And the fat is walking. People's
fat has come to life and is walking through the streets. And there are
spaceships. There are reports of spaceships over every major US city. The fat
is flying. It's leaving  
WILF: Aliens.  
DONNA: Yeah.  
AMNN [on TV]: the fat creatures are being raised into the air  
(Bedtime, lit by tea-lights. Sylvia and Donna's beds are head to head.)  
SYLVIA: Mary McGinty. Do you remember her?  
DONNA: Who was she?  
SYLVIA: Worked in the newsagent on Sunday. Little woman. Black hair.  
DONNA: Never really spoke to her.  
SYLVIA: She'll be dead. Every day I think of someone else. All dead.  
DONNA: Maybe she went away for Christmas.  
SYLVIA: Maybe.  
DONNA: I'll go out tomorrow. I'll walk into town. There's got to be work.
Everyone needs secretaries. Soon as I'm earning, we'll get a proper place.
Just you wait, Mum.  
SYLVIA: What if it never gets better?  
DONNA: Course it will.  
SYLVIA: Even the bees are disappearing. You don't see bumble bees anymore.  
DONNA: They'll sort us out. The emergency government. They'll do something.  
SYLVIA: What if they don't?  
DONNA: Then we'll complain.  
SYLVIA: Who's going to listen to us? Refugees. We haven't even got a vote.
We're just no one, Donna. We don't exist.  
(There is singing in the front room.)  
ROCCO [OC]: And I spent all my money on whiskey and beer.  
DONNA: I am going to kill that man!

**[Front room]**

DONNA: Now listen, Mussolini! I am telling you for the last time to button it!
If I hear one more sea shanty  
(Rocco steps to the side, to reveal -)  
WILF: I always loved a sing song.  
(So, on the principle of if you can't beat them, join them.)  
ALL: I'm just a poor boy. Nobody loves me. He's just a poor boy from a poor
family. Spare him his life from this monstrosity. Easy come, easy go, will you
let me go? Bismillah, no  
(Gunfire outside.)  
ROCCO: No, you stay here. Everyone, stay.

**[Leeds Street]**

(A soldier is trying to kill his jeep, which is pumping out thick exhaust
gas.)  
ROCCO: Hey! Firing at the car is not so good. You, you crazy or what?  
SOLDIER: It's this ATMOS thing, it won't stop. It's like gas. It's toxic.  
WILF: Well, switch it off.  
SOLDIER: I have done. It's still going. It's all the cars. Every single ATMOS
car, they've gone mad. You, lady. Turn round! Turn around now!  
(The soldier aims his weapon at Donna.)  
ROCCO: Are you crazy, boy?  
WILF: Put the gun down!  
SOLDIER: I said, turn round! Show me your back!  
SYLVIA: Do what he says!  
SOLDIER: Show me your back!  
SYLVIA: Turn around!  
SOLDIER: Turn around, now! Show me your back!  
(Donna raises her arms and turns around slowly.)  
SOLDIER: Sorry. I thought I saw.  
WILF: Call yourself a soldier? Pointing guns at innocent women? You're a
disgrace. In my day, we'd have had you court martialled!  
(Donna sees a bright flash of light at the bottom of the street, and walks
towards it.)  
SYLVIA: Donna? Where are you going? It's not safe at night. Donna! Donna!

**[Street]**

(Around the corner.)  
DONNA: Hello.  
ROSE: Hi.

**[Park]**

ROSE: It's the ATMOS devices. We're lucky, it's not so bad here. Britain
hasn't got that much petrol. But all over Europe, China, South Africa, they're
getting choked by gas.  
DONNA: Can't anyone stop it?  
ROSE: Yeah, they're trying right now, this little band of fighters, on board
the Sontaran ship. Any second now.  
(The sky burns.)  
DONNA: And that was?  
ROSE: That was the Torchwood team. Gwen Cooper, Ianto Jones, they gave their
lives. And Captain Jack Harkness has transported to the Sontaran home world.
There's no one left.  
DONNA: You're always wearing the same clothes. Why won't you tell me your
name?  
ROSE: None of this was meant to happen. There was a man. This wonderful man,
and he stopped it. The Titanic, the Adipose, the ATMOS, he stopped them all
from happening.  
DONNA: That Doctor?  
ROSE: You knew him.  
DONNA: Did I? When?  
ROSE: I think you dream about him sometimes. It's a man in a suit. Tall, thin
man. Great hair. Some really great hair.  
DONNA: Who are you?  
ROSE: I was like you. I used to be you. You've travelled with him, Donna.
You've travelled with the Doctor in a different world.  
DONNA: I never met him, and he's dead.  
ROSE: He died underneath the Thames on Christmas Eve, but you were meant to be
there. He needed someone to stop him, and that was you. You made him leave.
You saved his life.  
(Donna has a memory of the Racnoss Queen, and water bursting into the tunnels
below the Thames.)  
DONNA [memory]: Doctor, you can stop now.  
DONNA: Stop it. I don't know what you're talking about. Leave me alone!  
ROSE: Something's coming, Donna. Something worse.  
DONNA: The whole world is stinking. How can anything be worse than this?  
ROSE: Trust me. We need the Doctor more than ever. I've, I've been pulled
across from a different universe because every single universe is in danger.
It's coming, Donna. It's coming from across the stars and nothing can stop it.  
DONNA: What is?  
ROSE: The darkness.  
DONNA: Well, what do you keep telling me for? What am I supposed to do? I'm
nothing special. I mean, I'm, I'm not. I'm nothing special. I'm a temp. I'm
not even that. I'm nothing.  
ROSE: Donna Noble, you're the most important woman in the whole of creation.  
DONNA: Oh, don't. Just don't. I'm tired. I'm so tired.  
ROSE: I need you to come with me.  
DONNA: Yeah. Well, blonde hair might work on the men, but you ain't shifting
me, lady.  
ROSE: That's more like it.  
DONNA: I've got plenty more.  
ROSE: Then you'll come with me, only when you want to.  
DONNA: You'll have a long wait, then.  
ROSE: Not really. Just three weeks. Tell me, does your grandfather still own
that telescope?  
DONNA: He never lets go of it.  
ROSE: Three weeks time. But you've got to be certain. Because when you come
with me, Donna, sorry, so sorry, but you're going to die.  
(Rose fades away.)

**[Outside No 29]**

ROCCO: And you! I'm going to miss you most of all. All flame-haired and firey.  
DONNA: Oh, but why do you have to go?  
ROCCO: It's the new law. England for the English, et cetera. They can't send
us home. The oceans are closed! They build labour camps.  
DONNA: I know, but labour doing what? There aren't any jobs.  
ROCCO: Sewing, digging. Is good. Now, stop it before I kiss you too much.  
(Rocco kisses Donna on both cheeks.)  
ROCCO: Wilfred. My capitano.  
(Rocco salutes Wilf, who returns the honour. Rocco joins his family on the
back in the army truck.)  
DONNA: It'll be quiet with him gone. Still, we'll have more room.  
WILF: Labour camps. That's what they called them last time.  
DONNA: What do you mean?  
WILF: It's happening again.  
DONNA: What is? Excuse me? Excuse me, where are you taking them? Where are you
going? Rocco, where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going?

**[Number 29]**

DONNA: I asked about jobs with the army. They said I wasn't qualified. You
were right. You said I should have worked harder at school. I suppose I've
always been a disappointment.  
SYLVIA: Yeah.

**[Garden]**

(Wilf has got a fire going in a brazier, and his telescope is set up.)  
WILF: You know, we'd get a bit of cash if we sold this thing.  
DONNA: Don't you dare. I always imagined, your old age, I'd have put a bit of
money by. Make you comfy. Never did. I'm just useless. You're supposed to say,
no you're not.  
WILF: Ha, it must be the alignment.  
DONNA: What's wrong?  
WILF: Well, I don't know. I mean, it can't be the lens, because I was looking
at Orion. The constellation of Orion. You take a look. And tell me, what can
you see?  
DONNA: Where?  
WILF: Well, up there in the sky.  
DONNA: Well, I can't see anything. It's just black.  
WILF: Well, I mean, it's working. The telescope is working.  
DONNA: Well, maybe it's clouds.  
WILF: There is no clouds.  
DONNA: Well, there must be.  
WILF: There's not! It was there. An entire constellation. Look. Look there.
They're going out. Oh, my God! Donna, look. The stars are going out.  
DONNA: I'm ready.  
(Rose is standing behind her.)

**[Warehouse]**

(A UNIT Land Rover delivers them to a warehouse filled with scientific
equipment, UNIT soldiers and people in white lab coats.)  
TANNOY: Lodestone testing now at fifteen point four. Repeat, fifteen point
four.  
(A woman officer salutes Rose.)  
MAGAMBO: Ma'am.  
ROSE: I've told you, don't salute.  
MAGAMBO: Well, if you're not going to tell us your name.  
(Rose goes to a control console.)  
DONNA: What, you don't know either?  
ROSE: I've crossed too many different realities. Trust me, the wrong word in
the wrong place can change an entire causal nexus.  
MAGAMBO: She talks like that. A lot. And you must be Miss Noble.  
DONNA: Donna.  
MAGAMBO: Captain Erisa Magambo. Thank you for this.  
DONNA: I don't even know what I'm doing.  
ROSE: Is it awake?  
MAGAMBO: Seems to be quiet today. Ticking over. Like it's waiting.  
(It is the Tardis, hooked up to some equipment by connectors on the outside.)  
ROSE: Do you want to see it?  
DONNA: What's a police box?  
ROSE: They salvaged it from underneath the Thames. Just go inside.  
DONNA: What for?  
ROSE: Just go in.  
(Donna enters the Tardis.)  
DONNA [OC]: No way.  
(Donna comes back out, checks the outside, then goes back inside, then finally
out again.)  
ROSE: What do you think?  
DONNA: Can I have a coffee?

**[Tardis]**

ROSE: Time And Relative Dimension In Space. This room used to shine with
light. I think it's dying.  
(Rose strokes the time rotor and it moves a little.)  
ROSE: Still trying to help.  
DONNA: And, and it belonged to the Doctor?  
ROSE: He was a Time Lord. Last of his kind.  
DONNA: But if he was so special, what was he doing with me?  
ROSE: He thought you were brilliant.  
DONNA: Don't be stupid.  
ROSE: But you are. It just took the Doctor to show you that, simply by being
with him. He did the same to me. To everyone he touches.  
DONNA: Were you and him?  
(Rose strokes Donna's shoulder.)  
ROSE: Do you want to see it?  
DONNA: No. Go on, then.

**[Warehouse]**

(A circle of mirrors and arc lights has been set up.)  
ROSE: We don't know how the Tardis works, but we've managed to scrape off the
surface technology, enough to show you the creature.  
DONNA: It's a creature?  
ROSE: Just stand here.  
MAGAMBO: Out of the circle, please.  
ROSE: Yes, ma'am.  
(Rose leaves Donna in the middle of the mirrors.)  
DONNA: Can't you stay with me?  
MAGAMBO: Ready. And activate.  
(The lights come on.)  
ROSE: Open your eyes, Donna.  
DONNA: Is it there?  
ROSE: Open your eyes. Look at it.  
DONNA: I can't.  
ROSE: It's part of you, Donna. Look.  
(A giant stag horn beetle is hanging on Donna's back like a rucksack.)  
ROSE: It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Calm down, Donna. Donna? Donna! Okay.  
DONNA: What is it?  
ROSE: We don't know.  
DONNA: Oh, thanks.  
ROSE: It feeds off time, by changing time. By making someone's life take a
different turn, like er, meetings never made, children never born, a life
never loved. But with you, it's  
DONNA: But I never did anything important.  
ROSE: Yeah, you did. One day that thing made you turn right instead of left.  
DONNA: When was that?  
ROSE: Oh, you wouldn't remember. It was the most ordinary day in the world.
But by turning right, you never met the Doctor, and the whole world just
changed around you.  
DONNA: Can you get rid of it?  
ROSE: No, I can't even touch it. It seems to be in a state of flux.  
DONNA: What does that mean?  
ROSE: I don't know. It's the sort of thing the Doctor would say.  
DONNA: You liar! You told me I was special. But it's not me, it's this thing.
I'm just a host!  
ROSE: No, there's more than that. The readings are strange. It's, it's like
reality's just bending round you.  
DONNA: Because of this thing!  
ROSE: No, no! We're getting separate readings from you. And they've always
been there, since the day you were born.  
MAGAMBO: This is not relevant to the mission.  
ROSE: I thought it was just the Doctor we needed, but it's the both of you.
The Doctor and Donna Noble, together, to stop the stars from going out.  
DONNA: Why? What can I do? Turn it off, please.  
ROSE: Captain.  
MAGAMBO: Power down.  
(Rose goes to Donna.)  
DONNA: It's still there, though. What can I do to get rid of it?  
ROSE: You're going to travel in time.  
(Donna is wearing a jacket with lots of wires all over it.)  
ROSE: The Tardis has tracked down the moment of intervention. Monday the
twenty fifth, one minute past ten in the morning. Your car was on Little
Sutton Street leading to the Ealing Road, but you turned right heading towards
Griffin's Parade. You need to turn left. That's the most important thing.
You've got to go back, turn left. Have you got that, Donna? One minute past
ten, make yourself turn left, heading for the Chiswick Highroad.  
MAGAMBO: Keep the jacket on at all times. It's insulation against temporal
feedback. This will correspond to local time wherever you land.  
A scientist puts a high tech watch on Donna's wrist. Captain Magambo holds out
a glass of water.  
MAGAMBO: This is to combat dehydration.  
(Donna is escorted back to the mirrors.)  
ROSE: This is where we leave you.  
DONNA: I don't want to see that thing on my back.  
ROSE: No, the mirrors are just incidental. They bounce chronon energy back
into the centre which we control and decide the destination.  
DONNA: It's a time machine.  
ROSE: It's a time machine.  
MAGAMBO: If you could?  
(Donna takes her place in the middle.)  
MAGAMBO: Powering up.  
DONNA: How do you know it's going to work?  
ROSE: Hmm? Oh yeah, we, we don't. We're just, we're just guessing.  
DONNA: Oh, brilliant.  
ROSE: Just remember, when you get to the junction, change the car's direction
by one minute past ten.  
DONNA: How do I do that?  
ROSE: It's up to you.  
DONNA: Well, I just have to run up to myself and have a good argument.  
ROSE: I'd like to see that!  
MAGAMBO: Activate lodestone.  
ROSE: Good luck.  
DONNA: I'm ready.  
ROSE: One minute past ten.  
DONNA: Because I understand now. You said I was going to die, but you mean
this whole world is going to blink out of existence. But that's not dying,
because a better world takes its place. The Doctor's world. And I'm still
alive. That's right, isn't it? I don't die. If I change things, I don't die.
That's that's right, isn't it?  
ROSE: I'm sorry.  
DONNA: But I can't die. I've got a future. With the Doctor. You told me!  
MAGAMBO: Activate!  
(Sparks fly along the power cables running to the Tardis, and Donna
dematerialises.)

**[Sutton Court]**

(Donna is on her hands and knees outside a cafe. She rejoices briefly.)  
DONNA: But hold on. But this is. I'm not. This is Sutton Court. I'm half a
mile away. I'm half a mile away!  
(The chronometer says 9:57.)  
DONNA: Four minutes? Oh, my God.  
(She starts running.)

**[Car]**

SYLVIA: Jival Chowdry. He runs that little photocopy business in Merchant
Street, and he needs a secretary.  
DONNA: I've got a job. HC Clements is in the City. It's nice, it's posh, so
stop it.  
(Donna and Sylvia are at the junction, waiting to turn.)  
SYLVIA: It won't take long. Just turn right.  
DONNA: I'm going left. If you don't like it, get out and walk. You think I'm
so useless.  
SYLVIA: Oh, I know why you want a job with HC Clements, lady. Because you
think you'll meet a man.

**[Ealing Road]**

(Donna has run out of breath, and it is 9:59.)  
DONNA: I'm not going to get there.  
ROSE: You're going to die.  
(Donna sees a van coming towards her. It has just passed the junction the car
is waiting at.)

**[Car]**

SYLVIA: City executives don't need temps, except for practice.  
DONNA: Yeah. Suppose you're right.

**[Ealing Road]**

DONNA: Please.  
(Donna steps out in front of the van. The driver stands on the brakes. A woman
screams.)

**[Car]**

(Sylvia hears her.)  
SYLVIA: Can you hear that?

**[Ealing Road]**

(The driver gets out and waves at the taxi behind.)  
DRIVER: Hold on! Back up!  
TAXI DRIVER: Oi, get a move on.

**[Car]**

DONNA: The traffic's stopping.  
SYLVIA: Something must have happened.

**[Ealing Road]**

ROSE: Tell him this. Two words.  
(Rose whispers in dying Donna's ear.)

**[Car]**

(The tailback is past her junction now.)  
DONNA: Well, that decides it. I'm not sitting in a traffic jam. I'm going
left.

**[Fortune Teller's tent]**

DONNA [OC]: I'm going left. Left. Left.  
(Donna screams. Key events rewind, then the beetle drops from her back.)  
DONNA: What the hell is that?  
FORTUNE TELLER: You were so strong. What are you? What will you be? What will
you be?  
(The fortune teller runs out the back of the tent. The Doctor enters.)  
DOCTOR: Everything all right?  
DONNA: Oh, God.  
(Donna hugs the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: What was that for?  
DONNA: I don't know.  
(Later, the Doctor is prodding the dead beetle with a stick.)  
DONNA: I can't remember. It's slipping away. You know like when you try and
think of a dream and it just sort of goes.  
DOCTOR: Just got lucky, this thing. It's one of the Trickster's Brigade.
Changes a life in tiny little ways. Most times, the universe just compensates
around it, but with you? Great big parallel world.  
DONNA: Hold on. You said parallel worlds are sealed off.  
DOCTOR: They are. But you had one created around you. Funny thing is, seems to
be happening a lot to you.  
DONNA: How do you mean?  
DOCTOR: Well, The Library and then this.  
DONNA: Just goes with the job, I suppose.  
DOCTOR: Sometimes I think there's way too much coincidence around you, Donna.
I met you once, then I met your grandfather, then I met you again. In the
whole wide universe, I met you for a second time. It's like something's
binding us together.  
DONNA: Don't be so daft. I'm nothing special.  
DOCTOR: Yes, you are. You're brilliant.  
ROSE [OC]: He thought you were brilliant.  
DONNA: She said that.  
DOCTOR: Who did?  
DONNA: That woman. I can't remember.  
DOCTOR: Well, she never existed now.  
DONNA: No, but she said the stars. She said the stars are going out.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, but that world's gone.  
DONNA: No, but she said it was all worlds. Every world. She said the darkness
is coming even here.  
DOCTOR: Who was she?  
DONNA: I don't know.  
DOCTOR: What did she look like?  
DONNA: She was blonde.  
DOCTOR: What was her name?  
DONNA: I don't know.  
DOCTOR: Donna, what was her name?  
DONNA: But she told me to warn you. She said two words.  
DOCTOR: What two words? What were they? What did she say?  
DONNA: Bad Wolf. Well, what does it mean?  
(The Doctor runs outside. Every printed thing now says Bad Wolf. Even the
Tardis says Bad Wolf instead of Police Box.)

**[Tardis]**

(The inside is lit by red emergency lighting, and the cloister bell tolls.)  
DONNA: Doctor, what is it? What's Bad Wolf?  
DOCTOR: It's the end of the universe.
