**The Stolen Earth**  
  
Original Airdate: 28 Jun, 2008  

**[Street]**

(The Tardis lands on the grass verge of a suburban street.)  
DOCTOR: It's fine. Everything's fine. Nothing's wrong, all fine. Excuse me.
What day is it?  
MILKMAN: Saturday.  
DOCTOR: Saturday. Good. Good, I like Saturdays.  
DONNA: So, I just met Rose Tyler?  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
DONNA: But she's locked away in a parallel world.  
DOCTOR: Exactly. If she can cross from her parallel world to your parallel
world, than that means the walls of the universe are breaking down, which puts
everything in danger. Everything. But how?  
(The Doctor and Donna go back into the Tardis. The bottles on the milk float
start to shake alarmingly, and tiles fall off roofs.)

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: The thing is, Doctor, no matter what's happening, and I'm sure it's
bad, I get that but, Rose is coming back. Isn't that good?  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
(Bang! The Tardis shakes.)  
DONNA: What the hell was that?  
DOCTOR: Don't know. It came from outside.  
(The Doctor opens the doors. There are just a few pieces of space rock
floating nearby.)  
DONNA: But we're in space. How did that happen? What did you do?  
(The Doctor checks the scanner readings.)  
DOCTOR: We haven't moved. We're fixed. It can't have. No. The Tardis is still
in the same place, but the Earth has gone. The entire planet. It's gone.

**[UNIT New York]**

(Far across the universe, according to the caption, Martha Jones is lying on
the upper floor of a skyscraper while sparks and smoke go on around her.)  
MAN [OC]: Give me a Sit Rep right now. Confirm all stations still online. Can
anyone hear me? Have we got contact with UNIT base Geneva?  
MARTHA: What was that?  
WOMAN [OC]: Emergency systems online.  
MARTHA: Was it some sort of earthquake, or? Jalandra, you all right?  
WOMAN [OC]: Start the back up generators. Get the unisystem operational. Come
on, do it fast.  
(A man answers Martha.)  
JALANDRA: Yeah, I'm okay.  
MARTHA: Is anyone hurt? We've lost power. Someone get the lights back on.
DaCosta, see to it right now. Suzanne? Are you okay?  
(Suzanne is staring out of a window.)  
SUZANNE: Martha, look at the sky.  
MARTHA: Why, what is it?  
SUZANNE: Just look at the sky.

**[Torchwood]**

(A tremor has throws the furniture around in Cardiff, too.)  
JACK: Whoa, what happened? Was it the Rift? Gwen? Ianto? You okay?  
IANTO: No broken bones. Slight loss of dignity. No change there then.  
GWEN: The whole of the city must've felt that. The whole of South Wales.  
JACK: I'm going to take a look outside.  
(Jack runs out while Ianto activates a computer screen.)  
IANTO: A little bit bigger than South Wales.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

(Ealing, London.)  
SARAH: Luke, are you all right?  
LUKE: Felt like some sort of cross-dimensional spatial transference.  
SARAH: But it's night. It wasn't night. It was eight o'clock in the morning.
Mister Smith, I need you.  
(A brick fireplace transforms into a computer.)  
SARAH: Can you just stop giving that fanfare? You just tell me what happened.  
MR SMITH: Sarah Jane, I think you should look outside. I think you'll find the
visual evidence most conclusive.

**[Outside the Nobles' home]**

WILF: It's gone dark. It's them aliens, I'll bet my pension. What do you want
this time, you green swine?  
(He brandishes his cricket bat.)  
SYLVIA: Dad.  
WILF: Look, you get back inside, Sylvia. They always want the women.  
SYLVIA: No, Dad, just look. Oh, my God. Look at the sky.

**[Outside Sarah Jane's house]**

SARAH: That's impossible.

**[Roald Dahl Plass]**

JACK: That's just impossible.

**[UNIT New York]**

MARTHA: It can't be.

**[Street]**

(The milkman turns around to see a blonde woman toting a honking great weapon
pop into existence. She looks up.)  
ROSE: Right, now we're in trouble.  
(She powers up the gun.)  
ROSE: It's only just beginning.  
(Instead of distant stars, the sky is filled with other planets in close
proximity.)

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: But if the Earth's been moved, they've lost the Sun. What about my Mum?
And Granddad? They're dead, aren't they? Are they dead?  
DOCTOR: I don't know, Donna. I just don't know. I'm sorry, I don't know.  
DONNA: That's my family. My whole world.  
DOCTOR: There's no readings. Nothing. Not a trace. Not even a whisper. Oh,
that is fearsome technology.  
DONNA: So what do we do?  
DOCTOR: We've got to get help.  
DONNA: From where?  
DOCTOR: Donna, I'm taking you to the Shadow Proclamation. Hold tight.

**[Torchwood]**

AMNN [on TV]: The United Nations has issued an edict, asking the citizens of
the world not to panic. So far, there has been no explanation of the twenty
six planets which have appeared in the sky  
RICHARD DAWKINS [on TV]: But it's an empirical fact. The planets didn't come
to us, we came to them. Just look at the stars. We're in a completely
different region of space. We've travelled.  
PAUL O'GRADY [on TV]: do you know what, I look up and there's all these moons
and things. Have you seen them? Did you see them?  
AUDIENCE [on TV]: Yeah!  
PAUL O'GRADY [on TV]: I thought, what was I drinking last night, furniture
polish?  
(Ianto laughs with the studio audience.)  
JACK: Ianto. Time and a place.  
IANTO: He is funny, though.  
JACK: Gwen, come and see.  
(Gwen is phoning her other half.)  
GWEN: Rhys, I have no idea. Just stay indoors. And can you phone my mother?
Tell her, er, oh, I don't know. Just tell her to take her pills and go to
sleep. I'm going to come home as soon as I can, I promise. I love you, you big
idiot.  
JACK: Someone's established an artificial atmospheric shell, keeping the air
and holding in the heat.  
IANTO: Whoever's done this wants the human race alive. That's a plus. Twenty
seven planets, including the Earth.  
(As the planets on the scan move in their orbits, a flashing red dot appears
in the middle.)  
GWEN: No, but what's that? That's not a planet.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

MR SMITH: The reading seems to be artificial in construction.  
SARAH: Some sort of space station sitting at the heart of the web.  
LUKE: They're fine. Maria and her dad, they're still in Cornwall. I told them
to stay indoors. And Clyde's all right. He's with his mum.  
MR SMITH: Sarah Jane, I have detected movement. Observe.  
LUKE: Spaceships.

**[UNIT New York]**

(Army brass are taking control.)  
SANCHEZ: Tracking two hundred objects. Earthbound trajectory. Geneva is
calling a Code Red. Everyone to battle positions. Doctor Jones, if you're not
too busy.  
MARTHA: I'm trying to phone the Doctor, sir.  
SANCHEZ: And?  
MARTHA: There's no signal. This number calls anywhere in the universe. It
never breaks down. They must be blocking it, whoever they are.  
SANCHEZ: We're about to find out. They're coming into orbit.

**[London]**

(People are panicking and looting shops. Young men are driving their cars down
the pavements whilst drinking, heedless of the pedestrians in their way.)  
PASSENGER: Yeah, and you, mate!  
(Rose comes out of a subway.)  
DRUNK: The end of the world, darling. End of the stinking world.  
ROSE: Have one on me, mate.  
(Another shop window breaks and the alarm sounds. Rose goes over to see two
lads stealing computers and televisions.)

**[Shop]**

ROSE: Right, you two. You can put that stuff down or run for your lives. Do
you like my gun?  
(They run. She sits at a screen showing the red blobs approaching Earth.)

**[Nobles' home]**

BBC NEWS [on TV]: We're now getting confirmed reports of spaceships. The
Pentagon has issued an emergency report saying that two hundred objects  
SYLVIA: Dad? Come and see.  
BBC NEWS [on TV]: Are now heading towards Earth in a regular pattern.  
SYLVIA: They're saying spaceships. Did you find her?  
BBC NEWS [on TV]: Organised flightplan.  
WILF: No, no, there's no reply. Where are you, Donna?  
BBC NEWS [on TV]: And stay indoors.  
WILF: Where are you, sweetheart?

**[Torchwood]**

GWEN: Three thousand miles and closing. But who are they?.  
(Jack's mobile rings.)  
JACK: Martha Jones, voice of a nightingale. Tell me you put something in my
drink.

**[UNIT New York]**

MARTHA: No such luck. Have you heard from the Doctor?  
JACK [OC]: Not a word. Where are you?  
MARTHA: New York.

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: Ooo, nice for some.

**[UNIT New York]**

MARTHA: I've been promoted. Medical Director on Project Indigo.

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: Did you get that thing working?

**[Unit New York]**

MARTHA: Indigo's top secret.

**[Torchwood]**

MARTHA [OC]: No one's supposed to know about it.  
JACK: I met a soldier in a bar, long story.  
IANTO: When was that?  
JACK: Strictly professional.  
GWEN: Fifteen hundred miles, boys, and accelerating. They're almost here.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

MR SMITH: I'm receiving a communication from the earthbound ships. They have a
message for the human race.  
SARAH: Put it through, let's hear it.  
DALEK [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.

**[Torchwood]**

DALEK [OC]: Exterminate.

**[UNIT New York]**

DALEK [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate.

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: No.  
DALEK [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
JACK: Oh, no.  
GWEN: What is it? Who are they? Do you know them, Jack?  
(Jack pulls Ianto and Gwen close, and kisses them both.)  
DALEK [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

DALEK [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.  
SARAH: No.

**[Torchwood]**

DALEK [OC]: Exterminate.  
JACK: There's nothing I can do.  
DALEK [OC]: Exterminate.  
JACK: I'm sorry. We're dead.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

DALEK [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
SARAH: Oh God, you're so young.

**[Shop]**

DALEK [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.  
(Rose goes outside the shop, which is called Megabyte City, to see a massive
flying saucer pass overhead, firing at random. She walks away as a bolt takes
out a nearby shop.)

**[Crucible]**

(A mega-spaceship that looks more like an asteroid with engines.)  
DALEK: Dalek fleet in battle formation.  
DALEK 2: All systems locked and primed.  
DALEK 3: Crucible at ninety percent efficiency.  
DALEK 4: The human harvest will commence.

**[UNIT New York]**

SANCHEZ: Battle stations! Geneva declaring Ultimate Code Red. Ladies and
gentlemen, we are at war.  
(Blasts shake the building. Martha runs to a window to see the saucers
shooting at the skyscrapers.)

**[Crucible]**

DALEK: Supreme Dalek on the bridge.  
(The Red Dalek enters.)  
RED DALEK: Soon the Crucible will be complete. We have waited long for this
ultimate destiny. Now the Daleks are the masters of Earth.  
(We are shown lots of Daleks floating in the air.)  
DALEKS: Daleks are the masters of Earth. Daleks are the masters of Earth.

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: So go on then, what is the Shadow Proclamation anyway?  
DOCTOR: Posh name for police. Outer space police. Here we go.

**[Corridor]**

(The Tardis lands in an ordinary looking corridor somewhere in a complex built
on three linked asteroids. They are greeted by an armed platoon.)  
JUDOON: Sco bo tro no flo jo ko fo to to.  
DOCTOR: No bo ho sho ko ro to so. Bokodozogobofopojo.  
(The Judoon come to attention.)  
DOCTOR: Moho.

**[Shadow Proclamation]**

(A silver-haired woman in a black gown is pacing.)  
ARCHITECT: Time Lords are the stuff of legend. They belong in the myths and
whispers of the Higher Species. You cannot possibly exist.  
DOCTOR: Yeah. More to the point, I've got a missing planet.  
ARCHITECT: Then you're not as wise as the stories would say. The picture is
far bigger than you imagine. The whole universe is in outrage, Doctor. Twenty
four worlds have been taken from the sky.  
DOCTOR: How many?. Which ones? Show me.  
(He joins the woman at her computer screen.)  
ARCHITECT: Locations range far and wide, but all disappeared at the exact same
moment, leaving no trace.  
DOCTOR: Callufrax Minorr. Jahoo. Shallacatop. Woman Wept. Clom. Clom's gone?
Who'd want Clom?  
ARCHITECT: All different sizes. Some populated, some not. But all unconnected.  
DONNA: What about Pyrovillia?  
ARCHITECT: Who is the female?  
DONNA: Donna. I'm a human being. Maybe not the stuff of legend but every bit
as important as Time Lords, thank you. Way back, when we were in Pompeii,
Lucius said Pyrovillia had gone missing.  
JUDOON: Pyrovillia is cold case. Not relevant.  
DONNA: How do you mean, cold case?  
ARCHITECT: The planet Pyrovillia cannot be part of this. It disappeared over
two thousand years ago.  
DONNA: Yes, yes, hang on. But there's the Adipose breeding planet, too. Miss
Foster said that was lost, but that must've been a long time ago.  
DOCTOR: That's it! Donna, brilliant. Planets are being taken out of time as
well as space. Let's put this into 3-D.  
(Holograms of the missing planets start to fill the room.)  
DOCTOR: Now, if we add Pyrovillia and Adipose Three. Something missing. Where
else, where else, where else? Where else lost, lost, lost, lost. Oh! The Lost
Moon of Poosh.  
(With the last sphere added, the representations suddenly reorganise
themselves.)  
ARCHITECT: What did you do?  
DOCTOR: Nothing. The planets rearranged themselves into the optimum pattern.
Oh, look at that. Twenty seven planets in perfect balance. Come on, that is
gorgeous.  
DONNA: Oi, don't get all spaceman. What does it mean?  
DOCTOR: All those worlds fit together like pieces of an engine. It's like a
powerhouse. What for?  
ARCHITECT: Who could design such a thing?  
DOCTOR: Someone tried to move the Earth once before. Long time ago. Can't be.

**[Earth orbit]**

(Flying Daleks attack the Valiant.)  
DALEKS: Maximum extermination.

**[Torchwood]**

CAPTAIN [OC]: The shields are down. There's too many of them. Abandon ship.  
JACK: The Valiant's down!  
IANTO: Air force retreating over North Africa. Daleks landing in Japan.  
GWEN: We've lost contact with the Prime Minister's plane. Jack! Manhattan.  
JACK: Martha, get out of there.

**[UNIT New York]**

(Martha is bandaging a wounded man's head.)  
MARTHA: I can't, Jack. I've got a job to do.

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: They're targeting military bases

**[UNIT New York]**

JACK [OC]: And you're next on the list.  
SANCHEZ: Doctor Jones, you will come with me. Project Indigo is being
activated. Quick march.

**[Passageway]**

MARTHA: But we can't use Project Indigo. It hasn't been tested, sir. We don't
even know if it works.

**[UNIT New York]**

DALEK: UNIT forces will be exterminated.  
DALEK 3: Annihilate UNIT.  
(The battle is joined.)  
DALEK: Exterminate.

**[Storage area]**

(A UNIT soldier opens a storage unit to reveal a backpack with a keypad on
it.)  
SANCHEZ: Put it on. Fast as you can.  
JACK [OC]: Martha, I'm telling you.

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: Don't use Project Indigo. It's not safe.

**[Storage area]**

SANCHEZ: You take your orders from UNIT, Doctor Jones. Not from Torchwood.  
(Martha puts on the backpack.)  
MARTHA: But why me?  
SANCHEZ: You're our only hope of finding the Doctor. But failing that, if no
help is coming, then with the power invested in me by the Unified Intelligence
Taskforce, I authorise you to take this. The Osterhagen Key.  
(A computer chip.)  
MARTHA: I can't take that, sir.  
SANCHEZ: You know what to do, for the sake of the human race.  
(Martha takes it as the building shakes.)  
DALEK [OC]: Daleks one five reaching north corridor.  
DALEK 3 [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
SANCHEZ: Doctor Jones, good luck.  
DALEKS [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.  
(The General and the soldier face the Daleks.)  
DALEK 3: Exterminate.  
MARTHA: Bye, Jack.

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: Martha, don't do it.  
(Martha pulls two ripcords on the backpack and vanishes in a bright light as
the General and the soldier die.)  
JACK: Don't!  
IANTO: What's Project Indigo?  
JACK: Experimental teleport salvaged from the Sontarans. But they haven't got
coordinates, or stabilisation.  
GWEN: So where is she?  
JACK: Scattered into atoms. Martha's down.

**[Crucible** **]**

RED DALEK: Commence the landings. Bring the humans here. Prepare the Crucible.  
DAVROS [OC]: Supreme Dalek, is there news?  
RED DALEK: Earth has been subjugated.

**[Vault** **]**

(A humanoid figure in a Dalek style wheelchair moves forward out of the
shadows. This area is only named in the next episode, but for the sake of
consistency I'll use it here too.)  
DAVROS: I mean, is there news of him?  
RED DALEK [on screen]: Negative. No reports of Time Lord. We are beyond the
Doctor's reach.  
DAVROS: Fascinating. If I had not elevated you beyond crude emotions, I could
almost mistake that tone for one of victory. Beware your pride.  
RED DALEK [on screen]: The Doctor cannot stop us.  
DAVROS: And yet, Dalek Caan is uneasy.  
(Davros flicks a switch to light up the chained remains of a Dalek casing
containing an active mutant.)

**[Crucible** **]**

RED DALEK: The abomination

**[Vault** **]**

RED DALEK [on screen]: Is insane.  
DAVROS: Show respect. Without Dalek Caan, none of this would be possible. And
he speaks only the truth.  
CAAN: He is coming, the threefold man. He dances in the lonely places. Oh,
creator of us all, the Doctor is coming. Tee hee hee hee

**[Shadow Proclamation]**

(Donna is sitting on the stairs while the Architect and the Doctor confer. She
hears a heartbeat pounding. A white-haired, pink eyed young woman offers a
tray.)  
ALBINO: You need sustenance. Take the water, it purifies.  
DONNA: Thanks.  
ALBINO: There was something on your back.  
DONNA: How do you know that?  
ALBINO: You are something new.  
DONNA: Not me. I'm just a temp. Shorthand, filing, hundred words per minute.
Fat lot of good that is now. I'm no use to anyone.  
ALBINO: I'm so sorry for your loss.  
DONNA: Yeah. My whole planet's gone.  
ALBINO: I mean the loss that is yet to come. God save you.  
(The servant goes up the stairs. The Doctor walks over to Donna.)  
DOCTOR: Donna, come on, think. Earth. There must've been some sort of warning.
Was anything happening back in your day, like electrical storms, freak
weather, patterns in the sky?  
DONNA: Well, how should I know? Er, no. I don't think so, no.  
DOCTOR: Oh, okay, never mind.  
DONNA: Although, there were the bees disappearing.  
DOCTOR: The bees disappearing. The bees disappearing. The bees disappearing!  
ARCHITECT: How is that significant?  
DONNA: On Earth we had these insects. Some people said it was pollution or
mobile phone signals.  
DOCTOR: Or, they were going back home.  
DONNA: Back home where?  
DOCTOR: Planet Melissa Majoria.  
DONNA: Are you saying bees are aliens?.  
DOCTOR: Don't be so daft. Not all of them. But if the migrant bees felt
something coming, some sort of danger, and escaped? Tandocca.  
ARCHITECT: The Tandocca Scale.  
DOCTOR: Tandocca Scale is the series of wavelengths used as a carrier signals
by migrant bees. Infinitely small. No wonder we didn't see it. It's like
looking for a speck of cinnamon in the Sahara, but look, there it is. The
Tandocca trail. The transmat that moved the planets was using the same
wavelength, we can follow the path.  
DONNA: And find the Earth?. Well, stop talking and do it.  
DOCTOR: I am.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: We're a bit late. The signal's scattered, but it's a start.  
(The Doctor puts his head out of the Tardis door.)  
DOCTOR: I've got a blip. It's just a blip, But it's definitely a blip.  
ARCHITECT: Then according to the Strictures of the Shadow Proclamation, I will
have to seize your transport and your technology.  
DOCTOR: Oh, really? What for?  
ARCHITECT: The planets were stolen with hostile intent. We are declaring war,
Doctor, right across the universe, and you will lead us into battle.  
DOCTOR: Right. Yes. Course I will. I'll just go and get you the key.

**[Corridor]**

(The Tardis dematerialises.  
ARCHITECT: Doctor, come back! By the Holy Writ of the Shadow Proclamation, I
order you to stop!

**[Street]**

DALEK: All humans will leave their homes. The males, the females, the
descendants. You will come with us. Resistance is useless.  
MAN: Where are you taking us?  
DALEK: Daleks do not answer human questions. Stand in line.  
(Wilf and Sylvia are watching from the corner.)  
SYLVIA: Dad, please, come home. They're leaving our street alone.  
WILF: Yeah, I've got a weapon.  
SYLVIA: It's a paint gun.  
WILF: Exactly. Them Dalek things, they've only got one eye. A good splodge of
paint, they'd be blinded.  
(PC Tom Campbell from Dalek Invasion Earth 2150, we're proud of you.)  
MAN: We're not going. Do you hear me? Laura, get back inside the house. Simon,
get inside. Go!  
(The man picks up a house brick and throws it at the Dalek.)  
MAN: Get back in the sky.  
(Clang as the brick bounces off the Dalek.)  
MAN: Get back where you came from and leave us alone.  
(He joins his wife and son inside their home.)  
DALEK: Dalek attack formation seven. Maximum extermination.  
(Three Daleks fire at the terraced house and it goes up in a fireball.)  
WILF: They're monsters.  
SYLVIA: Please, Dad. Come home.  
(They leave, and run into a lone Dalek.)  
DALEK: Halt. You will come with me.  
WILF: Will I heck.  
(He fires a splodge of yellow paint right onto the eyestalk. After a moment,
it is boiled off.)  
DALEK: My vision is not impaired.  
SYLVIA: I warned you, Dad.  
DALEK: Hostility will not be tolerated. Exterminate. Exterminate. Exter  
(The Dalek's head explodes. Rose is standing behind it holding a honking big
gun.)  
WILF: Do you want to swap?  
ROSE: You're Donna Noble's family, right? I'm Rose Tyler, and I need you.

**[Nobles' home]**

WILF: Yeah, I've tried calling her, but I can't get through. But she's still
with the Doctor, I know that much, and the last time she phoned, it was from a
planet called Midnight, made of diamonds.  
SYLVIA: What the hell are you two on about?  
WILF: Look, she's out there, sweetheart. Your daughter. She's travelling the
stars with that Doctor. She always has been.  
SYLVIA: Don't be ridiculous.  
WILF: Oh, come on, open your eyes. Look at the sky. Look at, look at the
Daleks. You can't start denying things now.  
ROSE: You're my last hope. If we can't find Donna, can't find the Doctor.
Where is he?.

**[Tardis]**

(The time rotor stops wheezing.)  
DOCTOR: It's stopped.  
DONNA: What do you mean? Is that good or bad? Where are we?  
DOCTOR: The Medusa Cascade. I came here when I was just a kid, ninety years
old. It was the centre of a rift in time and space.  
(It is a multi-coloured nebula.)  
DONNA: So, where are the twenty seven planets?  
DOCTOR: Nowhere. The Tandocca Trail stops dead. End of the line.  
DONNA: So what do we do? Doctor, what do we do? Now don't do this to me. No,
don't. Don't do this to me. Not now. Tell me, what are we going do? You never
give up. Please.

**[Torchwood]**

(Everyone is just sitting, listening.)  
COMMANDER GENERAL [OC]: This is the Commander General of the United Nations
calling the Dalek Fleet. We surrender. Repeat, we surrender. Planet Earth
surrenders.  
DALEK [OC]: Humans selected for testing will follow Dalek instructions.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

DALEK [OC]: The Daleks reign supreme. All hail the Daleks.

**[Nobles' home]**

DALEK [OC]: You will obey Dalek instructions without question. You will obey
your Dalek ma  
(Beep, beep, beep, beep. Beep, beep, beep, beep.)  
HARRIET [OC]: Can anyone hear me? The Subwave Network is open. You should be
able to hear my voice Is there anyone there?  
(A static ridden picture comes on the laptop screen.)  
ROSE: I know that voice.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

LUKE: Who's that?  
SARAH: Some poor soul calling for help.  
HARRIET [OC]: Can anyone hear me?  
SARAH: There's nothing we can do.  
LUKE: But look at Mister Smith.  
MR SMITH: Processing incoming Subwave.

**[Torchwood]**

HARRIET [OC]: This message is of the utmost importance. We haven't much time.
Can anyone hear me?  
GWEN: Someone's trying to get in touch.  
JACK: The whole world's crying out. Just leave it.  
(The image starts to resolve into colour.)  
HARRIET [on screen]: Captain Jack Harkness, shame on you. Now stand to
attention, sir.  
JACK: What? Who is that?  
(Harriet holds up her ID.)  
HARRIET [on screen]: Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister.  
JACK: Yeah, I know who you are.

**[Nobles' home]**

(Jack's voice is in the background of Harriet's image.)  
ROSE: Harriet, it's me. It's me. Oh, she can't hear me. Have you got a webcam?  
WILF: No, she wouldn't let me. She said they're naughty.  
ROSE: I can't speak to her then, can I?

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: Sarah Jane Smith, 13 Bannerman Road.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

HARRIET [on screen]: Are you there?  
SARAH: Yeah. Yeah, I'm here. That, that's me.  
HARRIET [on screen]: Good. Now

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: Let's see if we can talk to each other.  
(Three images come up on the four quarters of the screen - Harriet, Jack,
Sarah and Luke and static.)  
HARRIET: The fourth contact seems to be having some trouble getting through.

**[Nobles' home]**

ROSE: That's me. Harriet, that's me.  
HARRIET [OC]: I'll just boost the signal.  
MARTHA [on screen]: Hello?

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: Ha, ha! Martha Jones.

**[Nobles' home]**

ROSE: Who's she? I want to get through.  
JACK [on screen]: Martha, where are you?.  
MARTHA [on screen]: I guess Project Indigo was more clever

**[Francine's home]**

MARTHA: Than we thought. One second I was in Manhattan, next second. Maybe
Indigo tapped into my mind, because I ended up in the one place that I wanted
to be.  
(Lying on the floor by the front door.)  
MARTHA [memory]: Mum?  
FRANCINE: You came home. At the end of the world, you came back to me.  
MARTHA: But then all of a sudden, it's like the laptop turned itself on.  
HARRIET [on screen]: It did.

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: That was me.

**[Francine's home]**

HARRIET [on screen]: Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister.  
MARTHA: Yes, I know who you are.  
HARRIET [on screen]: I thought it was about time we all met

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

HARRIET [on screen]: Given the current crisis. Torchwood, this is Sarah Jane
Smith.  
JACK [on screen]: I've been following your work. Nice job with the Slitheen.  
SARAH: Yeah, well, I've been staying away from you lot. Too many guns.  
(She nods towards young Luke.)  
JACK [on screen]: All the same, might I say looking good, ma'am?  
SARAH: Really? Ooo.

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: Not now, Captain. And Martha Jones

**[Nobles' home]**

HARRIET [on screen]: Former companion to the Doctor.  
ROSE: Oi. So was I.

**[Francine's home]**

MARTHA: But how did you find me?  
HARRIET [on screen]: This, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Subwave Network.

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: A sentient piece of software programmed to seek out anyone and
everyone who can help to contact the Doctor.

**[Francine's home]**

MARTHA: What if the Daleks can hear us?

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: No, that's the beauty of the Subwave. It's undetectable.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

SARAH: And you invented it?  
HARRIET [on screen]: I developed it.

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: It was created by the Mister Copper Foundation.  
JACK [on screen]: Yeah, but what we need right now is a weapon.

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: Martha, back there at UNIT, what, what did they

**[Francine's home]**

JACK [on screen]: Give you? What was that key thing?  
MARTHA: The Osterhagen key.

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: That key is not to be used, Doctor Jones. Not under any
circumstances.

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: But what is an Osterhagen key?

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: Forget about the key, and that's an order.

**[Francine's home]**

HARRIET [on screen]: All we need is the Doctor.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

SARAH: Only, excuse me, Harriet, but. Well, the thing is, if you're looking
for the Doctor, didn't he depose you?

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: He did. And I've wondered about that for a long time, whether I was
wrong. But I stand by my actions to this day, because I knew, I knew

**[Francine's home]**

HARRIET [on screen]: That one day, the Earth would be in danger, and the
Doctor would fail to appear.

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: I told him so myself, and he didn't listen.

**[Francine's home]**

MARTHA: But I've been trying to find him. The Doctor's got my phone on the
Tardis, but I can't get through.

**[Nobles' home]**

ROSE: Nor me, and I was here first.  
HARRIET [on screen]: That's why we need the Subwave. To bring us all together.

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: Combine forces. The Doctor's secret

**[Torchwood]**

HARRIET [on screen]: Army.  
JACK: Wait a minute. We boost the signal. That's it. We transmit that
telephone number through Torchwood itself, using all the power of the Rift.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

LUKE: And we've got Mister Smith.

**[Torchwood]**

LUKE [on screen]: He can link up with every telephone exchange on the Earth.

**[Francine's home]**

LUKE [on screen]: He can get the whole world to call the same number, all at
the same time.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

LUKE: Billions of phones, calling out all at once.

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: Brilliant. Who's the kid?  
SARAH [on screen]: That's my son.  
IANTO: Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Hello. Ianto Jones. Er, if we start

**[Harriet's home]**

IANTO [on screen]: Transmitting, then this Subwave Network is going to become
visible. I mean, to the Daleks.  
HARRIET: Yes, and they'll trace it back to me. But my life doesn't matter. Not
if it saves the Earth.

**[Torchwood]**

(Jack salutes.)  
JACK: Ma'am.  
HARRIET [on screen]: Thank you, Captain.

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: But there are people out there dying on the streets.

**[Nobles' home]**

WILF: Marvellous woman. I voted for her.  
SYLVIA: You did not.

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: Now, enough of words. Let's begin.

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: Rift power activated.  
GWEN: All terminals coordinated.  
(Ianto plugs in a big power cable.)  
IANTO: National grid online. Giving you everything we've got.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

SARAH: Connecting you to Mister Smith.  
LUKE: All telephone networks combined.

**[Francine's home]**

MARTHA: Sending you the number now.  
(Calling 07700 900461)

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: Opening Subwave Network to maximum.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

SARAH: Mister Smith, make that call.  
MR SMITH: Calling the Doctor.

**[Nobles' home]**

ROSE: So am I.

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: And sending.  
(Circles of energy pulse out from the ornamental waterfall in Roald Dahl
Plass.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Phone!  
DONNA: Doctor, phone.  
DOCTOR: Martha, is that you?. It's a signal.  
DONNA: Can we follow it?  
(The Doctor dons his stethoscope.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, just watch me.

**[Crucible** **]**

DALEK: Emergency. Unknown network detected. Subwave frequency.  
RED DALEK: Find the point of origin. Find and exterminate.  
DAVROS [OC]: I warned you, Supreme One.

**[Vault** **]**

DAVROS: Just as Dalek Caan foretold. The Children of Time are moving against
us. But everything is falling into place.

**[Torchwood]**

(Things are going Bang! with the energy overload.)  
JACK: I think we've got a fix.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

SARAH: Mister Smith now at two hundred per cent.  
(Bang! Sparks.)  
SARAH: Oh, come on, Doctor.

**[Nobles' home]**

(Rose, Wilf and Sylvia are using their mobile phones too.)  
ROSE: (sotto) Find me, Doctor. Find me.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Got it. Locking on.

**[Torchwood]**

GWEN: Harriet, a saucer's locked on to your location. They've found you.  
HARRIET [on screen]: I know. I'm using

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: The Network to mask your transmission. Keep going.  
DALEK [OC]: Exterminate.  
(The curtains blow in from an explosion.)

**[Tardis]**

(Bangs and flames here, too.)  
DOCTOR: We're travelling through time. One second in the future. The phone
call's pulling us through.

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: Captain, I'm transferring the Subwave Network to Torchwood. You're in
charge now. And tell the Doctor from me

**[Torchwood]**

HARRIET [on screen]: He chose his companions well.

**[Harriet's home]**

HARRIET: It's been an honour.  
(Harriet gets up to face the three Daleks who have smashed their way in, and
shows her ID.)  
HARRIET: Harriet Jones. Former Prime Minister.  
DALEK: Yes, we know who you are.  
HARRIET: Oh, you know nothing of any human, and that will be your downfall.  
DALEK: Exterminate.  
(The first quarter of the screen dissolves into static.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Three, two, one.  
(The Doctor and Donna scream as the planets pop into existence around them.
The Tardis stops shaking.)  
DONNA: Twenty seven planets. And there's the Earth. But why couldn't we see
them?  
DOCTOR: The entire Medusa Cascade has been put a second out of sync with the
rest of the universe. Perfect hiding place. Tiny little pocket of time. But we
found them. Ooo, ooo, ooo, what's that? Hold on, hold on. Some sort of Subwave
Network.  
(The Doctor and Donna take Harriet's quarter of the screen.)  
JACK [on screen]: Where the hell have you been?

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: Doctor, it's the Daleks.  
GWEN: Oh, he's a bit nice. I thought he'd be older.  
IANTO: He's not that young.

**[Tardis]**

SARAH [on screen]: It's the Daleks. They're taking people to their spaceship.  
MARTHA: It's not just Dalek Caan.

**[Nobles' home]**

SYLVIA: It's Donna!  
WILF: That's my girl.  
JACK [on screen]: Surrendered.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Sarah Jane. Who's that boy? That must be Torchwood. Oh, they're
brilliant.

**[Nobles' home]**

DOCTOR [on screen]: Look at you all, you clever people.

**[Francine's home]**

DONNA [on screen]: That's Martha.

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: And who's he?  
DOCTOR: Captain Jack. Don't. Just don't.

**[Nobles' home]**

ROSE: Doctor, it's me, I came back.

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: It's like an outer space Facebook.  
DOCTOR: Everyone except Rose.

**[Vault** **]**

CAAN: Tee hee, hee. He is here. The Dark Lord is come.  
DAVROS: Supreme One, this Subwave Network, I would address it. Give me access.

**[Tardis]**

(The scanner goes blank.)  
DOCTOR: Oh.  
DONNA: We've lost them.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. There's another signal coming through. There's
someone else out there. Hello? Can you hear me? Rose?  
DAVROS [OC]: Your voice is different, and yet its arrogance is unchanged.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

SARAH: No. But he's dead.

**[Vault** **]**

DAVROS: Welcome to my new Empire

**[Tardis]**

DAVROS [on screen]: Doctor. It is only fitting that you should bear witness to
the resurrection and the triumph

**[Vault** **]**

DAVROS: Of Davros, lord and creator of the Dalek race.

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: Doctor?  
DAVROS [on screen]: Have you nothing to say?  
DONNA: Doctor, it's all right. We're, we're in the Tardis. We're safe.  
DOCTOR: But you were destroyed. In the very first year of the Time War, at the
Gates of Elysium.

**[Vault** **]**

DOCTOR [on screen]: I saw your command ship fly into the jaws of the Nightmare
Child.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: I tried to save you.  
DAVROS [on screen]: But it took one stronger than you.

**[Vault** **]**

DAVROS: Dalek Caan himself.  
CAAN: I flew into the wild and fire. I danced and died a thousand times.  
DAVROS: Emergency Temporal Shift took him back into the Time War itself.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: But that's impossible. The entire War is timelocked.

**[Vault** **]**

DAVROS: And yet he succeeded. Oh, it cost him his mind, but imagine. A single,
simple Dalek succeeded where Emperors and Time Lords have failed. A testament,
don't you think, to my remarkable creations?

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: And you made a new race of Daleks.

**[Vault** **]**

DAVROS: I gave myself to them, quite literally. Each one grown from a cell of
my own body.  
(Davros opens his tunic to reveal his bare ribs with just a few nerve endings
over them, and his internal organs inside.)  
DAVROS: New Daleks.

**[Tardis]**

DAVROS [on screen]: True Daleks. I have my children, Doctor. What do you have,
now?  
DOCTOR: After all this time, everything we saw, everything we lost, I have
only one thing to say to you. Bye!  
(He throws a lever and the Tardis flies off.)

**[Crucible** **]**

RED DALEK: Emergency. Locate the Tardis. Find the Doctor.

**[Vault** **]**

DAVROS: He will go to the Earth to find his precious Human allies.  
CAAN: And death is coming. Oh, I can see it. Everlasting death for the most
faithful companion.

**[Crucible** **]**

DALEK: Subwave Network rerouted. New location, Torchwood.  
RED DALEK: Then exterminate them at once. Exterminate Torchwood.

**[Torchwood]**

IANTO: Gwen, Dalek saucer heading for the Bay. They've found us.  
JACK: Martha, open that Indigo device. Now listen to me. Lift the central
panel. There's a string of numbers that keep changing

**[Francine's home]**

JACK [on phone]: But the fourth number keeps oscillating between two different
digits. Tell me what they are.  
MARTHA: It's a four and a nine. We could never work out what that was.

**[Torchwood]**

JACK: Yeah, that's the teleport base code. And that's all I need, to get this
thing working again.  
(Jack activates his wrist teleport.)  
JACK: Oscillating four and nine. Thank you, Martha Jones.  
(Gwen gives Jack a big weapon.)  
JACK: I've got to go. I've got to find the Doctor. I'll come back. I'm coming
back.  
GWEN: Don't worry about us. Just go.  
IANTO: We'll be fine.  
JACK: You'd better be.  
(Jack vanishes. Boom! Rubble falls from the ceiling.)  
DALEK [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
GWEN: They're here.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

MR SMITH: Tardis heading for vector seven. Grid reference six six five.  
(Sarah runs for the door.)  
LUKE: But there are Daleks out there.  
SARAH: I know,. I'm sorry, but I have got to find the Doctor. Don't move.
Don't leave the house. Don't do anything.  
MR SMITH: I will protect the boy, Sarah Jane.  
SARAH: I love you. Remember that.  
(Sarah runs out to her car and drives off.)

**[Nobles' home]**

(Rose has collected her gun and is making a phone call.)  
ROSE: Control, I need another shift. Lock me onto the Tardis, now. Right, I'm
going to find him. Wish me luck.  
SYLVIA: Oh, good luck.  
WILF: Yeah, good luck, sweetheart.  
(Rose vanishes in a blinding flash.)

**[Outside the church]**

(The one where Donna was supposed to get married?)  
DONNA: Like a ghost town.  
DOCTOR: Sarah Jane said they were taking the people. What for? Think, Donna.
When you met Rose in that parallel world, what did she say?  
DONNA: Just, the darkness is coming.  
DOCTOR: Anything else?  
DONNA: Why don't you ask her yourself?  
(Rose is walking down the street towards them. The Doctor runs to her.)  
DALEK: Exterminate.  
(The Dalek's ray grazes the Doctor, but still lights him up and knocks him
down. Jack appears and blasts the Dalek. Rose gets to the Doctor first.)  
ROSE: I've got you. It missed you. Look, it's me, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Rose.  
ROSE: Hi.  
DOCTOR: Long time no see.  
ROSE: Yeah. Been busy, you know. Don't die. Oh, my God. Don't die. Oh my god,
don't die.  
JACK: Get him into the Tardis, quick. Move.

**[Torchwood]**

(Gwen fetches machine guns.)  
IANTO: But they don't work against Daleks.  
GWEN: Yeah? Well, I'm going out fighting. Like Owen, like Tosh. How about you?  
DALEK [OC]: Exterminate.  
IANTO: Yes, ma'am.  
DALEKS: Exterminate.

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: What, what do we do?. There must be some medicine or something.  
JACK: Just step back. Rose, do as I say, and get back. He's dying and you know
what happens next.  
DONNA: What do you mean? He can't.  
ROSE: Oh, no. I came all this way.  
DONNA: What do you mean, what happens next?  
(The Doctor right hand begins to glow.)  
DOCTOR: It's starting.

**[Sarah Jane's car]**

(Sarah screeches to a halt behind two Daleks. They turn around slowly.)  
DALEK: All human transport is forbidden.  
SARAH: I surrender. I'm sorry!  
DALEK: Daleks do not accept apologies. You will be exterminated.  
DALEK 2: Exterminate.  
DALEK: Exterminate.

**[Torchwood]**

DALEK: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
(Gwen and Ianto open fire.)

**[Tardis]**

JACK: Here we go. Good luck, Doctor.  
DONNA: Will someone please tell me what is going on?.  
ROSE: When he's dying, his er, his body, it repairs itself. It changes. But
you can't!  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, it's too late. I'm regenerating.
