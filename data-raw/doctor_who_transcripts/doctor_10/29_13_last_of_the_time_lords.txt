closed.

_One year later_

**[Beach]**

(A man signals to a rowing boat offshore with an oil lamp. It comes in and
Martha gets out. The boat and its crew leave.)  
MARTHA: What's your name, then?  
TOM: Tom Milligan. No need to ask who you are. The famous Martha Jones. How
long since you were last in Britain?  
MARTHA: Three hundred and sixty five days. It's been a long year.  
TOM: So what's the plan?  
MARTHA: This Professor Docherty. I need to see her. Can you get me there?  
TOM: She works in a repair shed, Nuclear Plant Seven. I can get you inside.
What's all this for? What's so important about her?  
MARTHA: Sorry, the more you know, the more you're at risk.  
TOM: There's a lot of people depending on you. You're a bit of a legend.  
MARTHA: What does the legend say?  
TOM: That you sailed the Atlantic, walked across America. That you were the
only person to get out of Japan alive. Martha Jones, they say, she's going to
save the world. Bit late for that.  
(They walk up to a flat bed van.)  
MARTHA: How come you can drive? Don't you get stopped?  
TOM: Medical staff. Used to be in paediatrics back in the old days. But that
gives me a licence to travel so I can help out other the labour camps.  
MARTHA: Great. I'm travelling with a doctor.

**[Van cab]**

TOM: Story goes that you're the only person on Earth who can kill him. That
you, and you alone, can kill the Master stone dead.  
MARTHA: Let's just drive.

**[Flight deck]**

MASTER [OC]: Citizens rejoice. Your lord and master stands on high, playing
track three.  
(The Master enters the flight deck and starts dancing to I Can't Decide by
Scissor Sisters. He goes up to Lucy, kisses her and they dance together.)  
SINGER: I can't decide whether you should live or die. Though you'll probably
go to Heaven, please don't hang your head and cry. No wonder why my heart
feels dead inside. It's cold and hard and petrified. Lock the doors and close
the blinds, we're going for a ride. Oh, I could throw you in a lake or feed
you poisoned birthday cake. I won't deny I'm going to miss you when you're
gone.  
(Francine the maid serves tea. The Master rings a ships bell and the Doctor
crawls out of his straw-strewn tent. The Master forces him into a wheelchair
and takes him for a push around the deck.)  
SINGER: Oh, I could bury you alive but you might crawl out with a knife and
kill me when I'm sleeping, that's why I can't decide whether you should live
or die. Oh you'll probably go to Heaven, please don't hang your head and cry.
No wonder why my heart feels dead inside. It's cold and hard and petrified.
Lock the doors and close the blinds, we're going for a ride.  
MASTER: It's ready to rise, Doctor. The new Time Lord Empire. It's good, isn't
it? Isn't it good? Anything? No? Anything? Oh, but they broke your hearts,
didn't they, those Toclafane, ever since you worked out what they really are.
They say Martha Jones has come back home. Now why would she do that?  
DOCTOR: Leave her alone.  
MASTER: But you said something to her, didn't you? On the day I took control.
What did you tell her?  
DOCTOR: I have one thing to say to you. You know what it is.  
MASTER: Oh no, you don't!  
(He pushes the Doctor's wheelchair away.)  
TANNOY: Valiant now entering Zone One airspace. Citizens rejoice.  
MASTER: Come on, people! What are we doing? Launch Day in twenty four hours.
(The Doctor holds three fingers against his thigh. Francine repeats the signal
to Clive, who is mopping the deck in a corridor. He passes the signal on to
Tish, who is also a maid, as she takes a meal to the prisoner.)

**[Brig]**

(On LD2, grubby, tattered Jack is being forced to stand all the time, wrists
chained to stout posts on either side.)  
JACK: Morning, Tish. Ah, smell that sea air. Makes me long for good old
British fish and chips. Yeah. What do I get? Cold mashed swede. Some hotel.
Last time I book over the Internet.  
(Tish spoons him his food and puts three fingers against the container. Jack
winks.)

**[Quarry]**

(A giant statue of the Master stands above the rocks.)  
MARTHA: All over the Earth, those things. He's even carved himself into Mount
Rushmore.  
TOM: Best to keep down. Here we go. The entire south coast of England,
converted into shipyards. They bring in slave labour every morning. Break up
cars, houses, anything, just for the metal. Building a fleet out of scrap.  
(A fleet of space rockets.)  
MARTHA: You should see Russia. That's Shipyard Number One. All the way from
the Black Sea to the Bering Strait, there's a hundred thousand rockets getting
ready for war.  
TOM: War? With who?  
MARTHA: The rest of the universe. I've been out there, Tom, in space, before
all this happened, and there's a thousand different civilisations all around
us with no idea of what's happening here. The Master can build weapons big
enough to devastate them all.  
TOM: You've been in space?  
MARTHA: Problem with that?  
TOM: No. No, just er, wow. Anything else I should know?  
MARTHA: I've met Shakespeare.  
(Two spheres fly in from behind the statue.)  
SPHERE: Identify, little man.  
TOM: I've got a licence. Thomas Milligan, Peripatetic Medical Squad. I'm
allowed to travel. I was just checking for  
SPHERE: Soon the rockets will fly, and everyone will need medicine. You'll be
so busy.  
(The spheres fly off to the shipyard, laughing.)  
TOM: But they didn't see you.  
MARTHA: How do you think I travelled the world?  
(She is wearing the Tardis key. They go back to the van.)  
MARTHA: Because the Master set up Archangel, that mobile network, fifteen
satellites around the planet, but really it's transmitting this low level
psychic field. That's how everyone got hypnotised into thinking he was Harold
Saxon.  
TOM: Saxon. Feels like years ago.  
MARTHA: But the key's tuned in to the same frequency. Makes me sort of not
invisible, just unnoticeable.  
TOM: Well, I can see you.  
MARTHA: That's because you wanted to.  
TOM: Yeah, I suppose I did.  
MARTHA: Is there a Mrs Milligan?  
TOM: No. No. What about you?  
MARTHA: There used to be someone.  
(She remembers the Doctor kissing her, then whispering to her.)  
MARTHA: A long time ago. Come on, I've got to find this Docherty woman.  
TOM: We'll have to wait until the next work shift. What time is it now?  
MARTHA: It's nearly three o'clock.

**[Flight deck]**

(14:58 according to the chronometer up on the bridge. The Doctor, Francine and
Tish are there, whilst Clive is still cleaning below decks. Jack can see a
clock from his cage, too, and starts to pull on his chains. The Master enters
the flight deck.)  
MASTER: Time for my massage. Who shall I have today? Tanya. Come on,
sweetheart. Lucy, have you met Tanya? She's gorgeous. Tanya, when we go to the
stars, I'm going to take you to the Catriga Nova. Whirlpools of gold.  
(With seconds to go to 3 o'clock, Jack's chains are coming free of the wall.)  
MASTER: You two should get to know each other. That might be fun.  
(Tanya massages the Master's shoulders.)  
On the stroke of 3, Jack is free. He grabs a steam hose and points it at the
guard. Clive throws water on an electrical circuit and starts a fire.)  
TANNOY: Condition red.  
MASTER: What the hell?  
TANNOY: Repeat, condition red.  
(Francine throws the Master's jacket to Tish. She gives it to the Doctor who
takes the laser screwdriver from the pocket and points it at the Master.)  
MASTER: Oh, I see.  
DOCTOR: I told you. I have one thing to say.  
(The Master laughs.)

**[Passageways]**

(Clive gets caught. Jack is confronted by a squad of armed men, so he
surrenders.)  
JACK: Oh, here we go again.  
(The squad shoot Jack.)

**[Flight deck]**

(The Doctor can't get the laser screwdriver to work.)  
MASTER: Isomorphic controls.  
(He takes screwdriver from the Doctor and punches him.)  
MASTER: Which means they only work for me. Like this.  
(A laser beam just misses Francine.)  
MASTER: Say sorry!  
FRANCINE: Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.  
TISH: Mum!  
MASTER: Didn't you learn anything from the blessed Saint Martha? Siding with
the Doctor is a very dangerous thing to do. Take them away.  
GUARD: Move. Come on.  
MASTER: Okay. Gotcha.  
(The Master helps the Doctor into a chair as Tish and Francine are taken
away.)  
MASTER: Oh boy. There you go, Gramps. Oh, do you know, I remember the days
when the Doctor, oh, that famous Doctor, was waging a Time War, battling Sea
Devils and Axons. He sealed the rift at the Medusa Cascade single handed. And
look at him now. Stealing screwdrivers. How did he ever come to this? Oh yeah,
me.  
DOCTOR: I just need you to listen.  
MASTER: No, it's my turn. Revenge! Best served hot. And this time, it's a
message for Miss Jones.

**[Workshop]**

(Tom cuts a gap in the shipyard's chain link fence, and they run to a building
where an older woman is thumping a cathode ray tube in frustration.)  
TOM: Professor Docherty?  
DOCHERTY: Busy.  
TOM: They, er, they sent word ahead. I'm Tom Milligan. This is Martha Jones.  
DOCHERTY: She can be the Queen of Sheba for all I care. I'm still busy.  
MARTHA: Televisions don't work anymore.  
DOCHERTY: Oh God, I miss Countdown. Never been the same since Des took over.
Both Deses. What's the plural for Des? Desi? Deseen? But we've been told
there's going to be a transmission from the man himself.  
(A static-ridden black and white image appears.)  
DOCHERTY: There!  
MASTER [on TV]: My people. Salutations on this, the eve of war. Lovely woman.
But I know there's all sorts of whispers down there. Stories of a child,
walking the Earth, giving you hope.

**[Flight deck]**

(Francine, Clive and Tish are locked up, and Jack is back in his chains.)  
MASTER: But I ask you

**[Workshop]**

MASTER [on TV]: How much hope has this man got? Say hello, Gandalf. Except
he's not that old, but he's an alien with a much greater lifespan than you
stunted little apes. But what if it showed?

**[Flight deck]**

MASTER: What if I suspend your capacity to regenerate? All nine hundred years
of your life, Doctor. What if we could see them?  
(The Master retunes his screwdriver and zaps the Doctor again.)  
MASTER: Older and older and older. Down you go, Doctor. Down, down, down the
years.  
(Finally the convulsions end. The Doctor is no longer sitting in the
wheelchair.)  
MASTER: Doctor.  
(A tiny creature with big eyes, rather Gollum-like, peers out from the
otherwise empty clothes.)

**[Workshop]**

MASTER [on TV]: Received and understood, Miss Jones?  
(The broadcast ends.)  
TOM: I'm sorry.  
MARTHA: The Doctor's still alive.  
DOCHERTY: Obviously the Archangel Network would seem to be the Master's
greatest weakness. Fifteen satellites all around the Earth, still
transmitting. That's why there's so little resistance. It's broadcasting a
telepathic signal that keeps people scared.  
TOM: We could just take them out.  
DOCHERTY: We could. Fifteen ground to air missiles. You got any on you?
Besides, any military action, the Toclafane descend.  
MARTHA: They're not called Toclafane. That's a name the Master made up.  
DOCHERTY: Then what are they, then?  
MARTHA: That's why I came to find you. Know your enemy. I've got this.  
(A computer disc.)  
MARTHA: No one's been able to look at a sphere close up. They can't even be
damaged, except once. The lightning strike in South Africa brought one of them
down, just by chance. I've got the readings on this.  
(Docherty puts the disc into her computer, and thumps it as it struggles to
read the data.)  
DOCHERTY: Oh, whoever thought we'd miss Bill Gates.  
TOM: So is that why you travelled the world? To find a disc?  
MARTHA: No. Just got lucky.  
DOCHERTY: I heard stories that you walked the Earth to find a way to build a
weapon. There! A current of fifty eight point five kiloamperes transferred
charge of five hundred and ten megajoules precisely.  
TOM: Can you recreate that?  
DOCHERTY: I think so. Easily. Yes.  
MARTHA: Right then, Doctor Milligan, we're going to get us a sphere.  
(Outside Tom fires a gun three times. A sphere chases him.)  
MARTHA: He's coming. You ready?  
DOCHERTY: You do your job, I'll do mine!  
(Tom runs in.)  
TOM: Now!  
(The sphere gets caught in an electrical field set up across a narrow
passageway. After a few moments, it drops to the ground.)  
DOCHERTY: That's only half the job. Let's find out what's inside.

**[Flight deck]**

(The tiny Doctor is imprisoned in a bird cage.)  
FRANCINE [OC]: I'm going To kill him, if I have to wait a hundred years. I'm
going to kill the Master.

**[Brig]**

(Jack has a gun pointed at him all the time now.)  
FRANCINE [OC]: One day he'll let his guard down. One day.

**[Cell]**

FRANCINE: And I'll be there.  
CLIVE: No, that's my job. I'll swear to you, I'd shoot that man stone dead.  
TISH: I'll get him. Even if it kills me.  
FRANCINE: Don't say that.  
TISH: I mean it. That man made us stand on deck and watch the islands of Japan
burning. Millions of people. I swear to you, he's dead.

**[Flight deck]**

(Lucy is still in the glamorous red dress, but she's not a happy little wife
any more.)  
MASTER: Tomorrow, they launch. We're opening up a rift in the Braccatolian
space. They won't see us coming. It kind of scary.  
DOCTOR: Then stop.  
MASTER: Once the Empire is established, and there's a new Gallifrey in the
heavens, maybe then it stops. The drumming. The never ending drumbeat. Ever
since I was a child. I looked into the vortex. That's when it chose me. The
drumming, the call to war. Can't you hear it? Listen, it's there now. Right
now. Tell me you can hear it, Doctor. Tell me.  
DOCTOR: It's only you.  
MASTER: Good.  
(A sphere enters.)  
FEMALE SPHERE: Tomorrow, the war. Tomorrow we rise, never to fall.  
MASTER: You see? I'm doing it for them. You should be grateful. After all, you
love them so very, very much.

**[Workshop]**

(Docherty is trying to open the sphere.)  
DOCHERTY: There's some sort of magnetic clamp. Hold on, I'll just trip the  
(The opens the four quarters of the top of the sphere.)  
DOCHERTY: Oh my God!  
(The sphere contains a tiny wizened head. It opens its eyes and makes them
jump back.)  
DOCHERTY: It's alive.  
SPHERE: Martha. Martha Jones.  
TOM: It knows you.  
SPHERE: Sweet, kind Martha Jones. You helped us to fly.  
MARTHA: What do you mean?  
SPHERE: You led us to salvation.  
MARTHA: Who are you?  
SPHERE: The skies are made of diamonds.  
MARTHA: No. You can't be him.  
CREET [memory]: The skies are made of diamonds.  
SPHERE: We share each other's memories. You sent him to Utopia.  
MARTHA: Oh, my God.  
TOM: What's it talking about? What's it mean?  
DOCHERTY: What are they?  
TOM: Martha. Martha, tell us. What are they?  
MARTHA: They're us. They're humans. The human race from the future.

**[Flight deck]**

MASTER: I took Lucy to Utopia. A Time Lord and his human companion. I took her
to see the stars. Isn't that right, sweetheart?  
LUCY: Trillions of years into the future, to the end of the universe.  
MASTER: Tell him what you saw.  
LUCY: Dying. Everything dying. The whole of creation was falling apart, and I
thought, there's no point. No point to anything. Not ever.  
MASTER: And it's all your fault.

**[Workshop]**

MARTHA: I'd sort of worked it out with the paradox machine, because the Doctor
said, on the day before the Master came to power, he said  
DOCTOR [memory]: When he was stealing the Tardis, the only thing I could do
was fuse the coordinates. I locked them permanently. He can only travel
between the year one hundred trillion and the last place the Tardis landed,
Which is right here, right now.  
MARTHA: The Master had the Tardis, this time machine, but the only other place
he could go was the end of the universe, so he found Utopia.

**[Flight deck]**

MASTER: You should have seen it, Doctor. Furnaces burning. The last of
humanity screaming at the dark.

**[Workshop]**

MARTHA: The Utopia Project was the last hope. Trying to find a way to escape
the end of everything.  
SPHERE: There was no solution, no diamonds. Just the dark and the cold.

**[Flight deck]**

MASTER: All that human invention that had sustained them across the eons. It
all turned inwards. They cannibalised themselves.  
FEMALE SPHERE: We made ourselves so pretty.  
MASTER: Regressing into children. But it didn't work. The universe was
collapsing around them.

**[Workshop]**

SPHERE: But then the Master came with his wonderful time machine to bring us
back home.  
DOCHERTY: But that's a paradox. If you're the future of the human race, and
you've come back to murder your ancestors, you should cancel yourselves out.
You shouldn't exist.  
MARTHA: And that's the paradox machine.

**[Flight deck]**

MASTER: My masterpiece, Doctor. A living Tardis, strong enough to hold the
paradox in place, allowing the past and the future to collide in infinite
majesty.  
DOCTOR: But you're changing history. Not just Earth, the entire universe.  
MASTER: I'm a Time Lord. I have that right.  
DOCTOR: But even then, why come all this way just to destroy?  
FEMALE SPHERE: We come backwards in time all to build a brand new empire
lasting one hundred trillion years.  
MASTER: With me as their master. Time Lord and humans combined. Haven't you
always dreamt of that, Doctor?

**[Workshop]**

TOM: But what about us? We're the same species. Why do you kill so many of us?  
SPHERE: Because it's fun!  
(Tom shoots the head.)

**[Flight deck]**

MASTER: Human race, greatest monsters of them all. Night, then.  
(The Master and Lucy leave, and the sphere follows.)

**[Docherty's room]**

DOCHERTY: I think it's time we had the truth, Miss Jones. The legend says
you've travelled the world to find a way of killing the Master. Tell us, is it
true?  
MARTHA: Just before I escaped, the Doctor told me. The Doctor and the Master,
they've been coming to Earth for years. And they've been watched. There's UNIT
and Torchwood, all studying Time Lords in secret. And they made this, the
ultimate defence.  
(Martha opens the case to reveal a gun-like device, with a squeeze trigger and
four small cylinders along the top. She also has three vials of coloured
liquid.)  
TOM: All you need to do is get close. I can shoot the Master dead with this.  
DOCHERTY: Actually, you can put that down now, thank you very much.  
MARTHA: Point is, it's not so easy to kill a Time Lord. They can regenerate.
Literally bring themselves back to life.  
DOCHERTY: Ah, the Master's immortal. Wonderful.  
MARTHA: Except for this. Four chemicals, slotted into the gun. Inject him.
Kills a Time Lord permanently.  
TOM: Four chemicals? You've only got three.  
MARTHA: Still need the last one, because the components of this gun were kept
safe, scattered across the world, and I found them. San Diego, Beijing,
Budapest and London.  
TOM: Then where is it?  
MARTHA: There's an old UNIT base, north London. I've found the access codes.
Tom, you've got to get me there.

**[Workshop]**

TOM: We can't get across London in the dark. It's full of wild dogs. We'll get
eaten alive. We can wait till the morning, then go with the medical convoy.  
DOCHERTY: You can spend the night here, if you like.  
TOM: No, we can get halfway, stay at the slave quarters in Bexley. Professor,
thank you.  
DOCHERTY: And you. Good luck.  
MARTHA: Thanks.  
DOCHERTY: Martha, could you do it? Could you actually kill him?  
MARTHA: I've got no choice.  
DOCHERTY: You might be many things, but you don't look like a killer to me.

**[Outside the slave quarters]**

(Tom and Martha dodge a patrol, and knock on a door.)  
TOM: Let me in. It's Milligan.

**[Slave quarters]**

(The place is full to bursting.)  
WOMAN: Did you bring food?  
TOM: Couldn't get any, and I'm starving.  
WOMAN: All we've got is water.  
MARTHA: I'm sorry.  
TOM: It's cheaper than building barracks. Pack them in, a hundred in each
house, ferry them off to the shipyards every morning.  
BOY: Are you Martha Jones?  
MARTHA: Yeah, that's me.  
BOY: Can you do it? Can you kill him? They said you can kill the Master, can
you? Tell us you can do it. Please, tell us you can do it.  
WOMAN: Who is the Master?  
(A babble of voices.)  
TOM: Come on, just leave her alone. She's exhausted.  
MARTHA: No, it's all right. They want me to talk, and I will.

**[Workshop]**

(Docherty opens a High Voltage box to reveal an Archangel communications
device.)  
DOCHERTY: Access Priority One. This is Professor Alison Docherty.  
COMPUTER: State your intent.  
DOCHERTY: First of all, I need to know about my son.  
COMPUTER: State your intent.  
DOCHERTY: Is my son still alive?  
COMPUTER: State your intent.  
DOCHERTY: I have some information for the Master concerning Martha Jones.

**[Flight deck]**

(The Master enters in a silk dressing gown and wakes up the Doctor.)  
MASTER: Guess what.

**[Slave quarters]**

MARTHA: I travelled across the world, from the ruins of New York to the fusion
mills of China, right across the radiation pits of Europe. And everywhere I
went, I saw people just like you, living as slaves. But if Martha Jones became
a legend, then that's wrong, because my name isn't important. There's someone
else. The man who sent me out there. The man who told me to walk the Earth.
And his name is the Doctor. He has saved your lives so many times, and you
never even knew he was there. He never stops. He never stays. He never asks to
be thanked. But I've seen him. I know him. I love him. And I know what he can
do.  
WOMAN: It's him! It's him! Oh my God, it's him! It's the Master. He's here.  
BOY: But he never comes to Earth. He never walks upon the ground.  
WOMAN: Hide her!  
TOM: Use this.  
(They cover Martha with an old sack. Outside, the Master is accompanied by
armed guards and spheres. Tom readies his gun by the letter box.)  
BOY: He walks among us, our lord and master.

**[Outside the slave quarters]**

MASTER: Martha. Martha Jones. I can see you! Out you come, little girl. Come
and meet your master. Anybody? Nobody? No? Nothing? Positions. I'll give the
order unless you surrender. Ask yourself. What would the Doctor do? (Martha
takes off the Tardis key and goes outside.)  
MASTER: Oh, yes. Oh, very well done. Good girl. He trained you well. Bag. Give
me the bag. No, stay there. Just throw it.  
(Martha throws her backpack towards the Master, who fires his laser
screwdriver at it.)  
MASTER: And now, good companion, your work is done.  
(The Master points his laser at Martha. Tom runs out of the house.)  
TOM: No!  
(The Master kills Tom, and laughs.)  
MASTER: But you, when you die, the Doctor should be witness, hmm? Almost dawn,
Martha, and planet Earth marches to war.

**[Flight deck]**

MASTER [OC]: Citizens of Earth, rejoice and observe.  
(Guards bring Martha in. Clive, Francine and Tish are already there on one
side. and Jack on the other.)  
MASTER: Your teleport device, in case you thought I'd forgotten.  
(Martha throws the vortex manipulator to the Master.)  
MASTER: And now, kneel. Down below, the fleet is ready to launch. Two hundred
thousand ships set to burn across the universe. Are we ready?  
MAN [OC]: The fleet awaits your signal. Rejoice!  
MASTER: Three minutes to align the black hole converters. Counting down. I
never could resist a ticking clock. My children, are you ready?  
SPHERES [in orbit]: We will fly and blaze and slice. We will fly and blaze and
slice. MASTER: At zero, to mark this day, the child Martha Jones, will die. My
first blood. Any last words? No? Such a disappointment, this one. Days of old,
Doctor, you had companions who could absorb the time vortex. This one's
useless. Bow your head. And so it falls to me, as Master of all, to establish
from this day, a new order of Time Lords. From this day forward  
(Martha laughs quietly.)  
MASTER: What. What's so funny?  
MARTHA: A gun.  
MASTER: What about it?  
MARTHA: A gun in four parts?  
MASTER: Yes, and I destroyed it.  
MARTHA: A gun in four parts scattered across the world? I mean, come on, did
you really believe that?  
MASTER: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: As if I would ask her to kill.  
MASTER: Oh well, it doesn't matter. I've got her exactly where I want her.  
MARTHA: But I knew what Professor Docherty would do. The Resistance knew about
her son.  
MARTHA [memory]: That's why I came to find you. Know your enemy.  
MARTHA: I told her about the gun, so she'd get me here at the right time.  
MASTER: Oh, but you're still going to die.  
MARTHA: Don't you want to know what I was doing, travelling the world?  
MASTER: Tell me.  
MARTHA: I told a story, that's all. No weapons, just words. I did just what
the Doctor said. I went across the continents all on my own. And everywhere I
went, I found the people, and I told them my story.  
MARTHA [in slave quarters]: He has saved your lives so many times, and you
never even knew he was there. I know him.  
MARTHA: I told them about the Doctor.  
MARTHA [in slave quarters]: I love him.  
MARTHA: And I told them to pass it on, to spread the word so that everyone
would know about the Doctor.  
MASTER: Faith and hope? Is that all?  
MARTHA: No, because I gave them an instruction, just as the Doctor said.  
(Martha stands up.)  
DOCTOR [memory]: Use the countdown.  
MARTHA: I told them that if everyone thinks of one word, at one specific time  
MASTER: Nothing will happen. Is that your weapon? Prayer?  
MARTHA: Right across the world, in word, just one thought at one moment but
with fifteen satellites.  
MASTER: What?  
JACK: The Archangel Network.  
MARTHA: A telepathic field binding the whole human race together, with all of
them, every single person on Earth, thinking the same thing at the same time.
And that word is Doctor.  
(Zero. The Doctor and his cage starts to glow.)  
MASTER: Stop it. No, no, no, no, you don't.  
JACK: Doctor. Doctor.  
FRANCINE: Doctor.  
MASTER: Don't.  
CROWD [on monitor]: Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.  
MASTER: Stop this right now. Stop it!  
LUCY: Doctor.  
JACK: Doctor.  
MARTHA: Doctor.  
CROWD [on monitor]: Doctor.  
(The Doctor is back to his previous centegenarian form.)  
DOCTOR: I've had a whole year to tune myself into the psychic network and
integrate with its matrices.  
MASTER: I order you to stop!  
CROWDS: Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.  
LUCY: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: The one thing you can't do. Stop them thinking.  
(The Doctor is back to his normal appearance.)  
DOCTOR: Tell me the human race is degenerate now, when they can do this.  
(Martha runs to Francine and Tish for a group hug.)  
MASTER: No!  
(He fires laser screwdriver at the Doctor, but the energy field is still
around him and it doesn't get through.)  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.  
MASTER: Then I'll kill them.  
(The Doctor stretches out his hand and the screwdriver flies from the Master's
hand.)  
MASTER: You can't do this. You can't do it. It's not fair!  
DOCTOR: And you know what happens now.  
MASTER: No! No! No! No!  
(The Doctor floats towards the Master.)  
DOCTOR: You wouldn't listen.  
MASTER: No!  
DOCTOR: Because you know what I'm going to say.  
MASTER: No.  
(The Master curls into a ball in the corner. The Doctor puts his arms around
him.)  
DOCTOR: I forgive you.  
MASTER: My children.  
SPHERES [in orbit]: Protect the paradox. Protect the paradox. Protect the
paradox.  
DOCTOR: Captain, the paradox machine!  
JACK: You men, with me! You stay here.  
(The Doctor spots the Master activating the manipulator, and grabs it.)  
DOCTOR: No!

**[Quarry]**

MASTER: Now it ends, Doctor. Now it ends.  
(A roll of thunder, and sirens sound in the shipyard.)

**[Flight deck]**

MARTHA: We've all six billion spheres heading right for us.

**[Quarry]**

DOCTOR: We've got control of the Valiant. You can't launch.  
MASTER: Oh, but I've got this. Black hole converter inside every ship. If I
can't have this world, Doctor, then neither can you. We shall stand upon this
Earth together, as it burns.

**[Valiant]**

(Jack and the guards find three spheres are guarding the Tardis, so they start
shooting at them. The rest are hurtling back down towards the Valiant.) GUARD:
Can't get in. We'd get slaughtered.  
JACK: Yeah. Happens to me a lot.  
(Jack goes in alone.)

**[Quarry]**

DOCTOR: Weapon after weapon after weapon. All you do is talk and talk and
talk. But over all these years and all these disasters, I've always had the
greatest secret of them all. I know you. Explode those ships, you kill
yourself. That's the one thing you can never do. Give that to me.  
(The Master hands over the black hole converter trigger. Jack gets inside the
Tardis and empties his machine gun clip at the paradox machine. It goes Bang.  
At the quarry, the ground shakes as the Doctor and the Master struggle for the
vortex manipulator. They disappear together.)

**[Flight deck]**

(The spheres disappear and the ship shakes. Papers are flying everywhere.
Martha gets thrown into the Doctor's arms.)  
DOCTOR: Everyone get down! Time is reversing!  
(The Master is hanging onto some railings. Francine sees a pistol on the
floor. Meanwhile, the winds of time are creating havoc and panic on the
ground, until finally the people, the rockets and the statues disappear. Calm
returns and a red bus drives around Piccadilly Circus.)  
DOCTOR: The paradox is broken. We've reverted back, one year and one day. Two
minutes past eight in the morning.  
MAN [OC]: This is UNIT Central. What's happened up there? We just saw the
President assassinated.  
DOCTOR: Just after the President was killed, but just before the spheres
arrived. Everything back to normal. Planet Earth restored. None of it
happened. The rockets, the terror. It never was.  
MARTHA: What about the spheres?  
DOCTOR: Trapped at the end of the universe.  
FRANCINE: But I can remember it.  
DOCTOR: We're at the eye of the storm. The only ones who'll ever know. Oh,
hello. You must be Mister Jones. We haven't actually met.  
(The Master runs for the door just as Jack is coming in.)  
JACK: Whoa, big fella! You don't want to miss the party. Cuffs. So, what do we
do with this one?  
CLIVE: We kill him.  
TISH: We execute him.  
DOCTOR: No, that's not the solution.  
(Francine aims the pistol at the Master.)  
FRANCINE: Oh, I think so. Because all those things, they still happened
because of him. I saw them.  
MASTER: Go on. Do it.  
DOCTOR: Francine, you're better than him.  
(The Doctor gets Francine to lower the gun and he hugs her, then hands her off
to Martha.)  
MASTER: You still haven't answered the question. What happens to me?  
DOCTOR: You're my responsibility from now on. The only Time Lord left in
existence.  
JACK: Yeah, but you can't trust him.  
DOCTOR: No. The only safe place for him is the Tardis.  
MASTER: You mean you're just going to keep me?  
DOCTOR: Mmm. If that's what I have to do. It's time to change. Maybe I've been
wandering for too long. Now I've got someone to care for.  
(Lucy shoots the Master. The Doctor catches him as he staggers back.)  
JACK: Put it down.  
DOCTOR: There you go. I've got you. I've got you.  
MASTER: Always the women.  
DOCTOR: I didn't see her.  
MASTER: Dying in your arms. Happy now?  
DOCTOR: You're not dying. Don't be stupid. It's only a bullet. Just
regenerate.  
MASTER: No.  
DOCTOR: One little bullet. Come on.  
MASTER: I guess you don't know me so well. I refuse.  
DOCTOR: Regenerate. Just regenerate. Please. Please! Just regenerate. Come on.  
MASTER: And spend the rest of my life imprisoned with you?  
DOCTOR: You've got to. Come on. It can't end like this. You and me, all the
things we've done. Axons. Remember the Axons? And the Daleks. We're the only
two left. There's no one else. Regenerate!  
MASTER: How about that. I win. Will it stop, Doctor? The drumming. Will it
stop?  
(The Master dies.)  
DOCTOR: No!  
(Somewhere, later, the Doctor lights the Master's funeral pyre then walks
away.)

**[Park]**

(Alison Docherty is walking along a path when Martha runs up to her and give
her a bunch of flowers.)  
MARTHA: Just to say, I don't blame you.  
DOCHERTY: But who are you?

**[Roald Dahl Plass]**

MARTHA: Time was, every single one of these people knew your name. Now they've
all forgotten you.  
DOCTOR: Good.  
JACK: Back to work.  
DOCTOR: I really don't mind, though. Come with me.  
JACK: I had plenty of time to think that past year, the year that never was,
and I kept thinking about that team of mine. Like you said, Doctor,
responsibility.  
DOCTOR: Defending the Earth. Can't argue with that.  
(The Doctor takes Jack's hand and exposes the vortex manipulator on his
wrist.)  
JACK: Hey, I need that.  
DOCTOR: I can't have you walking around with a time travelling teleport. You
could go anywhere, twice. The second time to apologise.  
(The Doctor sonics the manipulator.)  
JACK: And what about me? Can you fix that? Will I ever be able to die?  
DOCTOR: Nothing I can do. You're an impossible thing, Jack.  
JACK: Been called that before. Sir. Ma'am. But I keep wondering. What about
aging? Because I can't die but I keep getting older. The odd little grey hair,
you know? What happens if I live for a million years?  
DOCTOR: I really don't know.  
JACK: Okay, vanity. Sorry. Yeah, can't help it. Used to be a poster boy when I
was a kid living on the Boeshane Peninsula. Tiny little place. I was the first
one ever to be signed up for the Time Agency. They were so proud of me. The
Face of Boe, they called me. Hmm. I'll see you.  
(Jack head off towards Torchwood's secret entrance.)  
DOCTOR: No.  
MARTHA: It can't be.  
DOCTOR: No. Definitely not. No. No.

**[Outside Francine's home]**

(The Doctor watches Francine, Martha, Clive and Tish inside the house from
across the street where the Tardis is parked, then goes inside it. His spare
hand is now attached to the base of the console. A little later, Martha leaves
the house, making a telephone call.)  
MARTHA: Yeah. Could you put me through? Hi, I'm looking for a Doctor Thomas
Milligan.

**[Hospital]**

TOM: Yeah.

**[Outside Francine's home]**

TOM [OC]: Hello?

**[Hospital]**

TOM: Hello?  
(Martha hangs up.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Right then, off we go. The open road. There is a burst of starfire
right now over the coast of Meta Sigmafolio. Oh, the sky is like oil on water.
Fancy a look? Or back in time. We could, I don't know, Charles the Second?
Henry the Eighth. I know. What about Agatha Christie? I'd love to meet Agatha
Christie. I bet she's brilliant. Okay.  
MARTHA: I just can't.  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
MARTHA: Spent all these years training to be a doctor. Now I've got people to
look after. They saw half the planet slaughtered and they're devastated. I
can't leave them.  
DOCTOR: Of course not. Thank you. Martha Jones, you saved the world.  
MARTHA: Yes, I did. I spent a lot of time with you thinking I was second best,
but you know what? I am good. You going to be all right?  
DOCTOR: Always. Yeah.  
MARTHA: Right then. Bye.  
(Martha leaves, then goes back inside.)  
MARTHA: Because the thing is, it's like my friend Vicky. She lived with this
bloke, student housing, there were five of them all packed in, and this bloke
was called Sean. And she loved him. She did. She completely adored him. Spent
all day long talking about him.  
DOCTOR: Is this going anywhere?  
MARTHA: Yes. Because he never looked at her twice. I mean, he liked her, but
that was it. And she wasted years pining after him. Years of her life. Because
while he was around, she never looked at anyone else. And I told her, I always
said to her, time and time again, I said, get out. So this is me, getting out.  
(She throws her mobile phone to him.)  
MARTHA: Keep that, because I'm not having you disappear. If that rings, when
that rings, you'd better come running. Got it?  
DOCTOR: Got it.  
MARTHA: I'll see you again, mister.  
(Martha leaves and the Tardis dematerialises.  
The Master's pyre has burnt out. A hand with red fingernails takes his signet
ring from the ashes.  
Suddenly there is the sound of a ship's foghorn, and the bow of a ship smashes
through the side of the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: What. What?  
(He picks up a lifebelt with the name Titanic on it.)  
DOCTOR: What?
