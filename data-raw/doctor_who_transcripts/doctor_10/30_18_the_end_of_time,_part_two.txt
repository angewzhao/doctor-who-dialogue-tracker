**The End of Time, part two**  
  
Original Airdate: 1 Jan, 2010  

**[Black void]**

(Gallifrey is in ruins. Only the Citadel stands inside its protective dome.
The man we saw as the Narrator in part one strides across a bridge followed by
two acolytes and takes his seat at the head of a table. Six time lords sit,
three on each side, whilst a woman is at the far end, scribbling on
parchments. The rest of the space is in darkness.)  
RASSILON: What news of the Doctor?  
CHANCELLOR: Disappeared, my Lord President.  
PARTISAN: (a woman) But we know his intention. He still possesses the Moment,
and he'll use it to destroy Daleks and Time Lords alike.  
CHANCELLOR: The Visionary confirms it.  
(The Visionary is the woman at the end of the table. She has henna tattoos on
her face and hands.)  
VISIONARY: Ending, burning, falling. All of it falling. The black and pitch
and screaming fire, so burning.  
CHANCELLOR: All of her prophecies say the same. That this is the last day of
the Time War. That Gallifrey falls. That we die, today.  
VISIONARY: Ending. Ending. Ending. Ending!  
PARTISAN: Perhaps it's time. This is only the furthest edge of the Time War.
But at its heart, millions die every second, lost in bloodlust and insanity.
With time itself resurrecting them, to find new ways of dying over and over
again. A travesty of life. Isn't it better to end it, at last?  
RASSILON: Thank you for your opinion.  
(The Lord President stands and aims his blue metal gauntlet at the Partisan.
Energy strikes her, she screams and is atomised.)  
RASSILON: I will not die! Do you hear me? A billion years of Time Lord history
riding on our backs. I will not let this perish. I will not!  
CHANCELLOR: There is, er, there is one part of the prophecy, my Lord.  
(The Chancellor brings a paper to the Lord President.)  
CHANCELLOR: Forgive me, I'm sorry. It's rather difficult to decipher, but it
talks of two survivors beyond the Final Day. Two children of Gallifrey.  
RASSILON: Does it name them?  
CHANCELLOR: It foresees them locked in their final confrontation, The Enmity
of Ages, which would suggest  
RASSILON: The Doctor! And the Master.  
CHANCELLOR: One word keeps being repeated, my Lord. One constant word. Earth.  
VISIONARY: Earth. Earth. Earth. Earth. Earth. Earth.  
CHANCELLOR: Planet Earth. Indigenous species, the human race.  
(A projection of the planet appears above the table.)  
VISIONARY: Earth. Earth. Earth.  
RASSILON: Maybe that's where the answer lies. Our salvation. On Earth.

**[Naismith's study]**

(The Doctor has been bound and gagged, strapped upright to a trolley. Wilf is
tied to a chair nearby.)  
MASTER: Now then, I've got a planet to run. Is everybody ready?  
NAISMITH-MASTER [on screen]: Six billion, seven hundred and twenty seven
million, nine hundred and

**[Gate room]**

NAISMITH-MASTER: Forty nine thousand three hundred and thirty eight versions
of us

**[Naismith's study]**

NAISMITH-MASTER [on screen]: Awaiting orders.  
OBAMA-MASTER [on screen]: This is Washington. As President of the United
States, I can transfer all the United Nations protocols to you immediately,
putting you in charge of all the Earth's defences.  
GENERAL-MASTER [on screen]: UNIT HQ, Geneva reporting. All under your command,
sir.  
CHINESE-MASTER [on screen]: And this is the Central Military Commission here
in Beijing, sir, with over two point five million soldiers, sir. Present arms!  
MASTER: Enough soldiers and weapons to turn this planet into a warship.
Nothing to say, Doctor? What's that? Pardon? Sorry?  
WILF: You let him go, you swine.  
MASTER: Oh, your dad's still kicking up a fuss.  
WILF: Yeah? Well, I'd be proud if I was.  
MASTER: Hush, now. Listen to your Master.  
(Ring, ring.)  
MASTER: But that's a mobile.  
WILF: Yeah, it's mine. Let me turn it off.  
MASTER: No, no, no, no, no. I don't think you understand. Everybody on this
planet is me. And I'm not phoning you, so who the hell is that?  
WILF: It's nobody. I tell you, it's nothing. It's probably one of them ring-
back calls.  
(The Master searches Wilf's pockets and finds the revolver.)  
MASTER: Ooo, and look at this. Good man!  
(He tosses it on the floor and gets the phone.)  
MASTER: Donna. Who's Donna?  
WILF: She's no one. Just leave it.  
DONNA [OC]: Gramps, don't hang up. You've got to help me.

**[Alleyway]**

DONNA: I ran out, but everyone was changing.

**[Naismith's study]**

MASTER: Who is she? Why didn't she change?  
DONNA [OC]: Gramps, I can't hear you.  
WILF: Well, it was this thing the Doctor did. He did it to her. The
Metacrisis.  
MASTER: Oh, he loves playing with Earth girls. Ugh!  
DONNA [OC]: Are you there?

**[Gate room]**

MASTER [on screen]: Find her. Trace the call.  
NAISMITH-MASTER: Trace the call.  
(A scientist-Master obeys.)

**[Naismith's study]**

DONNA [OC]: Are you still there? Can you hear me?  
MASTER: Say goodbye to the freak, Granddad.  
WILF: Donna, get out of there! Just get out of there. I'm telling you, run!

**[Gate room]**

NAISMITH-MASTER: She's on Wessex Lane, Chiswick. Open the phone lines.
Everyone on Wessex Lane. Red alert.  
DONNA [OC]: What do I do?  
WILF: Run, sweetheart, that's all. Run for your life!

**[Alleyway]**

(Two Master lookalikes block Donna in.)  
DONNA: There's more of them.  
WILF [OC]: Donna? What's happening? Are you still there?  
DONNA: They're everywhere.  
CHISWICK-MASTER: Oh, I'm starving.  
WILF [OC]: Look, I'm telling you to run, Donna.  
CHISWICK-MASTER 2: I'm still hungry.

**[Naismith's study]**

WILF: Just run, sweetheart.

**[Alleyway]**

WILF [OC]: Just run.  
(All the local Masters advance on Donna.)  
DONNA: It's not just them. I can see those things again. Those creatures. Why
can I see a giant wasp?

**[Naismith's study]**

WILF: Donna, don't think about that. Donna, my love

**[Alleyway]**

WILF [OC]: Don't!  
DONNA: And it hurts. My head. It keeps getting hotter, and hotter, and hotter,
and hotter, and hotter!  
(Golden energy surges from Donna, travelling along the alleyway and knocking
down the Chiswick-Masters.)  
DONNA: What did I  
(Donna collapses.)

**[Naismith's study]**

WILF: Donna? What was that? Donna? Donna, are you there? Donna.! Donna! Donna!  
(The Doctor is smiling, and he winks. The Master goes over and removes his
gag.)  
DOCTOR: That's better. Hello. But really, did you think I'd leave my best
friend without a defence mechanism?  
WILF: Doctor? What happened?  
DOCTOR: She's all right. She's fine, I promise. She'll just sleep.  
MASTER: Tell me, where's your Tardis?  
DOCTOR: You could be so wonderful.  
MASTER: Where is it?  
DOCTOR: You're a genius. You're stone cold brilliant, you are. I swear, you
really are. But you could be so much more. You could be beautiful. With a mind
like that, we could travel the stars. It would be my honour. Because you don't
need to own the universe, just see it. To have the privilege of seeing the
whole of time and space. That's ownership enough.  
MASTER: Would it stop, then? The noise in my head?  
DOCTOR: I can help.  
MASTER: I don't know what I'd be without that noise.  
DOCTOR: I wonder what I'd be, without you.  
MASTER: Yeah.  
WILF: What does he mean? What noise?  
MASTER: It began on Gallifrey, as children. Not that you'd call it childhood.
More a life of duty. Eight years old. I was taken for initiation, to stare
into the Untempered Schism.  
WILF: What does that mean?  
DOCTOR: It's a gap in the fabric of reality. You can see into the Time Vortex
itself. And it hurts.  
MASTER: They took me there in the dark. I looked into time, old man, and I
heard it calling to me. Drums. The never ending drums.

**[Black void]**

RASSILON: The Untempered Schism. That's when it began.  
CHANCELLOR: History says the Master heard a rhythm. A torment that stayed with
him for the rest of his life.  
RASSILON: A drumbeat. A warrior's march.  
CHANCELLOR: A symptom of insanity, my Lord.  
(The Visionary taps the rhythm for them with her long fingernail on the metal
surface of the table.)  
RASSILON: A rhythm of four. The heartbeat of a Time Lord.

**[Naismith's study]**

MASTER: Listen to it. Listen.  
DOCTOR: Then let's find it. You and me.  
MASTER: Except. Oh. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, yes. Oh, that's good.  
DOCTOR: What? What is?  
MASTER: The noise exists within my head, and now within six billion heads.
Everyone on Earth can hear it. Imagine. Oh. Oh, yes.  
(The Master's skeleton becomes briefly visible again.)  
DOCTOR: The Gate wasn't enough. You're still dying.  
MASTER: This body was born out of death. All it can do is die. But what did
you say to me, back in the wasteland? You said the end of time.  
DOCTOR: I said something is returning. I was shown a prophecy. That's why I
need your help.  
MASTER: What if I'm part of it? Don't you see? The drumbeat is calling from so
far away. From the end of time itself. And now it's been amplified six billion
times. Triangulate all those signals. I could find its source. Oh, Doctor.
That's what your prophecy was. Me!  
(He slaps the Doctor.)  
MASTER: Where's the Tardis?  
DOCTOR: No. Just stop. Just think.  
MASTER: (to guard) Kill him.  
(A helmeted guard goes over to Wilf.)  
MASTER: I need that technology, Doctor. Tell me where it is, or the old man is
dead.  
WILF: Don't tell him.  
MASTER: I'll kill him right now!  
DOCTOR: Actually, the most impressive thing about you is that after all this
time, you're still bone dead stupid.  
MASTER: Take aim.  
DOCTOR: You've got six billion pairs of eyes, but you still can't see the
obvious, can you?  
MASTER: Like what?  
DOCTOR: That guard is one inch too tall.  
(The guard knocks out the Master with his rifle butt, then removes his helmet
to reveal a green spiky head.)  
ROSSITER: Oh my God, I hit him. I've never hit anyone in my life.  
(Green Addams runs in.)  
ADDAMS: Well, come on. We need to get out of here fast.  
(She frees Wilf while Rossiter releases the Doctor.)  
WILF: God bless the cactuses!  
DOCTOR: That's cacti.  
ROSSITER: That's racist!

**[Gate room]**

NAISMITH-MASTER: This prophecy of yours, Doctor, where did it come from?
Doctor?

**[Naismith's study]**

ADDAMS: Come on! We've got to get out.  
ROSSITER: There's too many buckles and straps.  
ADDAMS: Just wheel him.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Get me out. No, no, no, don't. Don't! No, no, no.

**[Gate room]**

(The Doctor is wheeled across in front of the camera feed to the screen.)  
NAISMITH-MASTER: What's going on? Doctor!

**[Corridor]**

ROSSITER: Which way?  
ADDAMS: This way.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. The other way. I've got my Tardis.  
ADDAMS: I know what I'm doing.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, just just listen to me!

**[Naismith's study]**

(The Master comes to as three guards run in.)  
MASTER: Find him. Find him!

**[Corridor]**

DOCTOR: Not the stairs. Not the stairs!

**[Basement corridor]**

DOCTOR: Worst rescue ever!

**[Gate room]**

GUARD-MASTER [OC]: Underneath the Gate room, sir.  
NAISMITH-MASTER: Basement. Get him.  
GUARD-MASTERS: Yes, sir.

**[Basement]**

DOCTOR: Just, just stop and listen to me!  
(The Master runs in with armed guards.)  
MASTER: Gotcha.  
ADDAMS: You think so?  
(She presses her wristwatch.)  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, don't!  
(She, Rossiter, Wilf and the Doctor vanish.)

**[Teleport room]**

DOCTOR: Now get me out of this thing!  
ADDAMS: Don't say thanks, will you.  
DOCTOR: He's not going to let us go. Just hurry up and get me out!  
(Wilf looks out of a nearby window.)  
WILF: Oh, my goodness me. We're in space!  
DOCTOR: Come on.  
ADDAMS: All right!  
DOCTOR: Oh, get a move on.  
(They are on a spaceship made from very large round modules.)

**[Basement]**

(The Master works at a keyboard.)  
NAISMITH-MASTER [OC]: Open the teleport and follow him!

**[Teleport room]**

DOCTOR: Come on!  
ADDAMS: All right.  
(They finally get the Doctor free. He zaps the teleport controls with his
sonic screwdriver.)

**[Gate room]**

MASTER: He's still up there. Target practice.

**[Teleport room]**

DOCTOR: Where's your flight deck?  
ADDAMS: But we're safe. We're a hundred thousand miles above the Earth.  
DOCTOR: And he's got every single missile on the planet ready to fire.  
ADDAMS: Good point.  
(Addams, Rossiter and the Doctor runs out. The Doctor returns to gently lead
Wilf away from the window.)  
WILF: But we're in space!  
DOCTOR: Yep.

**[Gate room]**

MASTER: Turn everything you've got to the skies. Find me that ship. And prime
the missiles.

**[UNIT HQ Geneva]**

GENERAL-MASTER: Open up the radar. Maximum scan.  
OPERATIVE-MASTERS: Yes, sir.

**[Flight deck]**

DOCTOR: We've got to close it down!  
ROSSITER: No chance, mate. We're going home.  
ADDAMS: We're just a salvage team. Local politics has got nothing to do with
us. Not unless there's a carnival. Sooner we get back to Vinvocci space the
better.  
DOCTOR: We're not leaving.  
(The Doctor sonically sabotages the flight controls. The whole spaceship goes
dark.)

**[UNIT HQ Geneva]**

GENERAL-MASTER: Anything?

**[Flight deck]**

(Silent running.)  
DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.

**[UNIT HQ Geneva]**

OPERATIVE-MASTER: I'm sorry, sir. Nothing.

**[Gate room]**

GENERAL-MASTER [on screen]: Lost him.  
MASTER: What about teleport coordinates?

**[Basement]**

MASTER [OC]: I need that information.  
GUARD-MASTER: He's cut the link, sir.

**[Gate room]**

GUARD-MASTER [OC]: No trace. All dead.

**[Basement]**

GUARD-MASTER: Still, open fire!  
(The guards shoot up the computers.)  
GUARD-MASTER: No way back now. He's stranded.

**[Flight deck]**

ADDAMS: No sign of any missiles. No sign of anything. You've wrecked the
place!  
ROSSITER: The engines are burnt out. All we've got is auxiliary lights.
Everything else is kaput. We can't move. We're stuck in orbit.  
ADDAMS: Thanks to you, you idiot!  
(Addams leaves.)  
WILF: I know you, though. I bet you've got a plan, haven't you? Eh? Come on.
You've always got a trick up your sleeve. Nice little bit of the old Doctor
flim-flam, (Tommy Cooper impression) sort of thing? Eh? Oh, blimey.

**[Gate room]**

MASTER: Night has fallen. Are we ready?

**[Naismith's study]**

NAISMITH-MASTER: Every single one of us is prepared.

**[Gate room]**

MASTER: Then we listen. All of us, across the world, just listen.  
(The whole Master population of Earth holds their breath and listens.)  
MASTER: Concentrate. Find the signal. There! The sound is tangible. Someone
could only have designed this. But who?

**[Black void]**

CHANCELLOR: The signal has been sent. A simple task of four beats transmitted
back through time, and implanted in the Master's mind as a child.  
RASSILON: Then we have a link to where the Master is right now.  
CHANCELLOR: But we're still trapped inside the Timelock, sir. The link is
nothing more than a thought, an idea.  
RASSILON: Then we need something to make the contact physical. Something so
simple.  
VISIONARY: So small and shining. Shining bright and cold. The tiny, tiny star,
falling, falling, burning, burning, burning.  
(The Lord President takes a diamond from his staff.)  
RASSILON: Small enough to follow the link. And if this were on Earth.  
(He throws the diamond at the image of the Earth. The Doctor is working on
some wiring when he sees a bright object streaking towards the planet.)

**[Naismith's study]**

NAISMITH-MASTER: The sound. It's coming from above.

**[Gate room]**

MASTER: It's coming from the sky!

**[Terrace]**

MASTER: There! Find it. Get out there and find it!  
(The diamond falls to Earth with a big bang.)  
GUARDS: Yes, sir.

**[Field]**

(Two Land Rovers drive up to the burning crater. The diamond is intact,
sitting at the bottom of the hole.)  
GUARD-MASTER: It's a diamond, sir. Oh. The most impossible diamond. You won't
believe this.

**[Gate room]**

GUARD-MASTER [OC]: It's a Whitepoint star.

**[Spaceship corridor]**

WILF: Doctor? Hello? Hello? Is that you? Doctor? Anyone? Anyone? Oh, I think
I'm lost.  
WOMAN: And yet you are found. Events are closing. The day is almost upon us.
But tell me, old soldier. Did you take arms?  
WILF: I brought this. But what am I supposed to do?  
WOMAN: This is the Doctor's final battle. At the end of his life, he must
stand at arms, or lose himself and all this world, to the End of Time.  
WILF: But he never carries guns. He doesn't do. Who are you?  
WOMAN: I was lost, so very long ago.

**[Teleport room]**

WILF: Aye, aye. Got this old tub mended?  
DOCTOR: Just trying to fix the heating.  
WILF: Oh. I've always dreamt of a view like that. Hee, hee. I'm an astronaut.
It's dawn over England, look. Brand new day. My wife's buried down there. I
might never visit her again now. Do you think he changed them, in their
graves?  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.  
WILF: No, not your fault.  
DOCTOR: Isn't it?  
WILF: Oh, 1948, I was over there. End of the Mandate in Palestine. Private
Mott. Skinny little idiot, I was. Stood on this rooftop, in the middle of a
skirmish. It was like a blizzard, all them bullets in the air. The world gone
mad. Yeah, you don't want to listen to an old man's tales, do you?  
DOCTOR: I'm older than you.  
WILF: Get away.  
DOCTOR: I'm nine hundred and six.  
WILF: What, really, though?  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
WILF: Nine hundred years. We must look like insects to you.  
DOCTOR: I think you look like giants.  
WILF: Listen, I, I want you to have this. I've kept it all this time, and I
thought  
(Wilf offers his revolver to the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: No.  
WILF: No, but if you take it, you could  
DOCTOR: No. You had that gun in the mansion. You could have shot the Master
there and then.  
WILF: Too scared, I suppose.  
DOCTOR: I'd be proud.  
WILF: Of what?  
DOCTOR: If you were my dad.  
WILF: Oh, come on, don't start. But you said, you were told he will knock four
times and then you die. Well, that's him, isn't it? The Master. That noise in
his head? The Master is going to kill you.  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
WILF: Then kill him first.  
DOCTOR: And that's how the Master started. It's not like I'm an innocent. I've
taken lives. I got worse. I got clever. Manipulated people into taking their
own. Sometimes I think a Time Lord lives too long. I can't. I just can't.  
WILF: If the Master dies, what happens to all the people?  
DOCTOR: I don't know.  
WILF: Doctor, what happens?  
DOCTOR: The template snaps.  
WILF: What, they go back to being human? They're alive, and human. Then don't
you dare, sir. Don't you dare put him before them. Now you take this. That's
an order, Doctor. Take the gun. You take the gun and save your life. And
please don't die. You're the most wonderful man and I don't want you to die.  
DOCTOR: Never.  
MASTER [OC]: A star fell from the sky.

**[Gate room]**

MASTER: Don't you want to know where from?

**[Flight deck]**

MASTER [OC]: Because now it makes sense, Doctor.  
ADDAMS: It's an open broadcast. Don't reply, or he'll know where we are.  
MASTER [OC]: The whole of my life.

**[Teleport room]**

MASTER [OC]: My destiny. The star was a diamond.

**[Gate room]**

MASTER: And the diamond is a Whitepoint

**[Teleport room]**

MASTER [OC]: Star. And I have worked all night to sanctify that gift.

**[Gate room]**

(Scientist-Masters are working on a gizmo.)  
MASTER: Now the star is mine. I can increase the signal and use it as a
lifeline. Do you get it now? Do you see? Keep watching, Doctor. This should be
spectacular.

**[Teleport room]**

MASTER [OC]: Over and out.  
WILF: What's he on about? What's he doing? Doctor, what does that mean?  
DOCTOR: A Whitepoint star is only found on one planet. Gallifrey. Which means
it's the Time Lords. The Time Lords are returning.  
WILF: Well, I mean, that's good, isn't it? I mean, that's your people.  
(The Doctor takes Wilf's revolver and runs.)

**[Gate room]**

MASTER: Open up the Nuclear Bolt. Infuse the power lines to maximum.  
(Two scientists swap duties in the glass booths.)  
TECHNICIAN-MASTER: Nuclear bolt accelerating, sir.  
MASTER: Send the signal back and the link becomes a pathway.  
(The Master places the diamond in a bed of wires within the gizmo. It begins
to transmit the four beats.)  
MASTER: Come home.

**[Flight deck]**

(The Doctor runs in. The signal can be heard here.)  
ADDAMS: What's that?  
ROSSITER: Coming from Earth. It's on every single wavelength.

**[Black void]**

RASSILON: Contact. At last.

**[Gate room]**

MASTER: We have contact.

**[Citadel]**

(The Lord President addresses the serried ranks of Time Lords.)  
RASSILON: Now the High Council of Time Lords must vote. Whether we die here,
today, or return to the waking world and complete the Ultimate Sanction. For
this is the hour when either Gallifrey falls, or Gallifrey rises!  
TIME LORDS: Gallifrey rises!  
RASSILON: Gallifrey rises!

**[Flight deck]**

(The Doctor is rushing around, working on bits and pieces.)  
WILF: But you said your people were dead. Past tense.  
DOCTOR: Inside the Time War. And the whole War was Timelocked. Like, sealed
inside a bubble. It's not a bubble but just think of a bubble. Nothing can get
in or get out of the Timelock. Don't you see? Nothing can get in or get out,
except something that was already there.  
WILF: The signal. Since he was a kid.  
DOCTOR: If they can follow the signal, they can escape before they die.  
WILF: Well, then, big reunion. We'll have a party.  
DOCTOR: There will be no party.  
WILF: But I've heard you talk about your people like they're wonderful.  
DOCTOR: That's how I choose to remember them, the Time Lords of old. But then
they went to war. An endless war, and it changed them right to the core.
You've seen my enemies, Wilf. The Time Lords are more dangerous than any of
them.  
ADDAMS: Time Lords, what lords? Anyone want to explain?  
DOCTOR: Right, yes, you. This is a salvage ship, yes? You go trawling the
asteroid fields for junk?  
ADDAMS: Yeah, what about it?  
DOCTOR: So, you've got asteroid lasers!  
ROSSITER: Yeah, but they're all frazzled.  
(The Doctor throws a lever and two gun alcoves open on either side of the
flight controls.)  
DOCTOR: Consider them unfrazzled. You there, what's your name? (Addams) I'm
going to need you on navigation. (to Rossiter) And you, get in the laser-pod.
Wilfred.  
WILF: Yeah?  
DOCTOR: Laser number two. The old soldier's got one more battle.  
ADDAMS: This ship can't move. It's dead!  
DOCTOR: Fix the heating?  
(The Doctor throws two levers forward, and the ship powers up.  
ADDAMS: But now they can see us.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes!

**[UNIT HQ Geneva]**

GENERAL-MASTER: Sir, we've got a fix. Hundred and five thousand miles in
orbit.

**[Flight deck]**

ADDAMS: This is my ship, and you're not moving it. Step away from the wheel.  
DOCTOR: There's an old Earth saying, Captain. A phrase of great power and
wisdom, and consolation to the soul in times of need.  
ADDAMS: What's that, then?  
DOCTOR: Allons-y!  
(The Doctor powers the spaceship down towards the Earth.)

**[UNIT HQ Geneva]**

OPERATIVE-MASTER: He's moving, sir.  
GENERAL-MASTER: Get a fix on him.  
OPERATIVE-MASTER: He's moving very fast.

**[Flight deck]**

(The spaceship dives through the atmosphere.)  
DOCTOR: Come on! Come on!  
ADDAMS: You are blinking, flipping mad.  
DOCTOR: You two. What did I say? Lasers.  
ROSSITER: What for?  
DOCTOR: Because of the missiles. We've got to fight off an entire planet.

**[Gate room]**

GENERAL-MASTER [on screen]: All NATO defences coordinated, sir, awaiting your
command.  
MASTER: I don't need him. Any second now, I'll have Time Lords to spare. Take
him out. Launch missiles!

**[UNIT HQ Geneva]**

GENERAL-MASTER: Launch missiles.  
OPERATIVE-MASTERS: Missiles launching in three, two one, zero.

**[Laser pods]**

(Wilf and Rossiter take their places in the transparent gunner's domes.)  
WILF: Hey! How does this thing work?  
ROSSITER: The tracking's automatic. Just deploy the trigger on the joystick.

**[Flight deck]**

ADDAMS: We've got incoming.  
ROSSITER: Look at this one! Oh, my God!  
DOCTOR: You two, open fire!  
(The Doctor skims the ocean, dodging the missiles.)  
ROSSITER: Oh, my word!  
WILF: Whoa. Whoa!  
ROSSITER: No, no, no, no, no!  
DOCTOR: Open fire! Come on, Wilf!  
(Wilf shoots down a missile.)  
WILF: Whoo! Oh, I wish Donna could see me now.

**[UNIT HQ Geneva]**

GENERAL-MASTER: Second wave. Launch missiles.  
OPERATIVE-MASTER: Yes, sir.

**[Flight deck]**

ADDAMS: And there's more. Sixteen of them. Oh, and another sixteen.  
DOCTOR: Then get on the rear gun lasers! You two, open fire! Now!  
ROSSITER: Yes!  
DOCTOR: No, you don't!  
(They keep destroying missiles.)  
WILF: Come on!  
DOCTOR: Come on! Fire!  
(The front window gets blown in.)  
WILF: Whoa! Wow!  
ROSSITER: Yes!  
DOCTOR: Lock the navigation.  
ADDAMS: Onto what?  
DOCTOR: England. The Naismith mansion.

**[Gate room]**

GENERAL-MASTER [on screen]: He's heading straight for you.  
MASTER: But too late. They are coming.

**[Black void]**

(The Lord President walks past two Time Lords who have their faces covered
with their hands. One man, one Woman. The Woman.)  
RASSILON: The vote is taken. Only two stand against, and will stand as
monument to their shame, like the Weeping Angels of old. Now the vanguard
stands prepared, as the children of Gallifrey return to the universe. To
Earth. (He raises his staff and they vanish in a bright light. The Gate fills
with that light.)

**[Flight deck]**

DOCTOR: Destination?  
ADDAMS: Fifty kliks and closing. We've locked on to the house. We are going to
stop, though. Doctor? We are going to stop?

**[Gate room]**

MASTER: Closer! And closer! And closer!

**[Flight deck]**

WILF: Doctor? Doctor, you said you were going to die.  
ADDAMS: He said what?  
WILF: But is that all of us? I won't stop you, sir. But is this it?

**[Gate room]**

(Naismith-Master is looking out of the window at the approaching spaceship.)  
NAISMITH-MASTER: I think I should warn you  
MASTER: Not now!  
(The Doctor pulls the spaceship's nose up at the last moment, then opens a
hatch in the floor and, with the revolver ready, jumps down through the glass
dome. He lands hard on the marble floor. He cannot hold the revolver and he
cannot stand up. The five Time Lords have arrived - the Gate has been replaced
by a white space with raised up two steps.)  
RASSILON: My Lord Doctor. My Lord Master. We are gathered for the end.

**[Flight deck]**

(Addams grabs the controls.)  
WILF: Just turn it round. Land it!  
ADDAMS: We are not going in there.  
WILF: I am not leaving that man on his own. Not today. Land it!

**[Gate room]**

DOCTOR: Listen to me. You can't!  
RASSILON: It is a fitting paradox that our salvation comes at the hands of our
most infamous child.  
DOCTOR: Oh, he's not saving you. Don't you realise what he's doing?  
MASTER: Hey, no, hey! That's mine. Hush. Look around you. I've transplanted
myself into every single human being. But who wants a mongrel little species
like them, because now I can transplant myself into every single Time Lord.
Oh, yes, Mister President, sir, standing there all noble and resplendent and
decrepit. Think how much better you're going to look as me.  
(The Lord President holds up his metal gauntlet. It glows and everyone who
looks like the Master goes through the head blur thing again.)  
MASTER: No, no, don't. No, no, stop it! No, no, no, don't!  
(Finally, everyone on Earth is restored to themselves.)  
RASSILON: On your knees, mankind.  
(The people obey.)  
MASTER: No, that's fine, that's good, because you said salvation. I still
saved you. Don't forget that.  
RASSILON: The approach begins.  
MASTER: Approach of what?  
DOCTOR: Something is returning. Don't you ever listen? That was the prophecy.
Not someone, something.  
MASTER: What is it?  
DOCTOR: They're not just bringing back the species. It's Gallifrey. Right
here, right now.  
(A big burning planet appears close to the Earth.)

**[Nobles' home]**

SHAUN: Donna. Where's Donna?  
(The tidal forces of the new planet make the Earth shake. Thinks fall off
shelves.)

**[Outside the Nobles' home]**

(People are panicking as Gallifrey fills the sky.)  
SHAUN: Donna? Donna! Donna!  
SYLVIA: Oh, Doctor. Please!

**[Flight deck]**

ADDAMS: We're getting out of here. This whole planet's going to be knocked out
of orbit.  
ROSSITER: What about the Doctor?  
ADDAMS: Well, he said he was dying.

**[Gate room]**

(The people run from the room.)  
MASTER: But, I did this. I get the credit. I'm on your side.  
(Wilf pushes his way in.)  
WILF: Come on, get out of the way. Get out of the way! Doctor?  
(A technician is hammering on the door of his locked glass booth.)  
TECHNICIAN: Help me, please. Somebody, please.  
WILF: All right! I've got you, mate. I've got you.  
(Wilf goes into the open booth.)  
DOCTOR: Wilf, don't. Don't!  
(Wilf unlocks the other booth.)  
WILF: I've got you. Come on. Go on.  
(The freed technician runs.)  
MASTER: But this is fantastic, isn't it? The Time Lords restored.  
DOCTOR: You weren't there in the final days of the War. You never saw what was
born. But if the Timelock's broken, then everything's coming through. Not just
the Daleks, but the Skaro Degradations, the Horde of Travesties, the Nightmare
Child, the Could-have-been King with his army of Meanwhiles and Never-weres.
The War turned into hell. And that's what you've opened, right above the
Earth. Hell is descending.  
MASTER: My kind of world.  
DOCTOR: Just listen! Because even the Time Lords can't survive that.  
RASSILON: We will initiate the Final Sanction. The end of time will come at my
hand. The rupture will continue until it rips the Time Vortex apart.  
MASTER: That's suicide.  
RASSILON: We will ascend to become creatures of consciousness alone. Free of
these bodies, free of time, and cause and effect, while creation itself ceases
to be.  
DOCTOR: You see now? That's what they were planning in the final days of the
War. I had to stop them.  
MASTER: Then, take me with you, Lord President. Let me ascend into glory.  
RASSILON: You are diseased, albeit a disease of our own making. No more.  
(The Doctor is on his feet, aiming the revolver at the Lord President.)  
RASSILON: Choose your enemy well. We are many. The Master is but one.  
MASTER: But he's the President. Kill him, and Gallifrey could be yours.  
(The Doctor turns and aims at the Master.)  
MASTER: He's to blame, not me. Oh, the link is inside my head. Kill me, the
link gets broken, they go back. You never would, you coward. Go on then. Do
it.  
(The Doctor aims at the Lord President again.)  
MASTER: Exactly. It's not just me, it's him. He's the link. Kill him!  
RASSILON: The final act of your life is murder. But which one of us?  
(Behind the Lord President, the Woman lowers her hands and looks over the
Doctor's shoulder. He turns back to face the Master.)  
DOCTOR: Get out of the way.  
(The Master moves and the Doctor shoots the diamond in its gizmo. The link
explodes and the Time Lords are sucked away.)  
DOCTOR: The link is broken. Back into the Time War, Rassilon. Back into hell.  
VISIONARY [OC]: Gallifrey falling! Gallifrey falls!  
RASSILON: You'll die with me, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: I know.  
(Rassilon aims his gauntlet at the Doctor. The Woman covers her face again.)  
MASTER: Get out of the way.  
(The Doctor steps back and the Master attacks the Lord President with his
energy.)  
MASTER: You did this to me! All of my life! You made me! One! Two! Three!
Four!  
(Rassilon is forced to his knees. The Time Lords and the Master disappear in a
bright light and Gallifrey fades away from the sky. The people rejoice.)  
DOCTOR: I'm alive. I've. There was. I'm still alive.  
(Knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock, knock, knock,
knock. Knock, knock, knock, knock.)  
WILF: They gone, then? Yeah, good-o. If you could let me out?  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
WILF: Only, this thing seems to be making a bit of a noise.  
DOCTOR: The Master left the Nuclear Bolt running. It's gone into overload.  
WILF: And that's bad, is it?  
DOCTOR: No, because all the excess radiation gets vented inside there.
Vinvocci glass contains it. All five hundred thousand rads, about to flood
that thing.  
WILF: Oh. Well, you'd better let me out, then.  
DOCTOR: Except it's gone critical. Touch one control and it floods. Even this
would set it off.  
(The sonic screwdriver.)  
WILF: I'm sorry.  
DOCTOR: Sure.  
WILF: Look, just leave me.  
DOCTOR: Okay, right then, I will. Because you had to go in there, didn't you?
You had to go and get stuck, oh yes. Because that's who you are, Wilfred. You
were always this. Waiting for me all this time.  
WILF: No really, just leave me. I'm an old man, Doctor. I've had my time.  
DOCTOR: Well, exactly. Look at you. Not remotely important. But me? I could do
so much more. So much more! But this is what I get. My reward. And it's not
fair! Oh. Oh. I've lived too long.  
WILF: No. No, no, please, please don't. No, don't! Please don't! Please!  
DOCTOR: Wilfred, it's my honour. Better be quick. Three, two, one.  
(The Doctor quickly goes into the open booth and unlocks Wilf's side. Wilf
runs out and red light floods the Doctor's booth. It hurts a lot. The Doctor
curls up into a ball. Then the power shuts down. After a few moments, the
Doctor gets up.)  
WILF: What? Hello.  
DOCTOR: Hi.  
WILF: Still with us?  
DOCTOR: The system's dead. I absorbed it all. Whole thing's kaput. Oh. Now it
opens, yeah.  
(The Doctor comes out of the booth.)  
WILF: Well, there we are, then. Safe and sound. Mind you, you're in hell of a
state. You've got some battle scars there.  
(The Doctor rubs his face and the cuts vanish.)  
WILF: But they've. Your face. How did you do that?  
DOCTOR: It's started.  
(Wilf hugs the Doctor.)

**[Nobles' home]**

(Donna is out cold on the settee.)  
SHAUN: It's no good. She's freezing. How long was she lying there? It's like
hypothermia. Try them again.  
SYLVIA: I did, it's engaged. Everyone's dialling 999. I can't get through.  
SHAUN: We've got to do something. Wake her up. Donna? Can you hear me? Donna?  
(Sylvia hears the sound of the Tardis materialising outside. Donna opens her
eyes.)  
SHAUN: Donna? It's me. I'm here. You're safe. You're home.  
DONNA: But I was. What happened? Did I miss something again?

**[Outside the Noble's home]**

(Sylvia runs to the front door and sees Wilf and the Doctor come out of the
Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, she's smiling. As if today wasn't bad enough. Anyway, don't go
thinking this is goodbye, Wilf. I'll see you again, one more time.  
WILF: What do you mean? When's that?  
DOCTOR: Just keep looking. I'll be there.  
WILF: Where are you going?  
DOCTOR: To get my reward.

**[Abandoned factory]**

(Martha and Mickey Smith are running from explosions.)  
MICKEY: I told you to stay behind.  
MARTHA: Well, you looked like you needed help. Besides, you're the one who
persuaded me to go freelance.  
MICKEY: Yeah, but we're being fired at by a Sontaran. A dumpling with a gun.
And this is no place for a married woman.  
MARTHA: Well then, You shouldn't have married me.  
(A Sontaran - Commander Jask, apparently - is on a catwalk behind them with a
clear shot, when the Doctor hits him on the probic vent with a hammer. )  
MICKEY: If we go in here and down to the factory floor, and down past that
corridor, then he won't know that we're here.  
MARTHA: Mickey.  
(She sees the Doctor on the catwalk.)  
MARTHA: Mickey.  
MICKEY: Hey!  
(They hug to the sound of the Tardis dematerialising.)

**[Bannerman Road]**

(Young Luke Smith is on the phone.)  
LUKE: That was the maddest Christmas ever, Clive. Mum still doesn't know what
happened. She got Mister Smith to put out this story saying that Wi-Fi went
mad all across the world, giving everyone hallucinations. I mean, how else do
you explain it? Everyone with a different face  
(Luke crosses the road without looking, and the Doctor drags him away from
being run down.)  
LUKE: But it's you! You're  
(The Doctor walks back to the Tardis.)  
LUKE: Mum! Mum!  
SARAH: What? What is it?  
LUKE: It's him. It's the Doctor.  
(The Doctor waves goodbye.)

**[Alien bar]**

(Complete with Raxacoricofallapatorian, Graske, and a little Adipose. Jack
Harkness is drinking alone and that Murray Gold song is being sung.)  
JUDOON: Cho no fro jo ko fo to do.  
SINGER: I'm a country girl, I ain't see a lot, but you came along and my heart
went pop. You took a little street car to my heart  
(The barman puts a piece of paper in front of Jack.)  
BARMAN: From the man over there.  
(Jack looks up and sees the Doctor.)  
SINGER: And an apple of love fell off my apple cart. You looked at me, my
heart began to pound. You weren't the sort of guy I thought would stick
around.  
(The paper says, his name is Alonso. A young man in Edwardian naval uniform
sits next to Jack.)  
SINGER: Hey, but it don't have to be eternally. My bad, bad angel put the
Devil in me! You put the Devil in me.  
(Jack salutes the Doctor then turns to the young man.)  
SINGER: You lured me in with your cold grey eyes.  
JACK: So, Alonso, going my way?  
ALONSO: How do you know my name?  
JACK: I'm kind of psychic.  
ALONSO: Really?  
JACK: Yeah.  
ALONSO: Do you know what I'm thinking right now?  
JACK: Oh, yeah.  
SINGER: My bad, bad angel, you put the devil in me.

**[Bookshop]**

VERITY: No, it's not just a story, no. Every word of it's true. I found my
great grandmother's diary in the loft, and she was a nurse in 1913, and she
fell in love with this man called John Smith. Except he was a visitor from
another world. She fell in love with a man from the stars. And she wrote it
all down.  
(She signs the book for the young man. A Journal of Impossible Things, by
Verity Newman, who is the spitting image of her great-grandmother Joan
Redfern)  
MAN: Thank you.  
(The next book is presented for signing.)  
VERITY: And who's it for?  
DOCTOR: The Doctor.  
VERITY: To the Doctor. Funny, that's the name he used.  
(She looks up at him.)  
DOCTOR: Was she happy in the end?  
VERITY: Yes. Yes, she was. Were you?

**[Outside a church]**

(The bells are ringing for the end of a wedding ceremony. Donna and Shaun are
married.)  
WILF: You look lovely. Come here.  
(He kisses them both.)  
WILF: Everybody, three cheers. Hip, hip  
ALL: Hooray!  
WILF: Hip, hip  
ALL: Hooray!  
WILF: Hip, hip  
ALL: Hooray!  
DONNA: Right, come on then, you lot. This photo is just with friends. Come on.
And I want all of you in it. Come on. That's it. Well, friends, and Nerys. Oh,
I'm only joking. Oh, look at her.  
NERYS: You made me wear peach.  
DONNA: That's because you are a peach. Furry skin, stone inside, going off.  
PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, smile.  
ALL: Cheese!  
MINNIE: How about it, Wilfred?  
WILF: Eh?  
MINNIE: Well, it's never too late.  
WILF: Will you behave, Minnie. Honestly.  
MINNIE: I'm going to catch that bouquet.  
WILF: Oh, dear.  
(Sylvia sees the Doctor and the Tardis just outside the lych gate.)  
SYLVIA: Dad.  
(They go over to him.)  
WILF: And here you are, eh? Same old face. Didn't I tell you you'd be all
right? Oh! They've arrested Mister Naismith. It was on the news. Crimes
undisclosed. And his daughter. Both of them, locked up. But I keep thinking,
Doctor, there's one thing you never told me. That woman. Who was she?  
DOCTOR: I just wanted to give you this. Wedding present. Thing is, I never
carry money, so I just popped back in time, borrowed a quid off a really
lovely man. Geoffrey Noble, his name was. Have it, he said. Have that on me.  
(Sylvia is nearly in tears.)  
PHOTOGRAPHER: Smile!  
(Wilf gives the envelope to Donna.)  
DONNA: Oh, don't tell me, it's a bill. Just what I need, right now. A lottery
ticket? What a cheap present. Who was that? Still, you never know. It's a
triple rollover this week. I might get lucky. Oi, Shaun! Come on, we're on a
tight schedule. Oxtail soup at two thirty.  
(Wilf salutes the Doctor before he leaves.)

**[Powell Estate]**

ROSE: I'm late now. I've missed it. It's midnight. Mickey's going to be
calling me everything. This is your fault.  
JACKIE: No, it's not. It's Jimbo. He said he was going to give us a lift, then
he said his axle broke. I can't help it.  
ROSE: Get rid of him, Mum. He's useless.  
JACKIE: Listen to you, with a mechanic. Be fair, though. My time of life I'm
not going to do much better.  
ROSE: Don't be like that. You never know. There could be someone out there.  
JACKIE: Maybe, one day. Happy New Year.  
ROSE: Happy New Year! Don't stay out all night.  
JACKIE: Try and stop me.  
(They walk in opposite directions. Rose turns when she hears the Doctor grunt
with pain.)  
ROSE: You all right, mate?  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
ROSE: Too much to drink?  
DOCTOR: Something like that.  
ROSE: Maybe it's time you went home.  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
ROSE: Anyway, Happy New Year.  
DOCTOR: And you. What year is this?  
ROSE: Blimey, how much have you had? 2005, January the first.  
DOCTOR: 2005. Tell you what. I bet you're going to have a really great year.  
ROSE: Yeah? See you.  
(Rose runs off. The Doctor staggers painfully back towards the Tardis.)  
SIGMA: We will sing to you, Doctor. The universe will sing you to your sleep.
This song is ending, but the story never ends.

**[Tardis]**

(Golden energy streams from his hand. He sets the Tardis going.)  
DOCTOR: I don't want to go.  
(The golden energy regenerates David Tennant, and starts a lot of fires in the
Tardis. He turns into a gangly hyperactive drink of water with a long fringe
of hair dangling over one eye. Well, I suppose at least  Matt Smith does look
slightly alien.)  
DOCTOR: Legs. I've still got legs. Good. Arms. Hands. Ooo, fingers. Lots of
fingers. Ears, yes. Eyes, two. Nose, I've had worse. Chin, blimey. Hair. I'm a
girl! No. No. I'm not a girl. And still not ginger. And something else.
Something important. I'm, I'm, I'm  
(Bang!)  
DOCTOR: Ha! Crashing!  
(The Tardis is plummeting back down to Earth.)  
DOCTOR: Ha, ha! Whoo hoo hoo! Ah! Geronimo!
