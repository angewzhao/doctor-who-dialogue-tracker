**Doomsday**  
  
Original Airdate: 8 Jul, 2006  

**[Sphere laboratory]**

(The Daleks have landed and are trundling across the floor.)  
DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!  
ROSE: Daleks! You're called Daleks. I know your name. Think about it how can I
know that? A human who knows about the Daleks and the Time War. If you want to
know how, then keep us alive. That's all I'm asking. Me and my friends.  
MICKEY: Yeah, Daleks. Time War. Me too.  
RAJESH: Yeah. And me.  
BLACK DALEK: You will be necessary. Report. What is the status of the Genesis
Ark?  
(The four Daleks have a contraption behind them.)  
DALEK: Status, hibernation.  
BLACK DALEK: Commence awakening. The Genesis Ark must be protected above all
else.  
MICKEY: The Daleks. You said they were all dead.  
ROSE: Never mind that. What the hell's a Genesis Ark?

**[Yvonne's office]**

JACKIE: What's down there? She was in that room with the sphere. What's
happened to Rose?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. I'll find her. I brought you here, I'll get you both
out, you and your daughter. Jackie, look at me. Look at me. I promise you. I
give you my word.  
CYBERLEADER: You will talk to your central world authority and order global
surrender.  
YVONNE: Oh, do some research. We haven't got a central world authority.  
CYBERLEADER: You have now. I will speak on all global wavelengths. This
broadcast is for human kind.  
(The Doctor puts on his 3D spectacles.)  
CYBERLEADER [on TV]: Cybermen now occupy every land mass on this planet, but
you need not fear. Cybermen will remove fear. Cybermen will remove sex and
class and colour and creed. You will become identical. You will become like
us.  
(Panic stations. The army sets up roadblocks and tries shooting at the
Cybermen. A bazooka blows a Cyberman to bits. London burns.)  
CYBERLEADER: I ordered surrender.  
DOCTOR: They're not taking instructions. Don't you understand? You're on every
street, you're in their homes, you've got their children! Of course they're
going to fight.

**[Sphere laboratory]**

BLACK DALEK: Which of you is least important?  
ROSE: What's that supposed to mean?  
BLACK DALEK: Which of you is least important?  
ROSE: No, we don't work like that. None of us.  
BLACK DALEK: Designate the least important!  
RAJESH: This is my responsibility.  
ROSE: No, you don't.  
RAJESH: I er, I represent the Torchwood Institute. Anything you need, you come
through me. Leave these two alone.  
BLACK DALEK: You will kneel.  
RAJESH: What for?  
BLACK DALEK: Kneel.  
(Rajesh kneels with his back to the Black Dalek.)  
BLACK DALEK: The Daleks need information about current Earth history.  
RAJESH: Yeah, well, I can give you a certain amount of intelligence but
nothing that will compromise Homeland security.  
BLACK DALEK: Speech is not necessary. We will extract brainwaves.  
(Three Dalek sink plungers envelop Rajesh's head.)  
RAJESH: Don't I I'll tell you everything you need. No. No!  
(He screams.)

**[Lever room]**

CYBERLEADER: Scans detect unknown technology active within Sphere chamber.  
CYBERMAN: Cybermen will investigate.  
CYBERLEADER: Units ten six five and ten six six will investigate Sphere
chamber.  
CYBERMEN: We obey.

**[Sphere laboratory]**

(The dry, dusty and rapidly aged corpse of Rajesh drops to the floor.)  
BLACK DALEK: His mind spoke of a second species invading Earth infected by the
superstition of ghosts.  
ROSE: You didn't need to kill him!  
DALEK 3: Neither did we need him alive.  
BLACK DALEK: Dalek Thay, investigate outside.  
DALEK 2: I obey.  
(Note- each Dalek has a slightly different logo by its eyestalk.)

**[Yvonne's office]**

CYBERLEADER: Units open visual link.  
(A Cyberman's view comes up on Yvonne's laptop.)  
CYBERLEADER: Visual contact established.

**[Sphere laboratory]**

BLACK DALEK: Establish visual contact. Lower communications barrier.  
(A big viewscreen appears where the sphere had been.)  

**[Yvonne's office]**

DALEK 2 [on laptop]: Identify yourselves.

**[Sphere laboratory]**

CYBERMAN [on viewscreen]: You will identify first.

**[Yvonne's office]**

DALEK 2 [on laptop]: State your identity.

**[Corridor]**

CYBERMAN: You will identify first.  
DALEK 2: Identify!

**[Sphere laboratory]**

MICKEY: It's like Stephen Hawkins meets the Speaking Clock.

**[Corridor]**

CYBERMAN: That answer is (??) and illogical. You will modify.  
DALEK 2: Daleks do not take orders.  
CYBERMAN: You have identified as Daleks.

**[Sphere laboratory]**

BLACK DALEK: Outline resembles the inferior species known as Cybermen.

**[Yvonne's office]**

JACKIE: (sotto) Rose said about the Daleks. She was terrified of them. What
have they done to her, Doctor? Is she dead?  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Phone.  
JACKIE: (sotto) What?  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Phone!  
CYBERMAN [OC]: We followed in the wake of your sphere.  
(The Doctor phones Rose.)

**[Sphere laboratory]**

BLACK DALEK: Long range scans confirm the presence of crude cybernetic
constructs on worldwide scale.  
(Rose answers her phone.)

**[Yvonne's office]**

DOCTOR: She's answered. She's alive. Why haven't they killed her?  
JACKIE: Well, don't complain!  
DOCTOR: They must need her for something.

**[Sphere laboratory]**

DALEK 3: We must protect the Genesis Ark.

**[Yvonne's office]**

DOCTOR: The Genesis Ark?  
CYBERMAN [on laptop]: Our species our similar, though your design is
inelegant.  
(The Doctor looks at the scene on the laptop through his 3D spectacles.)

**[Corridor]**

DALEK 2: Daleks have no concept of elegance.  
CYBERMAN: This is obvious. But consider, our technologies are compatible.

**[Yvonne's office]**

CYBERMAN [on laptop]: Cybermen plus Daleks.

**[Corridor]**

CYBERMAN: Together, we could upgrade the Universe.  
DALEK 2: You propose an alliance?

**[Yvonne's office]**

CYBERMAN [on laptop]: This is correct.

**[Corridor]**

DALEK 2: Request denied.  
(The Cybermen ready their weapons.)  
CYBERMAN: Hostile elements will be deleted.  
(They shoot at the Dalek.)  
DALEK 2: Exterminate!  
(Dalek 2, Cybermen 0)

**[Yvonne's office]**

CYBERLEADER: Open visual link.

**[Sphere laboratory]**

CYBERLEADER [on viewscreen]: Daleks, be warned. You have declared war upon the
Cybermen.

**[Yvonne's office]**

BLACK DALEK [on laptop]: This is not war. This is pest control.  
CYBERLEADER: We have five million Cybermen. How many are you?

**[Sphere laboratory]**

BLACK DALEK: Four.  
CYBERLEADER [on viewscreen]: You would destroy the Cybermen with four Daleks?  
BLACK DALEK: We would destroy the Cybermen with one Dalek.

**[Yvonne's office]**

BLACK DALEK [on laptop]: You are superior in only one respect.  
CYBERLEADER: What is that?

**[Sphere laboratory]**

BLACK DALEK: You are better at dying. Raise communications barrier!  
(The Doctor is visible behind the CyberLeader just before the viewscreen goes
blank.) DALEK 3: Wait!

**[Yvonne's office]**

DOCTOR: Lost her.

[Sphere laboratory]

DALEK 3: Rewind image by nine rells. Identify grid seven gamma frame. This
male registers as enemy.  
BLACK DALEK: The female's heartbeat has increased.  
MICKEY: Yeah, tell me about it.  
BLACK DALEK: Identify him.  
ROSE: All right, then. If you really want to know, that's the Doctor.  
(The Black Dalek rolls back a bit.)  
ROSE: Five million Cybermen, easy. One Doctor? Now you're scared.

**[Yvonne's office]**

CYBERLEADER: Quarantine the Sphere chamber. Start emergency upgrading. Begin
with these personnel.  
(The Cybermen take Yvonne and Jackie.)  
YVONNE: No, you can't do this! We surrendered! We surrendered!  
CYBERMAN: This one. His increased adrenaline suggests that he has vital Dalek
information.  
JACKIE: Stop them! I don't want to go! You promised me! You gave me your word!  
DOCTOR: I demand you leave that woman alone! I won't help you if you hurt her.
Jackie, don't fight. I'll think of something.

**[Sphere laboratory]**

(The victorious Dalek returns.)  
DALEK 2: Cyber threat irrelevant. Concentrate on the Genesis Ark.  
(The Genesis Ark is a Dalek shaped copper container.)  
MICKEY: Why are we being kept alive?  
ROSE: They might need me.  
MICKEY: What? What is it?

**[Unoccupied floor]**

(Beyond the plastic sheets, sparks fly and people scream.)  
JACKIE: What happens in there? What's upgrading mean? What do they do?  
YVONNE: I think they remove the brain. Sorry. I think they remove the brain
and they put it in a suit of armour. That's what these things are. They're us.  
CYBERMAN: Next.  
JACKIE: This is your fault. You and your Torchwood. You've killed us all!  
(Yvonne is taken away.)  
YVONNE: I did my duty for Queen and Country. I did my duty. I did my duty. Oh,
God. I did my duty.  
(Yvonne walks forward. Sparks fly and she screams.)

**[Yvonne's office]**

CYBERLEADER: You are proof.  
DOCTOR: Of what?  
CYBERLEADER: That emotions destroy you.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, I am. Mind you, I quite like hope. Hope's a good emotion. And
here it comes.  
(A group of black-clad commandoes pop into existence and take out the
remaining Cybermen in the Lever room The CyberLeader walks out of the office
and gets zapped too. It's head explodes.)  
JAKE: Doctor? Good to see you again.  
DOCTOR: Jake?  
JAKE: The Cybermen came through from one world to another, and so did we.

**[Unoccupied floor]**

(Jackie is being dragged forward.)  
JACKIE: No! No!  
CYBERMAN: CyberLeader One has been terminated.  
CYBERMAN 2: Explain. Download shared files.  
(Jackie sneaks away while they communicate.)  
CYBERMAN: I will be upgraded to CyberLeader.  
(Jackie runs into the stairwell and heads down.)

**[Lever room]**

(The Doctor has been using his 3D spectacles again.)  
JAKE: Defend this room. Chrissie, monitor communications. Kill one CyberLeader
and they just download into another. Move!  
(The commandoes run off.)  
DOCTOR: You can't just, just, just hop from one world to another. You can't.  
JAKE: We just did. With these.  
(Large yellow medallions on chains around their necks. He throws one to the
Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: But that's impossible. You can't have this sort of technology.  
JAKE: We've got our own version of Torchwood. They developed it. Do you want
to come and see?  
(Jake presses his own button.)  
DOCTOR: No!  (The Doctor and Jake vanish.)

**[Parallel Torchwood]**

(It's a wreck.)  
JAKE: Parallel Earth, parallel Torchwood. Except we found out what the
Institute was doing and the People's Republic took control.  
DOCTOR: I've got to get back. Rose is in danger, and her mother.  
PETE: That'd be Jackie. My wife in a parallel universe. And as for you,
Doctor, at least this time I know who you are.  
DOCTOR: Right, yes, fine, hooray. But I've got to get back, right now.  
PETE: No, you're not in charge here. This is our world, not yours. And you're
going to listen for once.

**[Sphere laboratory]**

MICKEY: I could transport out of here, but it only carries one and I'm not
leaving you.  
ROSE: You'd follow me anywhere. What did I do to you all those years ago?  
MICKEY: Guess I'm just stupid.  
ROSE: You're the bravest man I've ever met.  
MICKEY: What about the Doctor?  
ROSE: Oh, all right. Bravest human.  
MICKEY: Well, I can't think what the Daleks need with me. I'm nothing to them.  
ROSE: You could be. Whatever's inside that Ark is waking up, and I've seen
this happen before.  
(Rose remembers her meeting with the chained last Dalek.)  
ROSE [OC]: The first time I saw a Dalek, it was broken. It was dying. But I
touched it. The moment I did that, I brought it back to life.  
ROSE: As the Doctor said, when you travel in time in the Tardis, you soak up
all this background radiation. It's harmless. It's just there. But in the Time
War, the Daleks evolved so they could use it as a power supply.  
MICKEY: I love it when you talk technical.  
ROSE: Shut up. If the Daleks have got something inside that thing, and it
needs waking up.  
MICKEY: They need you.  
ROSE: You've travelled in time. Either one of us would do.  
MICKEY: But why would they build something they can't open themselves?  
BLACK DALEK: The technology is stolen. The Ark is not of Dalek design.  
ROSE: Then who built it?  
BLACK DALEK: The Time Lords. This is all that survives of their Home World.  
ROSE: What's inside?  
BLACK DALEK: The future.

**[Parallel Torchwood]**

PETE: When you left this world, you warned us there'd be more Cybermen. So we
sealed them inside the factories.  
JAKE: Except people argued. Said they were living. We should help them.  
PETE: And the debate went on. But all that time, the Cybermen made plans.
Infiltrated this version of Torchwood, mapped themselves onto your world, and
then vanished.  
DOCTOR: When was this?  
PETE: Three years ago.  
DOCTOR: It's taken them three years to cross the void, but we can pop to and
fro in a second. Must be the sheer mass of five million Cybermen crossing all
at once.  
PETE: Yeah, Mickey said you'd rattle off that sort of stuff.  
DOCTOR: Oh, where is the Mickey boy?  
PETE: He went ahead first. Any chance to go and find Miss Rose Tyler.  
DOCTOR: She's your daughter. You do know that? Did Mickey explain?  
PETE: She's not mine. She's the child of a dead man. Look at it, a world of
peace. They're calling this The Golden Age.  
DOCTOR: Who's the President now?  
PETE: A woman called Harriet Jones.  
DOCTOR: Oof. I'd keep an eye on her.  
PETE: But it's a lie. Temperatures have risen by two degrees in the past six
months. The ice caps are melting. They're saying all this is going to be
flooded. That's not just global warming, is it?  
DOCTOR: No.  
PETE: It's the breach.  
DOCTOR: I've been trying to tell you. Travel between parallel worlds is
impossible. Then the Daleks break down the walls with a Sphere.  
PETE: Daleks?  
DOCTOR: Then the Cybermen travelled across, then you lot. Those discs. Every
time you jump from one reality to another, you rip a hole in the universe.
This planet is starting to boil. Keep going and both worlds will fall into the
Void.  
PETE: But you can stop it? The famous Doctor. You can seal the breach?  
DOCTOR: Leaving five million Cybermen stranded on my Earth.  
PETE: That's your problem. I'm protecting this world, and this world only.  
DOCTOR: Hmm. Pete Tyler. I knew you when you were dead. Now here you are,
fighting the fight alone. There is a chance, back on my world, Jackie Tyler
might still be alive.  
PETE: My wife died.  
DOCTOR: Her husband died. Good match.  
PETE: There's more important things at stake. Doctor, help us.  
DOCTOR: What, close the breach? Stop the Cybermen? Defeat the Daleks? Do you
believe I can do that?  
PETE: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Maybe that's all I need. Off we go, then!

**[Lever room]**

(The Doctor, Jake and Pete appear.)  
DOCTOR: First of all, I need to make a phone call. You don't mind?  
JAKE: You two, guard to door.

**[Stairwell]**

(Jackie answers her phone.)  
JACKIE: Oh, my God, help me.

**[Yvonne's office]**

DOCTOR: Jackie, you're alive. Listen.  
JACKIE [OC]: They tried to download me but I ran away!  
DOCTOR: Shush. Listen, tell me. Where are you?

**[Stairwell]**

JACKIE: I don't know. Staircase.

**[Yvonne's office]**

DOCTOR: Yeah, which one? Is there any sort of sign? Anything to identify it?  
JACKIE [OC]: Yes, a fire extinguisher.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, that helps

**[Stairwell]**

JACKIE: Oh, wait a minute. It says N3.

**[Yvonne's office]**

DOCTOR: North corner, staircase three. Just keep low, we're trying our best.

**[Stairwell]**

JACKIE: No, don't leave me.

**[Yvonne's office]**

DOCTOR: I've got to go. I'm sorry.  
(The Doctor puts the phone down.)  
DOCTOR: Jacqueline Andrea Suzette Tyler.  
PETE: She's not my wife.  
DOCTOR: I was at the wedding. You got her name wrong. Now then, Jakey boy, if
I can open up the bonding chamber on this thing, it'll work on polycarbite.  
JAKE: What's polycarbite?  
DOCTOR: Skin of a Dalek.

**[Corridor]**

(A piece of A4 paper on a pointer is waved from around the corner.)  
DOCTOR: Sorry. No white flag. I only had a sheet of A4. Same difference.  
CYBERMAN: Do you surrender?  
DOCTOR: I surrender unto you. A very good idea.

**[Sphere laboratory]**

(The four Daleks disconnect from the Ark.)  
DALEK: Final stage of awakening.  
BLACK DALEK: Your handprint will open the Ark.  
ROSE: Well tough, because I'm not doing it.  
BLACK DALEK: Obey or the male will die.  
ROSE: I can't let them.  
MICKEY: Rose, don't.  
BLACK DALEK: Place your hand upon the casket.  
ROSE: All right! You're going to kill us anyway, so what the hell? If you er,
escaped the Time War, don't you want to know what happened?  
BLACK DALEK: Place your hand  
ROSE: What happened to the Emperor?  
BLACK DALEK: The Emperor survived?  
ROSE: Till he met me. Because if these are going to be my last words, then
you're going to listen. I met the Emperor, and I took the Time Vortex and I
pulled it into his head and turned him into dust. Do you get that? The God of
all Daleks, and I destroyed him. Ha!  
BLACK DALEK: You will be exterminated!  
(The Doctor is wearing his 3D spectacles again.)  
DOCTOR: Oh now, hold on, wait a minute.  
BLACK DALEK: Alert, alert. You are the Doctor.  
DALEK: Sensors report he is unarmed.  
DOCTOR: That's me. Always.  
BLACK DALEK: Then you are powerless.  
DOCTOR: Not me. Never. How are you?  
ROSE: Oh, same old, you know.  
DOCTOR: Good. And Mickity McMickey. Nice to see you!  
MICKEY: And you, boss.  
DALEK: Social interaction will cease!  
BLACK DALEK: How did you survive the Time War?  
DOCTOR: By fighting. On the front line. I was there at the fall of Arcadia.
Someday I might even come to terms with that. But you lot ran away!  
BLACK DALEK: We had to survive.  
DOCTOR: The last four Daleks in existence. So what's so special about you?  
ROSE: Doctor, they've got names. I mean, Daleks don't have names, do they? One
of them said they  
DALEK: I am Dalek Thay.  
BLACK DALEK: Dalek Sek.  
DALEK 3: Dalek Jast.  
DALEK 2: Dalek Caan.  
DOCTOR: So that's it! At last. The Cult of Skaro. I thought you were just a
legend.  
ROSE: Who are they?  
DOCTOR: A secret order above and beyond the Emperor himself. Their job was to
imagine, think as the enemy thinks. Even dared to have names. All to find new
ways of killing.  
MICKEY: But that thing, they said it was yours. I mean, Time Lords. They built
it. What does it do?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. Never seen it before.  
ROSE: But it's Time Lord.  
DOCTOR: Both sides had secrets. What is it? What have you done?  
BLACK DALEK: Time Lord science will restore Dalek supremacy.  
DOCTOR: What does that mean? What sort of Time Lord science? What do you mean?  
ROSE: They said one touch from a time traveller will wake it up.  
DOCTOR: Technology using the one thing a Dalek can't do. Touch. Sealed inside
your casing. Not feeling anything ever, from birth to death, locked inside a
cold metal cage. Completely alone. That explains your voice. No wonder you
scream.  
BLACK DALEK: The Doctor will open the Ark!  
DOCTOR: The Doctor will not.  
BLACK DALEK: You have no way of resisting.  
DOCTOR: Well, you got me there. Although there is always this.  
BLACK DALEK: A sonic probe?  
DOCTOR: That's screwdriver.  
BLACK DALEK: It is harmless.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word. That's why I like it. Doesn't
kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do. It is
very good at opening doors.  
(The door to the laboratory blows in. Enter Jake and a Cyberman with all guns
blazing.)  
CYBERMAN: Delete! Delete! Delete! Delete!  
DALEK 3: Alert. Casing impaired. Casing impaired.  
DOCTOR: Rose, get out!  
BLACK DALEK: Fire power insufficient! Fire power insufficient!  
(Rose stumbles. Pete helps her up.)  
PETE: Come on.  
(Mickey dives for his big gun.)  
CYBERMAN: Daleks will be deleted. Delete. Delete.  
ROSE: Mickey, come on!  
DALEK 3: Adapt to weaponry.  
BLACK DALEK: Fire power restored!  
(And kills a Cyberman. Mickey gets jostled and he puts out his hand to steady
himself. It touches the Ark. He and Jake join the Doctor, Rose and Pete at an
emergency blast door.)  
BLACK DALEK: Cybermen primary target.

**[Corridor]**

(The Doctor closes the blast door.)  
DOCTOR: Jake, check the stairwell. The rest of you, come on.

**[Sphere chamber]**

(The Ark is steaming.)  
BLACK DALEK: Cybermen have been exterminated. Daleks are supreme.  
DALEK 2: The Genesis Ark is primed.  
BLACK DALEK: The Ark needs area of thirteen square miles. Move!  
DALEK 2: Genesis Ark mobile.

**[Corridor]**

MICKEY: I just fell, I didn't mean it!  
DOCTOR: Mickey, without us, they'd have opened it by force. To do that, they'd
have blown up the sun. You've done us a favour. Now, run!

**[Corridor 2]**

(Jackie is trapped between two squads of Cybermen on the stairs, so she runs
into a corridor and meets two more.)  
CYBERMAN: You will be upgraded.  
JACKIE: No, but you can't. Please.  
(The Cybermen are shot down from behind.)  
JACKIE: Pete?  
PETE: Hello, Jacks.  
JACKIE: I said there were ghosts, but that's not fair. Why him?  
PETE: I'm not a ghost.  
JACKIE: But you're dead. You died twenty years ago, Pete.  
DOCTOR: It's Pete from a different universe. There are parallel worlds,
Jackie. Every single decision we make creates a parallel existence, a
different dimension where  
JACKIE: Oh, you can shut up. Oh, you look old.  
PETE: You don't.  
JACKIE: How can you be standing there?  
PETE: I just got lucky. Lived my life. You were left on your own. You didn't
marry again, or  
JACKIE: There was never anyone else. Twenty years, though. Look at me. I never
left that flat. Did nothing with myself.  
PETE: You brought her up. Rose Tyler. That's not bad.  
JACKIE: Yeah.  
PETE: In my world, it worked. All those daft little plans of mine, they
worked. Made me rich.  
JACKIE: I don't care about that. How rich?  
PETE: Very.  
JACKIE: I don't care about that. How very?  
PETE: Thing is though, Jacks, you're not my wife. I'm sorry, but you're not. I
mean, we both. You know, it's just sort of. Oh, come here.  
(He puts down the gun and she runs into his arms.)

**[Warehouse]**

(The Daleks burst through the door.)  
BLACK DALEK: Exterminate!  
CYBERMEN: Delete. Delete.  
(The two sides open fire.)  
DALEK: Exterminate.  
CYBERMAN: Delete.  
SOLDIER: Everyone get down.  
(The Torchwood security join in the fight.)  
DALEK: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
CYBERMAN: Delete.  
(The Cybermen don't stand a chance as the Daleks glide through with the Ark.)  
SOLDIER: Get down! Get down!  
CYBERLEADER: Emergency. All units will converge on the Torchwood Tower.
Repeat. All Cybermen to Torchwood.  
(Cybermen in the street start marching, leaving the humans alone.  
The Doctor looks carefully inside the warehouse, then crawls over to a crate
and grabs a pair of Magnaclamps before dodging laser fire to get back.)  
ROSE: Come on, please.  
SOLDIER: Cover me.  
(The Doctor looks back in again with his 3D glasses.)  
BLACK DALEK: Override roof mechanism.  
(The warehouse roof shutters start to slide back.)  
BLACK DALEK: Elevate.  
ROSE: What're they doing? Why do they need to get outside??  
DOCTOR: Time Lord science. What Time Lord science? What is it?  
(The Ark and the Black Dalek glide up and out into Canary Wharf.)

**[Corridor]**

DOCTOR: We've got to see what it's doing. We've got to go back up. Come on!
All of you. top floor!  
JACKIE: That's forty five floors up! Believe me, I've done them all.  
JAKE: We could always take the lift.

**[Midair]**

BLACK DALEK: The Genesis Ark will open.  
(The Ark contains another Dalek. It starts to spin around.)

**[Yvonne's office]**

(The Doctor gets to the window in time to see the Ark shooting out Daleks in
all directions as it spins around.)  
DOCTOR: Time Lord science. It's bigger on the inside.  
MICKEY: Did the Time Lords put those Daleks in there? What for?  
DOCTOR: It's a prison ship.  
ROSE: How many Daleks?  
DOCTOR: Millions.  
(The Daleks spread out over London as Cybermen clomp their way through the
streets before stopping and shooting into the sky.)

**[Midair]**

BLACK DALEK: Exterminate all life forms below. Exterminate!  
(So people get killed as well as the Cybermen.)

**[Lever room]**

PETE: I'm sorry, but you've had it. This world's going to crash and burn.
There's nothing we can do. We're going home.  
(Pete takes a yellow medallion from a commando.)  
PETE: Jacks, take this. You're coming with us.  
JACKIE: But they're destroying the city.  
PETE: I'd forgotten you could argue. It's not just London, it's the whole
world. But there's another world just waiting for you, Jacks. And it's safe as
long as the Doctor closes the breach. Doctor?  
(The Doctor turns around, wearing his 3D spectacles.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm ready. I've got the equipment right here. Thank you,
Torchwood.  
(The Doctor uses a computer terminal.)  
DOCTOR: Slam it down and close off both universes.  
COMPUTER: Reboot systems.  
ROSE: But we can't just leave. What about the Daleks? And the Cybermen?  
DOCTOR: They're part of the problem, and that makes them part of the solution.
Oh yes! Well? Isn't anyone going to ask what is it with the glasses?  
ROSE: What is it with the glasses?  
DOCTOR: I can see, that's what. because we've got two separate worlds, but in
between the two separate worlds, we've got the Void. That's where the Daleks
were hiding. And the Cybermen travelled through the Void to get here. And you
lot, one world to another, via the Void. Oh, I like that. Via the Void. Look.  
(He gives the spectacles to Rose.)  
DOCTOR: I've been through it. Do you see?  
(Lots of speckles in the air around the Doctor.)  
COMPUTER: Reboot in three minutes.  
ROSE: What is it?  
DOCTOR: Void stuff.  
ROSE: Like er, background radiation.  
DOCTOR: That's it. Look at the others. And the only one who hasn't been
through the Void, your mother. First time she's looked normal all in her life.  
JACKIE: Oi.  
DOCTOR: But the Daleks lived inside the Void. They're bristling with it.
Cybermen, all of them. I just open the Void and reverse. The Void stuff gets
sucked back inside.  
ROSE: Pulling them all in!  
DOCTOR: Pulling them all in!  
MICKEY: Sorry, what's the Void?  
DOCTOR: The dead space. Some people call it Hell.  
MICKEY: So you're sending the Daleks and Cybermen to Hell. Man, I told you he
was good.  
ROSE: But it's like you said. We've all got Void stuff. Me too, because we
went to that parallel world. We're all contaminated. We'll get pulled in.  
DOCTOR: That's why you've got to go.  
COMPUTER: Reboot in two minutes.  
DOCTOR: Back to Pete's world. Hey, we should call it that. Pete's World. I'm
opening the Void, but only on this side. You'll be safe on that side.  
PETE: And then you close it, for good?  
DOCTOR: The breach itself is soaked in Void stuff. In the end it'll close
itself. And that's it. Kaput.  
ROSE: But you stay on this side?  
MICKEY: But you'll get pulled in.  
DOCTOR: That's why I got these. (Magnaclamps) I'll just have to hold on tight.
I've been doing it all my life.  
ROSE: I'm supposed to go.  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
ROSE: To another world, and then it gets sealed off.  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
ROSE: Forever. That's not going to happen.  
(The building shakes.)  
PETE: We haven't got time to argue. The plan works. We're going. You too. All
of us.  
ROSE: No, I'm not leaving here.  
JACKIE: I'm not going without her.  
PETE: Oh, my God. We're going!  
JACKIE: I've had twenty years without you, so button it. I'm not leaving her.  
ROSE: You've got to.  
JACKIE: Well, that's tough.  
ROSE: Mum.  
COMPUTER: Reboot in one minute.  
ROSE: I've had a life with you for nineteen years, but then I met the Doctor,
and all the things I've seen him do for me, for you, for all of us. For the
whole stupid planet and every planet out there. He does it alone, mum. But not
anymore, because now he's got me.  
(The Doctor puts a medallion around Rose's neck and Pete presses his button.)  
ROSE: What're you

**[Parallel Torchwood]**

ROSE: Oh no, you don't. He's not doing that to me again.  
(Rose hits her button.)

**[Lever room]**

ROSE: I think this is the on switch.

**[Parallel Torchwood]**

(Pete rips off Jackie's medallion.)  
JACKIE: But I've got to go back!  
PETE: The Doctor said every time we use one of these, it damages the whole
world. Now that's it!  
JACKIE: She's your daughter!  
PETE: She's your daughter, not mine. That's an order.  
(Pete takes Mickey's medallion.)  
JACKIE: Mickey, tell him. Tell him, Mickey. Mickey!

**[Lever room]**

DOCTOR: Once the breach collapses, that's it. You will never be able to see
her again. Your own mother!  
ROSE: I made my choice a long time ago, and I'm never going to leave you. So
what can I do to help?  
COMPUTER: Systems rebooted. Open access.  
DOCTOR: Those coordinates over there, set them all at six. And hurry up.  
(Rose goes to the terminal and takes her medallion off.)

**[Parallel Torchwood]**

JACKIE: Get away from me!

**[Lever room]**

ROSE: We've got Cybermen on the way up.  
DOCTOR: How many floors down?  
ROSE: Just one.

**[Stairwell]**

CYBERLEADER: We will retreat through the breach. Regain the Home World.  
(A Cyberman with a gun like Mickey's blocks their way.)  
CYBER-YVONNE: You will not pass.  
CYBERMAN: What is the meaning of this?  
CYBER-YVONNE: You will not pass.  
(She shoots the Cybermen.)  
CYBER-YVONNE: I did my duty for Queen and Country. I did my duty for Queen and
Country. I did my duty for Queen and Country.  
(She cries a tear of blood.)

**[Lever room]**

COMPUTER: Levers operational.  
ROSE: That's more like it. Bit of a smile. The old team.  
DOCTOR: Hope and Glory, Mutt and Jeff, Shiver and Shake.  
ROSE: Which one's Shiver?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm Shake.  
(The Doctor gives Rose a Magnaclamp and they put them on the walls by the
levers.)  
DOCTOR: Press the red button.

**[Midair]**

BLACK DALEK: Breach active. It is the Doctor. Exterminate him!  
(Daleks swoop towards Torchwood Tower.)  
DALEKS: Exterminate!

**[Lever room]**

DOCTOR: When it starts, just hold on tight. Shouldn't be too bad for us but
the Daleks and the Cybermen are steeped in Void stuff. Are you ready?  
ROSE: So are they.  
(The Daleks are visible outside the window.)  
DOCTOR: Let's do it!  
(They push the levers up then grab the Magnaclamps.)  
COMPUTER: Online.  
(A bright light comes out of the breach and a strong wind rushes into it,
sucking the first Daleks through the windows and into itself.)  
DALEKS: Emergency!  
DOCTOR: The breach is open! Into the Void! Ha!  
(Cybermen all over the world are lifted off their feet and into the air. There
is a steady stream of Daleks and Cybermen all being sucked through the one
broken window into the Void.)

**[Midair]**

BLACK DALEK: Emergency temporal shift!  
(The Black Dalek Sek saves himself, but the Ark gets sucked away. On the
ground, people come out of hiding to watch.)

**[Lever room]**

(Rose's lever moves a little.)  
COMPUTER: Offline.  
(The suction starts to decrease. Rose has to let go of the Magnaclamp to grab
the lever and pull it, but she and it are being dragged the wrong way.)  
ROSE: I've got to get it upright!  
(Somehow she manages it.)  
COMPUTER: Online and locked.  
(The suction builds up.)  
DOCTOR: Rose, hold on! Hold on!  
(Rose is being pulled horizontally towards the Void. The Doctor cannot reach
her as her fingers finally slip from the lever handle. Then Pete pops in,
catches her and vanishes with his daughter in his arms. The wind dies down and
the Void closes itself like paper down a plughole.)  
COMPUTER: Systems closed.

**[Parallel Torchwood]**

(Rose hammers on the wall.)  
ROSE: Take me back! Take me back! Take me back.  
PETE: It's stopped working. He did it. He closed the breach.  
ROSE: No.  
(The Doctor and Rose lean against the walls for a few moments, then he walks
away slowly.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Rose.

**[The Tyler house]**

ROSE [OC]: Last night I had a dream.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Rose  
ROSE [OC]: I heard a voice and it was calling my name.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Rose. Rose. Rose.  
ROSE: I had a dream.  
ROSE [OC]: I told Mum and Dad and Mickey. Anyone else would think I was mad.
But not those three. They believed it because they've met the Doctor. So they
listened to the dream.  
ROSE: He was calling me, and  
ROSE [OC]: And that night, we packed up, got into dad's old Jeep and off we
went. Just like the dream said. Followed the voice across the water. Kept on
driving hundreds and hundreds of miles, because he's calling.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Rose.

**[D�rlig Ulv Stranden]**

(Rose walks alone across the windswept beach. Pete, Jackie and Mickey stay
with the Jeep.)  
ROSE [OC]: Here I am at last. And this is the story of how I died.  
(An image of the Doctor appears near Rose.)  
ROSE: Where are you?  
HOLO-DOCTOR: Inside the Tardis.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: There's one tiny little gap in the Universe left, just about to close,
and it takes a lot of power to send this projection. I'm in orbit around a
super nova. I'm burning up a sun just to say goodbye.

**[D�rlig Ulv Stranden]**

ROSE: You look like a ghost.  
HOLO-DOCTOR: Hold on  
(He uses his sonic screwdriver to solidify the image.)  
ROSE: Can I  
HOLO-DOCTOR: I'm still just an image. No touch.  
ROSE: Can't you come through properly?  
HOLO-DOCTOR: The whole thing would fracture. Two universes would collapse.  
ROSE: So?  
HOLO-DOCTOR: Where are we? Where did the gap come out?  
ROSE: We're in Norway.  
HOLO-DOCTOR: Norway. Right.  
ROSE: About fifty miles out of Burgen. It's called 'D�rlig Ulv Stranden'.  
HOLO-DOCTOR: Dalek?  
ROSE: D�rlig. It's Norwegian for bad. This translates as Bad Wolf Bay. How
long have we got?  
HOLO-DOCTOR: About two minutes.  
ROSE: I can't think of what to say!  
HOLO-DOCTOR: You've still got Mister Mickey, then?  
ROSE: There's five of us now. Mum, Dad, Mickey and the baby.  
HOLO-DOCTOR: You're not?  
ROSE: No. It's mum. She's three months gone. More Tylers on the way.  
HOLO-DOCTOR: And what about you? Are you  
ROSE: Yeah, I'm back working in the shop.  
HOLO-DOCTOR: Oh, good for you.  
ROSE: Shut up. No, I'm not. There's still a Torchwood on this planet. It's
open for business. I think I know a thing or two about aliens.  
HOLO-DOCTOR: Rose Tyler, Defender of the Earth. You're dead, officially, back
home. So many people died that day and you've gone missing. You're on a list
of the dead. Here you are, living a life day after day. The one adventure I
can never have.  
ROSE: Am I ever going to see you again?  
HOLO-DOCTOR: You can't.  
ROSE: What're you going to do?  
HOLO-DOCTOR: Oh, I've got the Tardis. Same old life, last of the Time Lords.  
ROSE: On your own. I, I love you.  
HOLO-DOCTOR: Quite right, too. And I suppose, if it's one last chance to say
it, Rose Tyler  
(The Doctor vanishes. He stands in the Tardis, crying, as Jackie runs go
comfort her sobbing daughter.)

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor slowly walks around the console, setting controls, then looks up
and sees a figure in white, complete with veil.)  
DOCTOR: What?  
(She turns around.)  
DONNA: Oh!  
DOCTOR: What?  
DONNA: Who are you?  
DOCTOR: But  
DONNA: Where am I, eh?  
DOCTOR: What?  
DONNA: What the hell is this place?  
DOCTOR: What?
