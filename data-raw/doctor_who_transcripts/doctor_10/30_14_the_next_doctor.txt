**The Next Doctor**  
  
Original Airdate: 25 Dec, 2008  

**[Market place]**

(The Tardis materialises under a nice mediaeval archway, in the falling snow.
The Doctor steps out and smiles, and walks into a busy Victorian market where
sellers are calling out their wares. The policeman on the beat acknowledges
the Doctor.)  
POLICEMAN: Good afternoon.  
SELLER: Hot chestnuts. Chestnuts.  
CHOIR: Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy. Oh, tidings  
(The Doctor does his Ebenezer Scrooge impression.)  
DOCTOR: You there, boy. What day is this?  
BOY: Christmas Eve, sir.  
DOCTOR: What year?  
BOY: You thick or something?  
DOCTOR: Oi. Just answer the question.  
BOY: Year of our Lord 1851, sir.  
DOCTOR: Right. Nice year. Bit dull.  
ROSITA [OC]: Doctor! Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Who, me?  
(He runs towards the call.)

**[Alleyway]**

ROSITA [OC] Doctor!  
(He finds a dark-skinned young woman.)  
DOCTOR: Don't worry, don't worry. Stand back. What have we got here? (The
large double doors in the wall move and something snarls behind it.)  
DOCTOR: Ooo. Okay, I've got it. Whatever's behind that door, I think you
should get out of here.  
ROSITA: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: No, no. I'm standing right here. Hello.  
ROSITA: Don't be stupid. Who are you?  
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.  
ROSITA: Doctor who?  
ROSITA: Just the Doctor.  
ROSITA: Well, there can't be two of you.  
(Another man runs up.)  
ROSITA: Where the hell have you been?  
NEXT DOCTOR: Right then. Don't worry. Stand back. What have we got here then?  
DOCTOR: Hold on, hold on. Who are you?  
NEXT DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. Simply, the Doctor. The one, the only and the
best. Rosita, give me the sonic screwdriver.  
DOCTOR: The what?  
NEXT DOCTOR: Now quickly, get back to the Tardis.  
DOCTOR: Back to the what?  
NEXT DOCTOR: If you could stand back, sir. This is a job for a Time Lord.  
DOCTOR: Job for a what lord?  
(The doors burst open and an animal with Cyberman-style head is visible.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's different.  
NEXT DOCTOR: Oh, that's new.  
(They both point their screwdrivers at it.)  
TOGETHER: Allons-y.  
NEXT DOCTOR: I've been hunting this beast for a good fortnight. Now step back,
sir.  
(The beast leaps and lands way up the opposite wall. It has a furry body and
metal hands and feet.)  
DOCTOR: Some sort of primitive conversion, like they took the brain of a cat
or a dog.  
NEXT DOCTOR: Well, talking's all very well. Rosita?  
ROSITA: I'm ready.  
(Rosita hands over a large coil of rope.)  
NEXT DOCTOR: Now, watch and learn.  
(The rope is a lasso, and this Next Doctor gets it around the beast in one
try.)  
NEXT DOCTOR: Excellent. Now then, let's pull this timorous beastie down to
earth.  
(The beast climbs higher, pulling him up with it.)  
DOCTOR: Or not.  
NEXT DOCTOR: I might be in a little bit of trouble.  
DOCTOR: Nothing changes. I've got you.  
(But the beast is strong enough to pull the pair of them off the ground.)  
ROSITA: You idiots!  
NEXT DOCTOR: Perhaps if you could pull?  
DOCTOR: I am pulling. In this position, I couldn't not pull, could I?  
(The beast leaps through a window into the top floor of the warehouse.)  
NEXT DOCTOR: Then I suggest you let go, sir.  
DOCTOR: I'm not letting you out of my sight, Doctor. Don't you recognise me?  
NEXT DOCTOR: No, should I? Have we met? This is hardly the right time for me
to go through my social calendar. Argh!

**[Warehouse]**

(The beast pulls them in through the window.)  
DOCTOR: Whoa!  
(And across the dusty floor, on their bottoms, to the opposite window.)  
DOCTOR: It's going to jump!  
NEXT DOCTOR: We're goanna fall!  
(The beast leaps through the window. Rosita cuts the rope with a big axe. The
sore men get up and the Next Doctor starts laughing. Then they hug.)

**[Alleyway]**

ROSITA: Well, I'm glad you think it's so funny. You're mad. Both of you. You
could've got killed.  
NEXT DOCTOR: But evidently we did not. Oh, I should introduce Rosita. My
faithful companion. Always telling me off.  
DOCTOR: Well, they do, don't they? Rosita. Good name. Hello, Rosita.  
ROSITA: Huh. Now I'll have to go and dismantle the traps. All that for
nothing. And we've only got twenty minutes till the funeral, don't forget.
Then back to the Tardis, right?  
DOCTOR: Funeral?  
NEXT DOCTOR: Oh, long story. Not my own, not yet. Oh, I'm not as young as I
was.  
DOCTOR: Well, not as young as you were when you were me.  
NEXT DOCTOR: When I was who?  
DOCTOR: You really don't recognise me?  
NEXT DOCTOR: Not at all.  
DOCTOR: But you're the Doctor. The next Doctor. Or the next but one. A future
Doctor anyway. No, no, don't tell me how it happened. Although, I hope I don't
just trip over a brick. That'd be embarrassing. Then again, painless. Worse
ways to go. Depends on the brick.  
NEXT DOCTOR: You're gabbling, sir. Now might I ask, who are you, exactly?  
DOCTOR: No, I'm, er, I'm just. Smith. John Smith. But I've heard all about
you, Doctor. Bit of a legend, if I say so myself.  
NEXT DOCTOR: Modesty forbids me to agree with you, sir. But yes. Yes, I am.  
DOCTOR: A legend with certain memories missing. Am I right?  
NEXT DOCTOR: How do you know that?  
DOCTOR: You've forgotten me.  
NEXT DOCTOR: Great swathes of my life have been stolen away. When I turn my
mind to the past, there's nothing.  
DOCTOR: Going how far back?  
NEXT DOCTOR: Since the Cybermen. Masters of that hellish wall-scuttler and old
enemies of mine, now at work in London town. You won't believe this, Mister
Smith, but they are creatures from another world.  
DOCTOR: Really. Wow.  
NEXT DOCTOR: It's said they fell onto London, out of the sky in a blaze of
light. And they found me. Something was taken. And something was lost. What
was I like, in the past?  
DOCTOR: I don't think I should say. Sorry. Got to be careful with memory loss.
One wrong word  
NEXT DOCTOR: It's strange, though. I talk of Cybermen from the stars and you
don't blink, Mister Smith.  
DOCTOR: Ah, don't blink. Remember that? Whatever you do, don't blink? The
blinking and the statues? Sally and the angels? No?  
NEXT DOCTOR: You're a very odd man.  
DOCTOR: Hmm, I still am. Something's wrong here.  
NEXT DOCTOR: Oh, the funeral! The funeral's at two o'clock. It's been a
pleasure, Mister Smith. Don't breathe a word of it.  
DOCTOR: Oh, but can't I come with you?  
NEXT DOCTOR: It's far dangerous. Rest assured, I shall keep this city safe.
Oh, and, er merry Christmas, Mister Smith.  
DOCTOR: Merry Christmas, Doctor.  
(The Doctor follows at a short distance.)

**[Vault]**

(A Cyberman with brain visible through the front of its helmet is in charge.)  
CYBERLEADER: Report.  
CYBERMAN: Cybershade sixteen has made contact.  
CYBERLEADER: Then observe the enemy. This man is dangerous. This man is our
enemy. This man is the Doctor.  
NEXT DOCTOR [on monitor]: I've been hunting this beast for a good fortnight.
Now step back, sir.  
CYBERLEADER: The attack is scheduled for fourteen hours. Plans for the
Ascension demand a successful intervention. Is everything in position?  
(A Victorian lady answers him.)  
HARTIGAN: That's rather dependent on you. All I can promise is to do my best.  
CYBERLEADER: Define the parameters of best.  
HARTIGAN: As you would say, I will operate at maximum efficiency. And you'll
keep your part of the bargain?  
CYBERLEADER: You will be heralded in the new age, at the Court of the
CyberKing.  
ALL: The CyberKing will rise.  
HARTIGAN: The CyberKing will rise, indeed. How like a man. Now if you'll
excuse me, I have a funeral to attend.

**[Street]**

(It is a well attended cortege, with quite a solemn crowd following the four
black horses pulling the hearse.)  
NEXT DOCTOR: The late Reverend Fairchild, leaving his place of residence for
the last time. God rest his soul. Now, with the house empty, I shall effect an
entrance at the rear while you go back to the Tardis. This is hardly work for
a woman.  
ROSITA: Oh, don't mind me saving your life. That's work for a woman, isn't it?  
NEXT DOCTOR: The Doctor's companion does what The Doctor says. Off you go.  
(The Doctor watches Rosita leave. The Next Doctor works on a back door, which
suddenly opens.)  
DOCTOR: Hello.  
NEXT DOCTOR: How did you get in?  
DOCTOR: Oh, front door. I'm good at doors. Er, do you mind my asking, is that
your sonic screwdriver?  
NEXT DOCTOR: Yes. I'd be lost without it.  
(It's an ordinary screwdriver.)  
DOCTOR: But that's a screwdriver. How's it sonic?  
NEXT DOCTOR: Well, er, it makes a noise. That's sonic, isn't it? Now, since
we're acting like common burglars, I suggest we get out of plain view.

**[Rev Fairchild's house]**

DOCTOR: This investigation of yours, what's it about?  
NEXT DOCTOR: It started with a murder.  
DOCTOR: Oh, good. I mean bad, but whose?  
NEXT DOCTOR: Mr Jackson Lake, a teacher of mathematics from Sussex. He came to
London three weeks ago and died a terrible death.  
DOCTOR: Cybermen?  
NEXT DOCTOR: It's hard to say. His body was never found. But then it started.
More secret murders, then abductions. Children, stolen away in silence.  
DOCTOR: So whose house is this?  
NEXT DOCTOR: The latest murder. The Reverend Aubrey Fairchild, found with
burns to his forehead, like some advanced form of electrocution.  
DOCTOR: But who was he? Was he important?  
NEXT DOCTOR: You ask a lot of questions.  
DOCTOR: I'm your companion.  
NEXT DOCTOR: The Reverend was the pillar of the community, a member of many
parish boards. A keen advocate of children's charities.  
DOCTOR: Children again. But why would the Cybermen want him dead? And what's
his connection to the first death, this Jackson Lake?  
NEXT DOCTOR: It's funny. I seem to be telling you everything, as though you
engendered some sort of trust. You seem familiar, Mister Smith. I know your
face. But how?  
DOCTOR: I wonder. I can't help noticing you're wearing a fob watch.  
NEXT DOCTOR: Is that important?  
DOCTOR: Legend has it that the memories of a Time Lord can be contained within
a watch. Do you mind?  
(The Next Doctor hands him the watch.)  
DOCTOR: It's said that if it's opened  
(He opens it and the works fall out.)  
DOCTOR: Oh. Maybe not.  
NEXT DOCTOR: It was more for decoration.  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Anyway, alien infiltration.  
NEXT DOCTOR: Yes. Just look for anything different. Possibly metal. Anything
that doesn't seem to belong. Perhaps a mechanical device that could fit no
earthly engine.  
(The Doctor surreptitiously scans with his sonic screwdriver.)  
NEXT DOCTOR: It could even seem to be organic, but unlike any organism of the
natural world. Shush! What's that noise?  
DOCTOR: Oh, it's just me, whistling. I wonder what's in here, though.  
(He opens the writing desk.)  
DOCTOR: Ah. Different and metal, you were right.  
(He takes out two cylinders.)  
DOCTOR: They are infostamps. I mean, at a guess. If I were you, I'd say they
worked something like this.  
(He presses one end and images are projected from the other.)  
DOCTOR: See? Compressed information. Tons of it. That is the history of
London, 1066 to the present day. This is like a disc, a Cyberdisc. But why
would the Cybermen need something so simple? They've got to be wireless.
Unless, they're in the wrong century. They haven't got much power. They need
plain old basic infostamps to update themselves. Are you all right?  
NEXT DOCTOR: I'm fine.  
DOCTOR: No, what is it? What's wrong?  
NEXT DOCTOR: I've seen one of these before. I was holding this device the
night I lost my mind. The night I regenerated. The Cybermen, they made me
change. My mind, my face, my whole self. And you were there. Who are you?  
DOCTOR: A friend. I swear.  
NEXT DOCTOR: Then I beg you, John. Help me.  
DOCTOR: Ah. Two words I never refuse. But it's not a conversation for a dead
man's house. It'll make more sense if we go back to the Tardis. Your Tardis.
Hold on. I just need to do a little final check. Won't take a tick. There's
one more thing I cannot figure. If this room's got infostamps, then maybe,
just maybe, it's got something that needs infostamping.  
(He opens a door. There is a Cyberman behind it.)  
DOCTOR: Okay.  
(He closes it again.)  
DOCTOR: I think we should run.  
(The Cyberman smashes the door down.)  
DOCTOR: Run, Doctor! Now, Doctor!  
CYBERMAN: Delete. The Doctor will be deleted.  
CYBERMAN 2: Delete.  
DOCTOR: Stairs! Can't lead them outside!  
(The Doctor grabs something only to discover it is an umbrella. He takes a
sword from the wall instead.)  
CYBERMAN: Delete.  
DOCTOR: I'm a dab hand with a cutlass. You don't want to come near me when
I've got one of these. This is your last warning. No? Olay, this is really
your last warning! Okay, I give up.  
CYBERMAN: Delete.  
DOCTOR: Listen to me properly. Whatever you're doing stuck in 1851, I can
help! I mean it. I'm the only person in the world who can help you! Listen to
me!  
CYBERMAN: Delete.  
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. You need me. Check your memory banks. My name's the
Doctor. Leave this man alone. The Doctor is me!  
(The Doctor gets a foot onto the leading Cyberman's chest and pushes them back
downstairs.)  
CYBERMAN: Delete.  
DOCTOR: The Doctor, remember? I'm the Doctor! You need me alive. You need the
Doctor, and that's me!  
(The Next Doctor is on the landing, studying the second infostamp. The
Cybermen knock the Doctor down.)  
CYBERMAN: Delete.  
(The Next Doctor activates the infostamp and aims the beam at the Cybermen.
They fall to their knees then their heads explode.)  
DOCTOR: Infostamp with a Cyclo-Steinham core. You ripped open the core and
broke the safety. Zap! Only the Doctor would think of that.  
NEXT DOCTOR: I did that last time.  
DOCTOR: Come here. You'll be okay. Let me just check.  
NEXT DOCTOR: You told them you were the Doctor. Why did you do that?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I was just protecting you.  
NEXT DOCTOR: You're trying to take away the only thing I've got, like they
did. They stole something, something so precious, but I can't remember. What
happened to me? What did they do?  
DOCTOR: We'll find out. You and me together.

**[Cemetery]**

(The coffin is lowered into the grave.)  
VICAR: Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take
unto Himself the soul of our dear brother here departed, we therefore commit
his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes and dust to dust, in
sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord
Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it may be like unto his
glorious body, according to the mighty working  
(Miss Hartigan's red dress and umbrella are putting the clergyman off.)  
HARTIGAN: Do continue.  
VICAR: Madam, I must protest.  
HARTIGAN: Whatever for?  
VICAR: A lady at the graveside is debatable enough, but your apparel.  
HARTIGAN: Is it too exciting?  
COLE: You're disgracing the ceremony, dressed like a harlot.  
HARTIGAN: Oh, and you should know, Mister Cole.  
COLE: How do you know my name?  
HARTIGAN: You've walked past me so many times, all you good men of charity,
never once asking my name.  
SCOONES: It's Miss Hartigan, isn't it?  
HARTIGAN: Oh, you noticed. I saw you looking, you cheeky boy.  
VICAR: I'm sorry, but who is she?  
HARTIGAN: Matron of the St Joseph Workhouse, your humble servant. Oh, I've
watched you all. Visiting, smiling, bestowing your beneficence upon the poor
while I scrubbed down their filthy beds.  
VICAR: I must insist that you depart.  
HARTIGAN: But that's why the late Reverend Fairchild had to die. To gather you
all in one place. Where better than a funeral? Man that is born of woman hath
but a short time to live. Although I've got some friends who might disagree
with that. Would you like to meet them? Hark! I can hear them now.  
(Many feet, stamping in unison on the snow, then the Cybermen appear through
the snow shower and surround the men.)  
HARTIGAN: Mister Cole, Mister Scoones, Mister Fetch, Mister Milligan, stay
where you are. You're needed. The rest of you are disposable. Sorry.  
VICAR: What manner of men are they?  
HARTIGAN: Cybermen.  
(Several Cybershades are there, too.)  
MAN: Save yourselves!  
(Chaos and consternation. A Cybershade pounces on a man's back as he flees.
Others get electrocuted by the Cybermen.)  
HARTIGAN: I repeat. Mister Cole, Mister Scoones, Mister Fetch, Mister
Milligan. Stay.  
(Bodies litter the tombstones.)  
COLE: You monstrous witch.  
HARTIGAN: Merry Christmas to you, too.  
SCOONES: But why are we spared? What do you need us for?  
HARTIGAN: Your children. It's funny, now I think of it, but in all these years
not one of you has asked my first name. It's Mercy.

**[Alleyway]**

ROSITA: Doctor! I thought you were dead!  
(Rosita hugs her Doctor.)  
NEXT DOCTOR: Now then, Rosita. A little decorum.  
ROSITA: You've been gone for so long. He's always doing this, leaving me
behind. Going frantic.  
NEXT DOCTOR: What about the Tardis?  
ROSITA: Oh, she's ready. Come on.  
DOCTOR: I'm looking forward to this.

**[Stables]**

(No horses. The stalls have been converted into the Next Doctor's living
space.)  
NEXT DOCTOR; You were right though, Rosita. The Reverend Fairchild's death was
the work of the Cybermen.  
DOCTOR: So, you live here?  
NEXT DOCTOR: A temporary base, until we rout the enemy. The Tardis is
magnificent, but it's hardly a home.  
DOCTOR: And where's the Tardis now?  
NEXT DOCTOR: In the yard.  
DOCTOR: Er, what's all this luggage?  
NEXT DOCTOR: Evidence. The property of Jackson Lake, the first man to be
murdered. Oh, but my new friend is a fighter, Rosita, much like myself. He
faced the Cybermen with a cutlass. I'm not ashamed to say, he was braver than
I. He was quite brilliant.  
(The Doctor scans the luggage.)  
NEXT DOCTOR: Are you whistling again?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I am, yeah. Yeah.  
(The Doctor mouths shush to Rosita as he puts the sonic screwdriver back in
his pocket and takes a suitcase off the pile.)  
ROSITA: That's another man's property.  
DOCTOR: Well, a dead man's.  
(He opens the suitcase.)  
DOCTOR: How did you two meet, then?  
ROSITA: He saved my life. Late one night, by the Osterman's Wharf, this
creature came out of the shadows. A man made of metal. I thought I was going
to die. And then, there he was. The Doctor. Can you help him, sir? He has such
terrible dreams. Wakes at night in such a state of terror.  
NEXT DOCTOR: Come now, Rosita. With all the things a Time Lord has seen,
everything he's lost, he may surely have bad dreams.  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Oh, now. Look. Jackson Lake had an infostamp.  
NEXT DOCTOR: But how? Is that significant?  
DOCTOR: Doctor, the answer to all this is in your Tardis. Can I see it?  
NEXT DOCTOR: Mister Smith, it would be my honour.

**[Yard]**

NEXT DOCTOR: There she is. My transport through time and space. The Tardis.  
(An elaborately patterned, but mostly blue, Montgolfier.)  
DOCTOR: You've got a balloon.  
NEXT DOCTOR: Tardis. T A R D I S. It stands for Tethered Aerial Release
Developed In Style. Do you see?  
DOCTOR: Well, I do now. I like it. Good Tardis. Brilliant. Nice one. And is it
inflated by gas, yeah?  
NEXT DOCTOR: We're adjacent to the Mutton Street Gasworks. I pay them a modest
fee. Good work, Jed.  
(He slaps a strapping young man on the shoulder and hands him a big five pound
note. I know that because it is white.)  
JED: Glad to be of service, sir.  
DOCTOR: You've got quite a bit of money.  
NEXT DOCTOR: Oh, you get nothing for nothing. How's that ripped panel, Jed?  
JED: All repaired. Should work a treat. You never know, maybe tonight's the
night, Doctor. Imagine it, seeing Christmas from above.  
NEXT DOCTOR: Not just yet, I think. One day, I will ascend. One day soon.  
(Jed leaves.)  
DOCTOR: You've never actually been up?  
ROSITA: He dreams of leaving, but never does.  
NEXT DOCTOR: I can depart in the Tardis once London is safe. And finally, when
I'm up there. Think of it, John. The time and the space.  
DOCTOR: The perfect escape. Do you ever wonder what you're escaping from?  
NEXT DOCTOR: With every moment.  
DOCTOR: Then do you want me to tell you? Because I think I've worked it out
now. How you became The Doctor. What do you think? Do you want to know?

**[Street]**

(The four men face Miss Hartigan. They all have blinkies in their ears.)  
HARTIGAN: Mister Cole, Mister Scoones, Mister Fetch and Mister Milligan, you
have your instructions and the Court of the CyberKing is waiting. First of
all, let's just see. A little test. Turn right. Turn left. And face me. Oh, I
could do this forever. But now, set about your appointed tasks, and bring them
to me.  
(The men walk off. Miss Hartigan gets into a hackney cab and a Cybershade
drives her away.)

**[Stables]**

DOCTOR: The story begins with the Cybermen. A long time away, and not so far
from here, the Cybermen were fought, and they were beaten. And they were sent
into a howling wilderness called The Void, locked inside forever more. But
then a greater battle rose up, so great that everything inside the Void
perished. But, as the walls of the world weakened, the last of the Cybermen
must have fallen through the dimensions, back in time, to land here. And they
found you.  
NEXT DOCTOR: I fought them, I know that. But what happened?  
DOCTOR: At the same time, another man came to London. Mister Jackson Lake.
Plenty of luggage, money in his pocket. Maybe coming to town for the winter
season, I don't know. But he found the Cybermen too. And just like you,
exactly like you, he took hold of an infostamp.  
NEXT DOCTOR: But he's dead. Jackson Lake is dead. The Cybermen murdered him.  
DOCTOR: You said no body was ever found. And you kept all his suitcases, but
you could never bring yourself to open them. I told you the answer was in the
fob watch. Can I see?  
(The Next Doctor hands the watch to the Doctor. The case is plain except for
two initials.)  
DOCTOR: J L. The watch is Jackson Lake's.  
ROSITA: Jackson Lake is you, sir?  
LAKE: But I'm the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: You became the Doctor because the infostamp you picked up was a book
about one particular man.  
(The Doctor projects the infostamp onto the wall. We see dear old William
Hartnell, then Patrick and all the others.)  
DOCTOR: The Cybermen's database. Stolen from the Daleks inside the Void, I'd
say, but it's everything you could want to know about the Doctor.  
(The images get to number ten.)  
LAKE: That's you.  
DOCTOR: Time Lord, Tardis, enemy of the Cybermen. The one and the only. You
see, the infostamp must have backfired. Streamed all that information about me
right inside your head.  
LAKE: I am nothing but a lie.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. Infostamps are just facts and figures. All that
bravery. Saving Rosita, defending London town, hmm? And the invention.
Building a Tardis. That's all you.  
LAKE: And what else? Tell me what else.  
DOCTOR: There's still something missing, isn't there?  
LAKE: I demand you tell me, sir. Tell me what they took.  
DOCTOR: Sorry. Really, I am so sorry, but that's an awful lot of luggage for
one man. Because an infostamp is plain technology. It's not enough to make a
man lose his mind. What you suffered is called a fugue. A fugue state, where
the mind just runs away because it can't bear to look back. You wanted to
become someone else, because Jackson Lake had lost so much.  
(A church bell tolls the hours.)  
ROSITA: Midnight. Christmas Day.  
LAKE: I remember. Oh, my God.  
LAKE [memory]: Caroline, get out!  
LAKE: Caroline. They killed my wife. They killed her.  
(The infostamp beeps. The button on the end is lit up. And there are more of
them in a trunk.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, you found a whole cache of infostamps.  
ROSITA: But what is it? What's that noise?  
DOCTOR: Activation. A call to arms. The Cybermen are moving!  
(The Doctor runs outside, and sees marching shadows against a wall.)  
LAKE: The Doctor needs help. I learnt that much about him. There should be
someone at his side. Now go. Go.  
(Rosita leaves.)

**[Street]**

{It is children, not Cybermen, marching past.}  
ROSITA: What is it? What's happening? That's Mister Cole. He's Master of the
Hazel Street Workhouse. Maybe he's taking them to prayers.  
DOCTOR: Oh, nothing as holy as that.  
(The Doctor catches up with Cole.)  
DOCTOR: Can you hear me? Hello? No? Mister Cole, you seem to have something in
your ear. Now, this might hurt a bit, but if I can just  
(A Cybershade growls nearby.)  
DOCTOR: Ah. They're on guard. Can't risk a fight. Not with the children.  
ROSITA: But where are they going?  
JED: They all need a good whipping, if you ask me. There's tons of them. I've
just seen another lot coming down from the Ingleby Workhouse down Broadback
Lane.  
DOCTOR: Where's that?  
ROSITA: This way.

**[Lane]**

(They watch the children being walked past.)  
ROSITA: There's dozens of them.  
DOCTOR: But what for?

**[Outside the sewage works]**

(The children stop outside a large pair of double doors. Suddenly it is opened
by a Cyberman.)  
SCOONES: You will continue. You will enter the Court of the CyberKing. March.
That is an order. March!  
(Cybershades stop the children from scattering.)

**[Stables]**

(Lake starts searching the luggage.)  
LAKE: Where is it? Where is it?

**[Outside a building]**

ROSITA: That's the door to the sluice. All the sewage runs through there,
straight into the Thames.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's too well guarded. We'll have to find another way in.  
(But they are spotted by two more Cybermen on guard.)  
DOCTOR: Whoa! That's cheating, sneaking up. Do you have your legs on silent?  
HARTIGAN: So, what do we have here?  
DOCTOR: Listen. Just walk towards me slowly. Don't let them touch you.  
HARTIGAN: Oh, but they wouldn't hurt me, my fine boys. They are my knights in
shining armour, quite literally.  
DOCTOR: Even if they've converted you, that's not a Cyber speech pattern.
You've still got free will. I'm telling you, step away.  
HARTIGAN: There's been no conversion, sir. No one's ever been able to change
my mind. The Cybermen offered me the one thing I wanted. Liberation.  
ROSITA: Who are you?  
HARTIGAN: You can be quiet. I doubt he paid you to talk. More importantly, who
are you, sir, with such intimate knowledge of my companions.  
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.  
CYBERMAN: Incorrect. You do not correspond to our image of the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, but that's because your database got corrupted. Oh, look, look,
look. Check this. The Doctor's infostamp.  
(He throws it to a Cyberman.)  
DOCTOR: Plug it in. Go on. Download.  
CYBERMAN: The core has been damaged. This infostamp would damage Cyberunits.  
DOCTOR: Oh, well. Nice try.  
CYBERMAN: Core repaired. Download.  
(The Cyberman plugs the infostamp into its chest.)  
CYBERMAN: You are the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Hello.  
CYBERMAN: You will be deleted.  
DOCTOR: No, no. Oh, but let me die happy. Tell me, what do you need those
children for?  
HARTIGAN: What are children ever needed for? They're a workforce.  
DOCTOR: But for what?  
HARTIGAN: Very soon now, the whole Empire will see. And they will bow down in
worship.  
DOCTOR: And it's all been timed for Christmas Day. Was that your idea, Miss ?  
HARTIGAN: Hartigan. Yes. The perfect day for a birth, with a new message for
the people. Only this time, it won't be the words of a man.  
DOCTOR: The birth of what?  
HARTIGAN: A birth, and a death. Namely, yours. Thank you, Doctor. I'm glad to
have been part of your very last conversation. Now, delete them.  
CYBERMAN: Delete.  
(The Cybermen stomp forward, then their heads light up and they collapse.
Jackson Lake is wearing a bandolier of infostamps.)  
LAKE: At your service, Doctor.  
HARTIGAN: Shades! Shades!  
DOCTOR: Run! Come on!  
HARTIGAN: Shades!  
ROSITA: One last thing.  
(Rosita hits Hartigan, and she falls.)  
DOCTOR: Can I say, I completely disapprove. Come on.  
(The Doctor, Rosita and Lake run off. The Cybershades run to their mistress.)  
HARTIGAN: Get off me. I said, get off. Tell your masters we're not waiting
till dawn. The CyberKing will rise tonight!

**[Alley]**

DOCTOR: That stronghold down by the river. I need to find a way in.  
LAKE: I'm ahead of you. My wife and I were moving to London so I could take up
a post at the university. And while my memory is still not intact, this was in
the luggage. The deeds. Fifteen Latimer Street. And if I discovered the
Cybermen there, in the cellar, then  
DOCTOR: That might be our way in. Brilliant.  
LAKE: There's still more. I remember the cellar and my wife, but I swear there
was something else in that room. If we can find that, perhaps that's the key
to defeating these invaders. So, onwards!  
DOCTOR: Maybe you should go back  
ROSITA: Don't even try.

**[Control room]**

CYBERLEADER: You have wisdom. If the Doctor is planning to intervene, then the
Ascension will commence immediately.  
HARTIGAN: Excellent. And as for you, Mister Cole, Mister Scoones, Mister Fetch
and Mister Milligan, your work is done.  
(She moves a lever and their earpieces electrocute the men.)  
HARTIGAN: Children! Pay attention. Now let the new Industrial Revolution
begin. I want to see you work!  
(The children turn capstans and stoke boilers in the engine house.)  
CYBERLEADER: Energy levels sixty percent and rising. Soon the CyberKing will
awake.  
HARTIGAN: Then show me.

**[Cellar]**

(A Cyberman stands guard at the bottom of the cellar steps at 15 Latimer
Street.)  
CYBERMAN: Delete.  
(Lake zaps it with an infostamp. The Doctor runs over to a high tech device in
the middle of the room.)  
DOCTOR: It must've been guarding this. A Dimension Vault. Stolen from the
Daleks again. That's how the Cybermen travelled through time. Jackson, is this
it? The thing you couldn't remember?  
LAKE: I don't think so. I just can't see. It's like it's hidden.  
DOCTOR: Not enough power. Come on! Avanti!

**[Throne room]**

(A drawbridge leads to an electrical chair with two Cybermen standing either
side.)  
HARTIGAN: Oh, that is magnificent. That is royalty, indeed. And that's quite a
throne. Oh, you will look resplendent.  
CYBERLEADER: The chair you designate as throne is not intended for me. My
function is to serve the CyberKing, not to become the CyberKing.  
HARTIGAN: Then who sits there?  
(The CyberLeader looks at her.)  
HARTIGAN: No! Now, just. I think if you remember correctly you said I was to
be heralded.  
CYBERLEADER: All hail the CyberKing.  
ALL: All hail the CyberKing.  
HARTIGAN: But you promised me. You said I would never be converted.  
CYBERLEADER: That was designated a lie.

**[Sewers]**

(Remarkably dry and rat-free.)  
ROSITA: What do the Cybermen want?  
DOCTOR: They want us. That's what Cybermen are. Human beings with their brains
put into metal shells. They want every living thing to be like them.

**[Throne room]**

(Mercy Hartigan has been secured to the throne.)  
HARTIGAN: You can't do this to me!  
CYBERLEADER: Incorrect. It is done.  
HARTIGAN: But I would have served you anyway!  
CYBERLEADER: Your mind is riven with anger and abuse and revenge. These have
no place in a Cybermind. Activate. Emotions have tormented you all of your
life. Now you will be set free. This is your liberation.  
HARTIGAN: Oh, for the love of God, have you no pity?  
CYBERLEADER: Correct.  
(An open faced brass helmet descends, and Miss Hartigan is converted.)  
CYBERLEADER: A CyberKing is born.  
ALL: All hail the CyberKing.  
(Hartigan opens her eyes. They are completely black.)

**[Sewer]**

(The Doctor, Lake and Rosita look down on the child labourers from a sewer
opening high in the wall.)  
LAKE: Upon my soul.  
ROSITA: What is it?  
DOCTOR: It's an engine. They're generating electricity, but what for?  
LAKE: We can set them free.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

**[Throne room]**

HARTIGAN: Behold such information.

**[Control room]**

DOCTOR: Power at ninety percent. But if we stop the engine, the power dies
down, the Cybermen'll come running. Ooo. Hold on. Power fluctuation. That's
not meant to happen.  
LAKE: It's going wrong.  
DOCTOR: No, it's weird. The software's rewriting itself. It's changing.

**[Throne room]**

HARTIGAN: I can see the stars, the worlds beyond, the Vortex of Time itself,
and the whole of infinity. Oh, but this is glorious!  
CYBERLEADER: That is incorrect. Glorious is an emotional response.  
HARTIGAN: Exactly. There is so much joy in this machine.  
CYBERLEADER: Joy is not acceptable.  
HARTIGAN: Don't you see? My mind is stronger than you ever thought. It
dominates, sir. It dominates you.  
CYBERLEADER: Alert. You are operating beyond the standard parameters.  
HARTIGAN: I am new. The might of your technology combined with my own
imagination. Yes! There will be a new race of Cybermen. My Cybermen. Logic and
strength combined with fury and passion.  
CYBERLEADER: Diagnosis, system failure. You will be removed from the
processor.  
(The Cyberleader steps forward. A beam comes from the top of Hartigan's
helmet, and he explodes.)

**[Control room]**

(The control panel goes bang, too.)  
DOCTOR: Whoa! What the hell's happening? It's out of control.  
LAKE: It's accelerating. Ninety six percent, ninety seven.  
ROSITA: When it reaches a hundred, what about the children?  
DOCTOR: They're disposable. Come on!

**[Throne room]**

HARTIGAN: I am CyberKing. My mind inside the Cybermen. And you will obey me!  
ALL: All hail the CyberKing!

**[Control room]**

CYBERMAN: Power levels now at one hundred percent. Delete the workforce.

**[Engine house]**

CYBERMAN 2: Delete.  
(A klaxon sounds. The children look around in alarm.)  
CYBERMAN 3: Delete. Delete.  
(The Doctor runs in as Lake zaps the Cyberman, then Rosita takes over.)  
DOCTOR: Right. Now, all of you, out! Do you hear me? That's an order! Every
single one of you, run!  
LAKE: All of you, come on, as fast as you can. Come on!  
DOCTOR: There's a hot pie for everyone, if you leg it!  
LAKE: Go!  
DOCTOR: Rosita, get them out of sluice gate. Once you're out, keep running.
Far as you can! Come on, come on, come on.  
ROSITA: Turn right at the corner! Fast as you can. And don't stop! Keep
running! Keep running!

**[Throne room]**

HARTIGAN: Come, my soldiers. Come to me.  
(The Cybermen march forward.)

**[Outside the sewage works]**

ROSITA: Come on! Come on! Keep running! Keep running!

**[Engine house]**

(The Doctor chases some more of the urchins out.)  
DOCTOR: Go! Quick, quick. It's some sort of starter motor, but starting what?  
(Lake watches the last boys leaving, and remembers his wife's death and the
Cybermen carrying his son away.)  
FREDERICK [memory] Help! Father! Father! Father  
(Lake sees a little boy stranded on a platform high up on the machine.)  
LAKE: That's my son. My son. Doctor, my son!  
DOCTOR: What?  
LAKE: They took my son. No wonder my mind escaped. Those damned Cybermen, they
took my child! But he's alive, Doctor. Frederick!  
DOCTOR: Come on!  
LAKE: No, he's too scared. Stay there! Don't move! I'm coming.  
(An explosion knocks him down.)

**[Throne room]**

HARTIGAN: CyberKing rising.  
(The drawbridge falls away and the stage containing the throne and the
Cybermen begins to rise.)

**[Engine house]**

LAKE: I can't get up there. Fred!  
DOCTOR: They've finished with the motor. It's going to blow up.  
LAKE: What are we going to do, Doctor? What are we going to do?  
(The Doctor draws the cutlass he got from the Reverend's house.)  
DOCTOR: Come on, Jackson. You know me.  
(The Doctor grabs hold of a rope and cuts it free from its tether. He goes up
into the air and lands on the platform by Frederick.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's it. Hello. Now, hold on tight. Don't let go.  
(Frederick clings on to the Doctor's back as he uses the rope to swing across
the vault, then brings the boy down to his father.)  
DOCTOR: Merry Christmas.

**[Street]**

ROSITA: Go to St Stephen's. Ask for the Warden, he'll take care of you. Now
run! Quickly!  
(Rosita heads back to the sewage works, against the flow of panicking people.)  
MAN: It's under the water! There's something in the Thames!  
(A giant Cyberman is rising up, containing Miss Hartigan and her entourage
where its mouth should be.)

**[Cellar]**

(Lake carries young Frederick back to their house.)  
DOCTOR: Head for the street.  
LAKE: Come on, Doctor. Hurry up!  
(The Doctor takes a long thin piece from the Dimension vault.)  
DOCTOR: Gotcha!

**[CyberKing]**

(The steampunk Cyberman towers over old London town.)  
HARTIGAN: Behold, I am risen. Witness me, mankind, as CyberKing of all.

**[Street]**

DOCTOR: It's a CyberKing.  
LAKE: And a CyberKing is what?  
DOCTOR: It's a ship. Dreadnought class. Front line of an invasion. And inside
the chest, a Cyberfactory, ready to convert millions.

**[CyberKing]**

HARTIGAN: And I will walk. I will stride across this tiny little world.  
(The giant feet crush buildings and people.)  
HARTIGAN: My people. Why do they not rejoice?  
(It strides up St Martin Le Grand and Aldersgate, missing Saint Paul's
Cathedral.)

**[Street]**

DOCTOR: Just head south. Take him south. Go to the parkland.  
LAKE: But where are you going?!  
DOCTOR: To stop that thing.  
LAKE: But I should be with you.  
DOCTOR: Jackson, you've got your son. You've got a reason to live.  
LAKE: And you haven't? God save you, Doctor.  
(They part as the CyberKing keeps walking. With those big strides it should be
in Islington by now.)

**[Stable]**

(The Doctor searches the luggage.)  
JED: What the hell is that thing, sir?  
DOCTOR: Oh, good man. Jed, wasn't it? Jed, I need your help!  
JED: I'm not going out there.  
DOCTOR: I'll give you five pound notes.  
JED: Er. All right. What do you want me to do?  
(The Doctor has another bandolier of infostamps.)  
DOCTOR: The Tardis is going to fly.

**[CyberKing]**

HARTIGAN: People of the world, now hear me. Your governments will surrender.
And if not, then behold my power.  
(The CyberKing turns its arms into megacannons, and shoots indiscriminately.)

**[Yard]**

(The Doctor climbs into the air balloon's basket.)  
JED: You're flaming bonkers, sir.  
DOCTOR: It's been said before. Now give me.  
(Jed hands over the item from the Dimension vault.)  
DOCTOR: Not enough power. Come on! Jed, let her loose.  
JED: Ever flown one of these before?  
DOCTOR: Nope, never.  
JED: Can I have my money now?  
DOCTOR: Oh, get on with it.

**[Street]**

ROSITA: Oh, sir. I thought I'd lost you.  
LAKE: My son, Rosita. This boy is my son.  
(There is an explosion nearby. They duck into a doorway for cover.)

**[Yard]**

(Jed unties the last rope holding the balloon down, and up she floats.)  
JED: Good luck to you, sir!

**[Street]**

LAKE: It's the Tardis. She's flying.  
(The Doctor throws out the sandbags and a picnic hamper.)  
YOUNG MAN: Who the hell is that?  
LAKE: His name, sir, is the Doctor.

**[CyberKing]**

CYBERMAN: Attention. Proximity alert.  
HARTIGAN: How is that even possible? Oh, this I would see. Turn!  
(The Doctor readies his infostamps as the CyberKing swings around so that he
and it are level, facing each other.)  
HARTIGAN: Excellent. The Doctor. Yet another man come to assert himself
against me in the night.  
DOCTOR: Miss Hartigan? I'm offering you a choice. You might have the most
remarkable mind this world has ever seen. Strong enough to control the
Cybermen themselves.  
HARTIGAN: I don't need you to sanction me.  
DOCTOR: No, but such a mind deserves to live. The Cybermen came to this world
using a Dimension vault. I can use that device to find you a home, with no
people to convert, but a new world where you can live out your mechanical life
in peace.  
HARTIGAN: I have the world below, and it is abundant with so many minds ready
to become extensions of me. Why would I leave this place?  
DOCTOR: Because if you don't, I'll have to stop you.  
HARTIGAN: What do you make of me, sir? An idiot?  
DOCTOR: No. The question is, what do you make of me?  
HARTIGAN: Destroy him.  
DOCTOR: You make me into this.  
(The Doctor fires his array of infostamps into Miss Hartigan.)  
HARTIGAN: Then I have made you a failure. Your weapons are useless, sir.  
DOCTOR: I wasn't trying to kill you. All I did was break the Cyber-connection,
leaving your mind open. Open, I think, for the first time in far too many
years. So you can see. Just look at yourself. Look at what you've done.  
(Mercy Hartigan's eyes have returned to normal. The Cybermen are staring at
her.)  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Miss Hartigan, but look at what you've become.  
(She screams and realises she is secured to the throne.)  
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry.  
(She continues to scream. Electricity dances around the Cybermen and they all
explode. She also vanishes. The CyberKing begins to sway.)

**[Street]**

LAKE: He's killed it! Whatever he did, he's killed it.  
(Explosions go off inside the CyberKing.)  
ROSITA: But it's going to fall!  
(Much screaming and running away.)

**[Balloon basket]**

(The Dimension vault thing beeps.)  
DOCTOR: Ooo, now you're ready.  
(He aims it at the CyberKing. Swirls of energy surround it and it vanishes.)

**[Street]**

LAKE: Well, I'd say he used that Dimension vault to transfer the wreckage of
the CyberKing into the Time Vortex, t here to be harmlessly disintegrated. Oh,
I've picked up a lot. Ah, but here. Ladies and gentlemen, I know that man,
that Doctor on high. And I know that he has done this deed a thousand times.
But not once. No, sir, not once, not ever, has he ever been thanked. But no
more. For I say to you, on this Christmas morn, bravo, sir! Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo, sir!  
(Up in the sky, the Doctor hears the cheers and applause, and waves back,
ringing the basket's bell.)  
LAKE: Bravo, Doctor.

**[Market place]**

LAKE: The city will recover, as London always does. Though the events of today
will be history, spoken of for centuries to come.  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Funny that.  
LAKE: And a new history begins for me. I find myself a widower, but with my
son and with a good friend.  
DOCTOR: Now, take care of that one. She's marvellous.  
LAKE: Frederick will need a nursemaid and I can think of none better. But
you're welcome to join us. We thought we might all dine together at the
Traveller's Halt. A Christmas feast in celebration, and in memory of those we
have lost. You won't stay?  
DOCTOR: Like I said, you know me.  
LAKE: No I don't think anyone does.  
(He sees the real Tardis underneath the archway.)  
LAKE: Oh! And this is it. Oh! Oh, if I might, Doctor. One last adventure?  
DOCTOR: Oh, be my guest.

**[Tardis]**

LAKE: Oh. Oh my word. Oh. Oh, goodness me. Well. But this is, but this is
nonsense.  
DOCTOR: Well, that's one word for it.  
LAKE: Complete and utter, wonderful nonsense. How very, very silly. Oh, no. I
can't bear it. Oh, it's causing my head to ache. No. No, no, no, no, no, no

**[Market place]**

LAKE: Oh! Oh, gracious. That's quite enough. I take it this is goodbye.  
DOCTOR: Onwards and upwards.  
LAKE: Tell me one thing. All those facts and figures I saw of the Doctor's
life, you were never alone. All those bright and shining companions. But not
any more?  
DOCTOR: No.  
LAKE: Might I ask why not?  
DOCTOR: They leave. Because they should. Or they find someone else. And some
of them, some of them forget me. I suppose in the end, they break my heart.  
LAKE: That offer of Christmas dinner. It's no longer a request, it's a demand.
In memory of those we've lost.  
DOCTOR: Oh, go on then.  
LAKE: Really?  
DOCTOR: Just this once. You've actually gone and changed my mind. Not many
people can do that. Jackson, if anyone had to be the Doctor, I'm glad it was
you.  
LAKE: The feast awaits. Come with me. Walk this way.  
DOCTOR: I certainly will. Merry Christmas to you, Jackson.  
LAKE: Merry Christmas indeed, Doctor.
