**The Impossible Planet**  
  
Original Airdate: 3 Jun, 2006  

**[Storage area 6]**

(The Tardis materialises in a very tight space.)  
DOCTOR: I don't know what's wrong though. She's sort of queasy. Indigestion,
like she didn't want to land.  
ROSE: Oh, if you think there's going to be trouble, we could always get back
inside and go somewhere else.  
(They both laugh.)  
DOCTOR: I think we've landed inside a cupboard. Here we go.

**[Junction]**

COMPUTER: Open door 15.  
DOCTOR: Some sort of base. Moon base, sea base, space base. They build these
things out of kits.  
COMPUTER: Close door 15.  
ROSE: Glad we're indoors. sounds like a storm out there.  
COMPUTER: Open door 16.

**[Corridor]**

DOCTOR: Human design. You've got a thing about kits. This place was put
together like a flat pack wardrobe, only bigger. And easier.

**[Habitation 3]**

(Three steps down into an area with tables and chairs. There is a big 3 on the
wall.)  
COMPUTER: Open door 17.  
DOCTOR: Oh, it's a sanctuary base.  
COMPUTER: Close door 17.  
DOCTOR: Deep Space exploration. We've gone way out. And listen to that,
underneath. Someone's drilling.  
ROSE: Welcome to hell.  
DOCTOR: Oh, it's not that bad.  
ROSE: No, over there.  
(The words are painted on the wall in big block letters, and a vertical alien
script underneath.)  
DOCTOR: Hold on, what does that say? That's weird, it won't translate.  
ROSE: But I thought the Tardis translated everything, writing as well. We
should see English.  
DOCTOR: Exactly. If that's not working, then it means this writing is old.
Very old. Impossibly old. We should find out who's in charge.  
(He starts to spin the wheel on another bulkhead door.)  
DOCTOR: We've gone beyond the reach of the Tardis' knowledge. Not a good move.
And if someone's lucky enough  
COMPUTER: Open door 19.  
(Aliens with tentacles where our noses and mouths are, are standing outside
the door. They all have a tube going in behind the tentacles, and carry a
white globe in their right hands which they use for communication, just like
the Gaim in Babylon 5.)  
DOCTOR: Oh! Right. Hello. Sorry. I was just saying, er, nice base.  
ALL OOD: We must feed.  
DOCTOR: You've got to what?  
ALL OOD: We must feed.  
ROSE: Yeah. I think they mean us.  
(The Ood enter and Rose and the Doctor back away.)  
ALL OOD: We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed.  
(More Ood enter from other doors. The Doctor gets out his sonic screwdriver
while Rose picks up a chair.)  
ALL OOD: We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed.
We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed.  
OOD: We must feed.  
(It taps the globe.)  
OOD: You, if you are hungry.  
DOCTOR: Sorry?  
OOD: We apologise. Electromagnetics have interfered with speech systems. Would
you like some refreshment?  
DOCTOR: Er  
COMPUTER: Open door 18.  
(Humans enter.)  
JEFFERSON: What the hell? How did?  
(The Ood make way for the newcomers. The lead man uses a wrist-comm.)  
JEFFERSON: Captain, you're not going to believe this. We've got people. Out of
nowhere. I mean, real people. I mean two living people, just standing here
right in front of me.  
ZACH [OC]: Don't be stupid, that's impossible.  
JEFFERSON: I suggest telling them that.  
ROSE: But you're a sort of space base. You must have visitors now and then. It
can't be that impossible.  
JEFFERSON: You're telling me you don't know where you are?  
DOCTOR: No idea. More fun that way.  
(A woman's voice makes a broadcast.)  
SCOOTI [on tannoy]: Stand by, everyone. Buckle down. We have incoming. And
it's a big one. Quake point five on its way.  
(Jefferson opens a door.)  
JEFFERSON: Through here, now. Quickly, come on! Move!

**[Corridor]**

(Conduits go bang overhead.)  
JEFFERSON: Move it! Come on! Keep moving. Come on! Quickly! Move it!

**[Control room]**

(Steps down into another room full of people working at control panels.)  
ZACH: Oh, my God. You meant it.  
SCOOTI: People! Look at that, real people!  
DOCTOR: That's us. Hooray!  
ROSE: Yeah, definitely real. My name's Rose. Rose Tyler. And, and this is the
Doctor.  
DANNY: Come on the oxygen must be offline. We're hallucinating. They can't be.
No, they're real.  
ZACH: Come on, we're in the middle of an alert! Danny, strap up. The quake's
coming in! Impact in thirty seconds! Sorry you two, whoever you are. Just hold
on, tight.  
ROSE: Hold on to what?  
ZACH: Anything. I don't care. Just hold on. Ood, are we fixed?  
OOD: Your kindness in this emergency is much appreciated.  
DOCTOR: What's this planet called, anyway?  
IDA: Now, don't be stupid. It hasn't got a name. How could it have a name? You
really don't know, do you?  
ZACH: And impact!  
(The whole place shakes for a few seconds.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, well, that wasn't so bad.  
(And again, much worse. Consoles burst into flames.)  
ZACH: Okay, that's it. Everyone all right? Speak to me, Ida.  
IDA: Yeah, yeah!  
ZACH: Danny?  
DANNY: Fine.  
ZACH: Toby?  
TOBY: Yeah, fine.  
ZACH: Scooti?  
SCOOTI: No damage.  
ZACH: Jefferson?  
JEFFERSON: Check!  
DOCTOR: We're fine, thanks, fine. Yeah, don't worry about us.  
ZACH: The surface caved in.  
(He looks up at a schematic of the base.)  
ZACH: I deflected it onto storage five through eight. We've lost them
completely. Toby, go and check the rocket link.  
TOBY: That's not my department.  
ZACH: Just do as I say, yeah?  
(Toby leaves.)  
IDA: Oxygen holding. Internal gravity fifty six point six. We should be okay.  
ROSE: Never mind the earthquake, that's, that's one hell of a storm. What is
that, a hurricane?  
SCOOTI: You'd need an atmosphere for a hurricane. There's no air out there.
It's a complete vacuum.  
ROSE: Then what's shaking the roof?  
IDA: You're not joking. You really don't know. Well introductions. F Y I, as
they said in the olden days. I'm Ida Scott, science officer. Zachary Cross
Flane, acting Captain, sir. You've met Mister Jefferson, he's Head of
Security. Danny Bartock, Ethics committee.  
DANNY: Not as boring as it sounds.  
IDA: And that man who just left, that was Toby Zed, Archaeology, and this is
Scooti Manista, Trainee maintenance. And this? This is home.  
(Ida pulls down a lever.)  
ZACH: Brace yourselves. The sight of it sends some people mad.  
(The shutters overhead pull back to reveal a white hot, angry, disc with a
black centre and black dots falling into it.)  
ROSE: That's a black hole.  
DOCTOR: But that's impossible.  
ZACH: I did warn you.  
DOCTOR: We're standing under a black hole.  
IDA: In orbit.  
DOCTOR: But we can't be  
IDA: You can see for yourself. We're in orbit.  
DOCTOR: But we can't be.  
IDA: This lump of rock is suspended in perpetual geostationary orbit around
that black hole without falling in. Discuss.  
ROSE: And that's bad, yeah?  
DOCTOR: Bad doesn't cover it. A black hole's a dead star. It collapses in on
itself, in and in and in until the matter's so dense and tight it starts to
pull everything else in too. Nothing in the universe can escape it. Light,
gravity, time. Everything just gets pulled inside and crushed.  
ROSE: So, they can't be in orbit. We should be pulled right in.  
DOCTOR: We should be dead.  
IDA: And yet here we are, beyond the laws of physics. Welcome on board.  
ROSE: But if there's no atmosphere out there, what's that?  
IDA: Stars breaking up. Gas clouds. We have whole solar systems being ripped
apart above our heads, before falling into that thing.  
ROSE: So, a bit worse than a storm, then.  
IDA: Just a bit.  
ROSE: Just a bit, yeah.  
(Another shake.)

**[Corridor]**

(Toby enters a corridor with door 28 at the end, with scrolls tucked under his
arm.)  
VOICE [OC]: Toby.  
(The lights flicker.)  
TOBY: Who's that? Danny?

**[Control room]**

COMPUTER: Close door 1.  
TOBY: The rocket link's fine.  
(Zach calls up a hologram over the central console.)  
ZACH: That's the black hole, officially designated K three seven Gen five.  
IDA: In the scriptures of the Falltino, this planet is called Kroptor, the
bitter pill. And the black hole is supposed to be a mighty demon. It was
tricked into devouring the planet, only to spit it out, because it was poison.  
ROSE: The bitter pill. I like that.  
DOCTOR: We are so far out. Lost in the drifts of the universe. How did you
even get here?!  
ZACH: We flew in. You see, this planet's generating a gravity field. We don't
know how. We've no idea. But it's kept in constant balance against the black
hole. And the field extends out there as a funnel. A distinct gravity funnel,
reaching out into clear space. That was our way in.  
ROSE: You flew down that thing? Like a rollercoaster.  
ZACH: By rights, the ship should have been torn apart. We lost the Captain,
which is what put me in charge.  
IDA: You're doing a good job.  
ZACH: Yeah, well, needs must.  
DANNY: But if that gravity funnel closes, there's no way out.  
SCOOTI: We had fun speculating about that.  
DANNY: Oh, yeah. That's the word. Fun.  
DOCTOR: But that field would take phenomenal amounts of power. I mean not just
big, but off the scale! Can I?  
IDA: Sure. Help yourself.  
(An Ood gives Rose a plastic cup of drink.)  
OOD: Your refreshment.  
ROSE: Oh, yeah. Thanks. Thank you. I'm sorry, what was your name?  
OOD: We have no titles. We are as one.  
ROSE: Er, what are they called?  
DANNY: Oh, come on. Where have you been living? Everyone's got one.  
ROSE: Well, not me, so, what are they?  
DANNY: They're the Ood.  
ROSE: The Ood?  
DANNY: The Ood.  
ROSE: Well that's ood.  
DANNY: Very ood, but handy. They work the mine shafts. All the drilling and
stuff. Supervision and maintenance. They're born for it. Basic slave race.  
ROSE: You've got slaves?  
SCOOTI: Don't start. She's like one of that lot. Friends of the Ood.  
ROSE: Well maybe I am, yeah. Since when do humans need slaves?  
DANNY: But the Ood offer themselves. If you don't give them orders, they just
pine away and die.  
ROSE: Seriously, you like being ordered about?  
OOD: It is all we crave.  
ROSE: Why's that, then?  
OOD: We have nothing else in life.  
ROSE: Yeah, well, I used to think like that, a long time ago.  
DOCTOR: There we go. Do you see? To generate that gravity field, and the
funnel, you'd need a power source with an inverted self extrapolating reflex
of six to the power of six every six seconds.  
ROSE: That's a lot of sixes.  
DOCTOR: And it's impossible.  
ZACH: It took us two years to work that out  
DOCTOR: I'm very good.  
IDA: But that's why we're here. This power source is ten miles below through
solid rock. Point Zero. We're drilling down to try and find it.  
ZACH: It's giving off readings of over ninety stats on the Blazon scale.  
IDA: It could revolutionise modern science.  
JEFFERSON: We could use it to fuel the Empire.  
DOCTOR: Or start a war.  
TOBY: It's buried beneath us, in the darkness, waiting.  
ROSE: What's your job, chief dramatist?  
TOBY: Well, whatever it is down there is not a natural phenomena. And this,
er, planet once supported life eons ago, before the human race had even
learned to walk.  
DOCTOR: I saw that lettering written on the wall. Did you do that?  
TOBY: I copied it from fragments we found unearthed by the drilling, but I
can't translate it.  
DOCTOR: No, neither can I. And that's saying something.  
TOBY: There was some form of civilisation. They buried something. Now it's
reaching out, calling us in.  
DOCTOR: And you came.  
IDA: Well, how could we not?  
DOCTOR: So, when it comes right down to it, why did you come here? Why did you
do that? Why? I'll tell you why. Because it was there. Brilliant. Excuse me,
er, Zach, wasn't it?  
ZACH: That's me.  
DOCTOR: Just stand there, because I'm going to hug you. Is that all right?  
ZACH: I suppose so.  
DOCTOR: Here we go. Come on, then.  
(The Doctor hugs Zach.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, human beings. You are amazing! Ha! Thank you.  
ZACH: Not at all.  
DOCTOR: But apart from that, you're completely mad. You should pack your bags,
get back in that ship and fly for your lives.  
IDA: You can talk. And how the hell did you get here?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I've got this er, this ship. It's hard to explain. It just sort of
appears.  
ROSE: We can show you, we parked down the corridor from er. Oh, what's it
called? Habitation area  
DOCTOR: Three.  
ROSE: Three. Three.  
ZACH: Do you mean storage six?  
DOCTOR: It was a bit of a cupboard, yeah. Storage six. But you said. You said.
You said storage five to eight.  
(The Doctor runs out.)

**[Corridor]**

ROSE: What is it? What's wrong?

**[Habitation 3]**

COMPUTER: Open door 19. Close door 19.  
DOCTOR: Open the door! Come on!  
COMPUTER: Open door 17.

**[Corridor]**

COMPUTER: Open door 15. Door 16 out of commission.  
DOCTOR: It can't be. It can't be!  
ROSE: What's wrong? What is it? Doctor, the Tardis is in there. What's
happened?  
DOCTOR: The Tardis is gone.  
COMPUTER: Door 16 out of commission.  
DOCTOR: The earthquake. This section collapsed.  
ROSE: But it's got to be out there somewhere.  
(Rose looks through the porthole in the bulkhead door.)  
DOCTOR: Look down.

**[Control room]**

DOCTOR: The ground gave way. My Tardis must've fallen down right into the
heart of the planet. But you've got robot drills heading the same way.  
ZACH: We can't divert the drilling.  
DOCTOR: But I need my ship. It's all I've got. Literally the only thing.  
ZACH: Doctor, we've only got the resources to drill one central shaft down to
the power source, and that's it. No diversions, no distractions, no
exceptions. Your machine is lost. All I can do is offer you a lift if we ever
get to leave this place, and that is the end of it.  
IDA: I'll er, put you on the duty roster. We need someone in the laundry.  
(The Doctor and Rose are left alone, except for an Ood.)  
COMPUTER: Open door 1. Close door 1.  
DOCTOR: I've trapped you here.  
ROSE: No, don't worry about me.  
(Shaking.)  
ROSE: Okay, we're on a planet that shouldn't exist, under a black hole and no
way out. Yeah, I've changed my mind. Start worrying about me.

**[Outside the base]**

COMPUTER: Entering night shift. Your chosen track for transition is Ravel's
Bolero.  
(Jefferson wanders among the Ood as they work. Scooti is at work on the
planet's surface.)  
SCOOTI: All finished. Coming back inside.

**[Corridor]**

(Danny checks off the Ood as they walk past him.)  
DANNY: Ood 7 Gamma 10. Ood 7 Gamma 11. Ood 7 Gamma 12.

**[Toby's quarters]**

(Toby is examining a fragment of a scrolls beneath a magnifying glass. The
music stops unexpectedly.)  
VOICE [OC]: Toby. I can see you  
TOBY: Danny, is that you? It's, it's not funny, all right? Dan?

**[Corridor]**

(Toby steps out of his quarters into the corridor which ends with doors 38 and
40. It is empty.)  
TOBY: I'm. I'm trying to work, Daniel. Look, if, if that's you, then can you
just stop it ?  
(The lights flicker. Toby takes another look around then goes back inside.)

**[Habitation 3]**

(The Doctor is examining the alien script.)  
ZACH [OC]: Danny, check the temperature in Ood Habitation. It seems to be
rising.  
(Rose goes to get something to eat.)  
SCOOTI: Help yourself. Just don't have the green. Or the blue.  
(Rose takes her tray to the serving window.)  
ROSE: Er, bit of that, thanks.  
(It's the blue.)  
OOD: Would you like sauce with that?  
ROSE: I'll have a go, yeah. I did that job once. I was a, a dinner lady. Not
that I'm calling you a lady. Although, I don't know, you might be. Do you
actually get paid, though? Do they give you money?  
OOD: The Beast and his Armies shall rise from the Pit to make war against God.  
ROSE: I'm sorry?  
OOD: Apologies. I said, I hope you enjoy your meal.  
ROSE: Yeah.

**[Control room]**

COMPUTER: Drill head now at point sixteen. Drill head speed increasing.  
ZACH: Keep pressure at sixty.  
(He turns away from the console, and the hologram in the middle briefly turns
into an image of a roaring horned beast. When he looks back, it disappears.)

**[Corridor]**

COMPUTER: Close door 3.  
DANNY: I've closed door 3.  
COMPUTER: He is awake.  
DANNY: What did you say?  
COMPUTER: Close door 3.

**[Toby's quarters]**

VOICE [OC]: Toby. Don't turn around.  
TOBY: Dan? That's not Dan.  
VOICE [OC]: Don't look at me.  
TOBY: Who are you?  
VOICE [OC]: I have so many names.  
TOBY: If if I could  
VOICE [OC]: If you look at me, you will die.  
TOBY: But who are you?  
VOICE [OC]: I'm behind you, Toby. I'm right behind you. Don't look. Don't look
at me. One look and you will die. I'm reaching out, Toby. I'm so close. Don't
turn around. Oh, I can touch you.  
(Toby turns. There is no one there. He puts down the pieces of pot he was
looking at and rips of his latex gloves. The alien symbols are on the palms of
his hands. He picks up a mirror and they are on his face, too. He falls to the
floor.)

**[Habitation 3]**

(The lights flicker.) IDA: Zach? Have we got a problem?  
ZACH [OC]: No more than usual. Got the Scarlet System burning up. Might be
worth a look.  
IDA: You might want to see this. Moment in history.  
(She opens the shutters.)  
IDA: There. On the edge. That red cloud. That used to be the Scarlet System.
Home to the Peluchi, a mighty civilisation spanning a billion years,
disappearing forever. Their planets and suns consumed. Ladies and gentlemen,
we have witnessed its passing.  
DOCTOR: Er, no, could you leave it open? Just for a bit. I won't go mad, I
promise.  
IDA: How would you know? Scooti, check the lockdown. Jefferson, sign off the
airlock seals for me.  
(Jefferson and Scooti leave by door 17 or 19. Ida uses door 18.)  
COMPUTER: Open door 18.  
ROSE: I've seen films and things, yeah. They say black holes are like gateways
to another universe.  
COMPUTER: Close door 18.  
DOCTOR: Not that one. It just eats.  
ROSE: Long way from home.  
DOCTOR: Go that way, turn right, keep going for er, about, er, five hundred
years, and you'll reach the Earth.  
(Rose turns her phone on.)  
ROSE: No signal. That's the first time we've gone out of range. Mind you, even
if I could. What would I tell her? Can you build another Tardis?  
DOCTOR: They were grown, not built. And with my own planet gone, we're kind of
stuck.  
ROSE: Well, it could be worse. This lot said they'd give us a lift.  
DOCTOR: And then what?  
ROSE: I don't know. Find a planet, get a job, live a life, same as the rest of
the universe.  
DOCTOR: I'd have to settle down. Get a house or something. A proper house
with, with doors and things. Carpets. Me, living in a house. Now that, that is
terrifying.  
ROSE: You'd have to get a mortgage.  
DOCTOR: No.  
ROSE: Oh, yes.  
DOCTOR: I'm dying. That's it. I'm dying. It is all over.  
ROSE: What about me? I'd have to get one, too. I don't know, could be the same
one. We could both, I don't know, share. Or not, you know. Whatever. I don't
know. We'll sort something out  
DOCTOR: Anyway.  
ROSE: We'll see.  
DOCTOR: I promised Jackie I'd always take you back home.  
ROSE: Everyone leaves home in the end.  
DOCTOR: Not to end up stuck here.  
ROSE: Yeah, but stuck with you, that's not so bad.  
DOCTOR: Yeah?  
ROSE: Yes.  
(Rose's phone rings.)  
VOICE [OC]: He is awake.  
(Toby's eyes are red.)

**[Ood habitation]**

DOCTOR: Evening.  
ROSE: Only us.  
DANNY: The mysterious couple. How are you, then? Settling in?  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Sorry, straight to business, the Ood how do they communicate? I
mean, with each other.  
DANNY: Oh, just empaths. There's a low level telepathic field connecting them.
Not that that does them much good. They're basically a herd race. Like cattle.  
(The Ood are sitting on benches down below Danny's catwalk.)  
DOCTOR: This telepathic field. Can it pick up messages?  
ROSE: Because I was having dinner, and one of the Ood said something, well,
odd.  
DANNY: Hmm. An odd Ood.  
ROSE: And then I got something else on my er, communicator thing.  
DANNY: Oh, be fair. We've got whole star systems burning up around us. There's
all sorts of stray transmissions. Probably nothing. Look, if there was
something wrong, it would show. We monitor the telepathic field. It's the only
way to look after them. They're so stupid, they don't even tell us when
they're ill.  
DOCTOR: Monitor the field. That's this thing?  
(Reading basic 5)  
DANNY: Yeah. But like I said, it's low level telepathy. They only register
basic five.  
(Basic 7, 8, 9)  
DOCTOR: Well, that's not basic five. Ten, twenty. They've gone up to basic
thirty.  
(The Ood lift their heads.)  
DANNY: But they can't.  
ROSE: Doctor, the Ood. What does basic thirty mean?  
DANNY: Well, it means that they're shouting, screaming inside their heads.  
DOCTOR: Or something's shouting at them.  
DANNY: But where is it coming from? What is it saying? What did it say to you?  
ROSE: Something about the beast in the pit.  
DANNY: What about your communicator? What did that say?  
ROSE: He is awake.  
ALL OOD: And you will worship him.  
DANNY: What the hell?  
DOCTOR: He is awake.  
ALL OOD: And you will worship him.  
DOCTOR: Worship who? (no reply) Who's talking to you? Who is it?

**[Toby's quarters]**

SCOOTI: Toby, I've got your expenditure  
(The room is empty.)  
COMPUTER: Open door 41. Close door 41.  
SCOOTI: Forty one?

**[Corridor]**

(Forty one is at right angles to forty two.)  
COMPUTER: Close Door 40.  
SCOOTI: Computer, did you open and close door 41?  
COMPUTER: Confirmed.  
SCOOTI: But that's the airlock. Why would you open the airlock? It's the night
shift. We're not allowed outside. Has someone gone out?  
COMPUTER: Confirmed.  
SCOOTI: But who was it?  
COMPUTER: Cannot confirm.  
SCOOTI: Okay. But hold on. I know. Tell me whose spacesuit's been logged out.  
COMPUTER: No spacesuit has been logged out.  
SCOOTI: But you're not making any sense. You can't go outside without. Zach, I
think we've got breakdown on door 41. It's saying somebody's gone outside onto
the planet's surface. Zach? Zach! Computer, trace fault.  
COMPUTER: There is no fault.  
SCOOTI: Tell me who went through that door.  
COMPUTER: He is awake.  
SCOOTI: What?  
COMPUTER: He is awake.  
SCOOTI: What's that supposed to mean?  
COMPUTER: He bathes in the black sun.  
(Scooti looks out of a window by door 41. Toby is standing with his back to
her, then turns, very much alive and smiling, and covered in symbols.)  
SCOOTI: Toby. But there's no air, there's no  
(Toby beckons to her.)  
SCOOTI: No! Stop it! You can't be!  
(Toby clenches his fist, and the glass in the window begins to crack.)  
SCOOTI: Open door 40! Open door 40! Open door 40! Open door 40! Open door 40!  
(The glass breaks. Scooti screams.)  

**[Ood Habitation]**

(The base shakes.)  
COMPUTER: Emergency hull breach. Emergency hull breach.  
DANNY: Which section?

**[Control room]**

ZACH: Everyone, evacuate eleven to thirteen. We've got a breach. The base is
open. Repeat, the base is open!

**[Habitation 3]**

COMPUTER: Open door 19.  
(The Doctor, Rose and Danny run in.)  
COMPUTER: Close door 19.

**[Control room]**

ZACH: I can't contain the oxygen field. We're going to lose it.

**[Corridor]**

JEFFERSON: Come on! Keep moving!  
(The crew are converging from different directions.)  
JEFFERSON: And you too, Toby!  
COMPUTER: Breach sealed. Breach sealed.  
DOCTOR: Everyone all right?! What happened? What was it?  
COMPUTER: Oxygen levels normal.  
JEFFERSON: Hull breach. We were open to the elements. Another couple of
minutes and we'd have been inspecting that black hole at close quarters.  
DOCTOR: That wasn't a quake. What caused it?

**[Control room]**

ZACH: We've lost sections eleven to thirteen Everyone all right?

**[Corridor]**

JEFFERSON: We've got everyone here except Scooti. Scooti, report. Scooti
Manista? That's an order. Report.  
ZACH [OC]: She's all right. I've picked up her biochip. She's in

**[Control room]**

ZACH: Habitation three. Better go and check if she's not responding. She might
be unconscious.  

**[Corridor]**

ZACH: How about that, eh? We survived.  
(Toby's skin is normal again.)  
JEFFERSON: Habitation three. Come on. I don't often say this, but I think we
could all do with a drink. Come on.  
DOCTOR: What happened?  
TOBY: I don't. I don't know. I was working and then I can't remember. All that
noise. The room was falling apart. There was no air  
ROSE: Come on. Up you get. Come and have some protein one.  
DOCTOR: Oh, you've gone native.  
ROSE: Oi, don't knock it. It's nice. Protein one with just a dash of three.

**[Habitation 3]**

IDA: I've checked Habitation four. Can you hear me?  
JEFFERSON: There's no sign of her. The biochip says she's in the area. Have
any of you seen Scooti?  
TOBY: No, no, no, I don't think so.  
IDA: Scooti, please respond. If you can hear this, please respond. Habitation
six.  
JEFFERSON: Nowhere here. Zach? We've got a problem. Scooti's still missing.  
ZACH [OC]: It says Habitation three.  
JEFFERSON: Yeah, well, that's where I am, and I'm telling you she's not here.  
DOCTOR: I've found her.  
(They look up through the open shutters.)  
ROSE: Oh, my God.  
(Scooti is drifting away, towards the black hole.)  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.  
JEFFERSON: Captain. Report Officer Scootori Manista PKD, deceased. Forty three
K two point one.  
IDA: She was twenty. Twenty years old.  
(Ida closes the shutters. Jefferson quotes Horatius, by Thomas Babington
Macaulay.)  
JEFFERSON: For how should man die better than facing fearful odds? For the
ashes of his father and the temples of his Gods.  
IDA: It's stopped.  
(The base falls silent.)  
ROSE: What was that? What was it?  
DOCTOR: The drill.  
IDA: We've stopped drilling. We've made it. Point Zero.

**[Drilling area]**

ZACH [over tannoy]: All non essential Oods to be confined.  
IDA: Capsule established. All systems functioning. The mineshaft is go. Bring
systems online now.  
(Ida and the Doctor are in spacesuits.)  
DOCTOR: Reporting as a volunteer for the expeditionary force.  
ZACH: Doctor, this is breaking every single protocol. We don't even know who
you are.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, but you trust me, don't you? And you can't let Ida go down there
on her own. Go on. Look me in the eye. Yes you do, I can see it. Trust.  
ZACH: I should be going down.  
DOCTOR: The Captain doesn't lead the mission. He stays here, in charge.  
ZACH: Not much good at it, am I? Positions! We're going down in two. Everyone,
positions! Mister Jefferson! I want maximum system enhancement.  
DOCTOR: Oxygen, nitro balance, gravity. It's ages since I wore one of these.  
ROSE: I want that spacesuit back in one piece, you got that?  
DOCTOR: Yes, sir.  
(The Doctor puts on his helmet.)  
ROSE: It's funny, because people back home think that space travel's going to
be all whizzing about and teleports and anti gravity, but it's not, is it?
It's tough.  
DOCTOR: I'll see you later.  
ROSE: Not if I see you first.

**[Ood Habitation]**

DANNY: You will remain here. No command can override this. Have you got that?
My instructions only.  
(The Ood are sitting, quietly.)

**[Control room]**

ZACH: Capsule active. Counting down in ten, nine

**[Drilling area]**

ZACH [OC]: Eight, seven, six  
(The Doctor and Ida go into the capsule. Jefferson closes the door.)  
ZACH [OC]: Five, four, three, two, one. Release.  
(The capsule is lowered on its cable. Toby keeps checking his palms. Rose
checks their progress on the screen whilst clutching the microphone.)

**[Control room]**

ZACH: You've gone beyond the oxygen field. You're on your own.  
(Ida and the Doctor turn on their life support.)

**[Drilling area]**

ROSE: Don't forget to breath. Breathing's good.

**[Control room]**

ZACH: Rose, stay off the comm.

**[Drilling area]**

ROSE: No chance.  
(The capsule shudders even more than usual then suddenly drops. The Ood all
stand up and turn to look up at Danny and a guard. Crunch!)  
ROSE: Doctor? Doctor, are you all right?

**[Control room]**

(The screen says the capsule has reached Point Zero.)  
ZACH: Ida, report to me. Doctor?

**[Point Zero]**

DOCTOR: It's all right. We've made it. Getting out of the capsule now.  
ROSE [OC]: What's it like down there?  
DOCTOR: It's hard to tell. Some sort of cave. Cavern. It's massive.  
IDA: Well, this should help. Gravity globe.  
(She throws up a ball that illuminates the cavern.)  
IDA: That's, that's. My God, that's beautiful.  
DOCTOR: Rose, you can tell Toby we've found his civilisation  
(The walls of the cavern are carved into pillars and statues.)

**[Drilling area]**

ROSE: Oi, Toby. Sounds like you've got plenty of work.  
TOBY: Good, good. Good.

**[Control room]**

ZACH: Concentrate now, people. Keep on the mission. Ida, what about the power
source?

**[Point Zero]**

IDA: We're close. Energy signature indicates north north west. Are you getting
pictures up there?  
ZACH [OC]: There's too much interference. We're in your hands.  
IDA: Well, we've come this far. There's no turning back.  
DOCTOR: Oh, did you have to? No turning back? That's almost as bad as nothing
can possible go wrong, or this is going to be the best Christmas Walford's
ever had.  
IDA: Are you finished?  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Finished.

**[Ood Habitation]**

DANNY: Captain, sir. There's something happening with the Ood.

**[Control room]**

ZACH: What are they doing?

**[Ood Habitation]**

DANNY: They're staring at me. I've told them to stop, but they won't.  
ZACH [OC]: Danny, you're a big boy.

**[Control room]**

ZACH: I think you can take being stared at.

**[Ood Habitation]**

DANNY: But the telepathic field, sir. It's at basic one hundred. I've checked.
there isn't any fault. It's definitely one hundred.

**[Drilling area]**

ZACH [OC]: But that's impossible.  
ROSE: What's basic one hundred mean?

**[Ood Habitation]**

DANNY: They should be dead.

**[Drilling area]**

JEFFERSON: Basic one hundred's brain death.

**[Control room]**

ZACH: But they're safe. They're not actually moving?

**[Ood Habitation]**

DANNY: No, sir.

**[Control room]**

ZACH: Keep watching them. And you, Jefferson?

**[Drilling area]**

ZACH [OC]: Keep a guard on the Ood.  
JEFFERSON: Officer at arms!  
CREWMAN: Yes, sir.  
ROSE: You can't fire a gun in here. What if you hit a wall?  
JEFFERSON: I'm firing stock fifteen. It only impacts upon organics. Keep
watch. Guard them.  
(There are at least three Ood there. A woman replies.)  
GUARD: Yes, sir.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Is everything all right up there?  
ROSE: Yeah, yeah.

**[Control room]**

ZACH: It's fine.

**[Ood Habitation]**

DANNY: Great.

**[Point Zero]**

(The Doctor and Ida have gone between a pair of massive pillars into an area
with a lot of rubble and a big round decorated door in the floor.)  
DOCTOR: We've found something. It looks like metal. Like some sort of seal.
I've got a nasty feeling the word might be trapdoor. Not a good word,
trapdoor. Never met a trapdoor I liked.  
IDA: The edge is covered with those symbols.  
ZACH [OC]: Do you think it opens?  
DOCTOR: That's what trapdoors tend to do.  
IDA: Trapdoor doesn't do it justice. It's massive, Zach. About thirty feet in
diameter.  
ZACH [OC]: Any way of opening it?  
IDA: I don't know. I can't see any sort of mechanism.  
DOCTOR: I suppose that's the writing. It'll tell us what to do. The letters
that defy translation.

**[Control room]**

ZACH: Toby, did you get anywhere with decoding it?

**[Drilling area]**

ROSE: Toby, they need to know that lettering. Does it make any sort of sense?  
TOBY: I know what it says.  
ROSE: Then tell them.  
JEFFERSON: When did you work that out?  
ROSE: It doesn't matter, just tell them.  
(Toby is covered in the symbols again.)  
TOBY: These are the words of the Beast. And he has woken. He is the heart that
beats in the darkness. He is the blood that will never cease. And now he will
rise.  
JEFFERSON: Officer, stand down. Stand down.

**[Point Zero]**

DOCTOR: What is it? What's he done? What's happening? Rose, what's going on?

**[Control room]**

ZACH: Jefferson? Report. Report!

**[Drilling area]**

JEFFERSON: Officer, as Commander of Security, I order you to stand down and be
confined. Immediately!  
ROSE: He's come out in those symbols all over his face. They're all over him.  
TOBY: Mister Jefferson. Tell me, sir. Did your wife ever forgive you?  
JEFFERSON: I don't know what you mean.  
TOBY: Let me tell you a secret. She never did.  
JEFFERSON: Officer, you stand down and be confined.  
TOBY: Or what?  
JEFFERSON: Or under the strictures of Condition Red, I am authorised to shoot
you.  
TOBY: But how many can you kill?  
(Toby opens his mouth. The symbols leave him and float over to the Ood, who
jerk to attention. Toby collapses.)

**[Ood Habitation]**

ALL OOD: We are the Legion of the Beast.

**[Point Zero]**

DOCTOR: Rose? What is it, Rose? I'm going back up.  
ZACH [OC]: Report. Report!

**[Control room]**

ZACH: Jefferson, report. Someone, report!

**[Ood Habitation]**

ALL OOD: The Legion shall be many, and the Legion shall be few.

**[Drilling area]**

ROSE: It's the Ood.  
JEFFERSON: Sir, we have contamination in the livestock.  
ROSE: Doctor, I don't know what it is. It's like they're possessed.  
JEFFERSON: They won't listen to us.

**[Ood Habitation]**

ALL OOD: He has woven himself in the fabric of your life since the dawn of
time. Some may call him Abaddon. Some may call him Kroptor. Some may call him
Satan or Lucifer.  
DANNY: Captain, it's the Ood. They're out of control!  
OOD: Or the Bringer of Despair, the Deathless Prince, the Bringer of Night.  
(One Ood walks up the steps to the catwalk. It releases its globe, which flies
to the guard's forehead and electrocutes him.)  
OOD: These are the words that shall set him free.

**[Drilling area]**

JEFFERSON: Back up to the door!  
ALL OOD: I shall become manifest.  
JEFFERSON: Move quickly!  
ALL OOD: I shall walk in might.  
JEFFERSON: To the door! Get it open!  
ALL OOD: My Legions shall swarm across the worlds.

**[Point Zero]**

(The centre of the trapdoor sinks. The ground shakes.)  
IDA: Doctor, it's opening!

**[Control room]**

ZACH: We're moving! The whole thing's moving. The planet's moving.  
(The overhead shutters open. The Doctor runs back to Ida as the whole trapdoor
opens its segments.)

**[Drilling area]**

ALL OOD: I am the sin and the temptation and the desire. I am the pain and the
loss and the  
JEFFERSON: Get that door open!  
(The open trapdoor reveals a deep shaft.)

**[Control room]**

ZACH: The gravity field. It's going! We're losing orbit! We're going to fall
into the black hole!

**[Drilling area]**

ALL OOD: I have been imprisoned for eternity. But no more.  
COMPUTER: Door sealed.  
ROSE: Come on!  
COMPUTER: Door sealed.

**[Point Zero]**

VOICE [OC]: The Pit is open. And I am free. Bwahahahahahaha!
