**Journey's End**  
  
Original Airdate: 5 Jul, 2008  

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor has golden energy streaming from his hands and head, and he, Jack
and Rose believe he is regenerating. With an effort, the Doctor turns and
points both hands towards his spare hand in the jar by the time console. It
absorbs it and he is released.)  
DOCTOR: Now then. Where were we?  
(Donna, Jack and Rose are stunned.)

**[Sarah Jane's car]**

DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate!  
(Suddenly, two figures with honking big guns appear either side of the car and
blast the Daleks.)  
SARAH: Mickey?  
MICKEY: Us Smiths got to stick together!  
JACKIE: Jackie Tyler, Rose's mum. Now where the hell is my daughter?

**[Torchwood]**

(Gwen and Ianto empty their machinegun clips at the Dalek, who isn't shooting
back. When they stop, they see the bullets hanging in midair. Gwen touches the
air and it ripples like water.)  
GWEN: What the hell?

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor checks on his glowing spare hand.)  
DOCTOR: There now.  
(He blows on the jar and the glowing stops.)  
DOCTOR: You see? Used the regeneration energy to heal myself, but soon as I
was done, I didn't need to change. I didn't want to. Why would I? Look at me.
So, to stop the energy going all the way, I siphoned off the rest into a handy
bio-matching receptacle, namely my hand. My hand there. My handy spare hand.
Remember? Christmas Day, Sycorax. Lost my hand in a sword fight? That's my
hand. What do you think?  
ROSE: You're still you?  
DOCTOR: I'm still me.  
(The Doctor and Rose hug. Donna turns to Jack.)  
DONNA: You can hug me, if you want. No, really. You can hug me.

**[Torchwood]**

(Ianto is checking the data banks.)  
IANTO: It's a Time Lock. The ultimate defence programme. Tosh was working on
it. Never thought she finished it, but she did. The Hub's sealed in a time
bubble. Nothing can get in.  
GWEN: But that means we can't get out.  
IANTO: Nope. Not without unlocking that Dalek. We're trapped inside. It's all
up to Jack now.

**[Street]**

(The Tardis is in the middle of a litter-strewn street, surrounded by four
Daleks.)  
DALEK: Report. Tardis has been located.

**[Dalek spaceship]**

RED DALEK: Bring it here. Bring the Doctor to me! Initiate temporal prison.

**[Street]**

(The four Daleks create a shining blue energy ring around the Tardis.)  
DALEK: Temporal prison initiated.

**[Tardis]**

(The power goes out.)  
DOCTOR: They've got us. Power's gone. Some kind of chronon loop.  
(The Tardis tilts with a jerk.)

**[Street]**

(Sarah, Jackie and Mickey hide behind an abandoned van.)  
DALEK: Transferring Tardis to the Crucible.  
(The Tardis is lifted away by an energy beam up into the space between the
planets.)  
SARAH: Those teleport things. Can we use them? If they've taken the Doctor to
the Dalek spaceship, then that's where we need to be.  
MICKEY: It's not just a teleport, it's a dimension jump. Man, this thing rips
a hole in the fabric of space.  
SARAH: But can we use it?  
MICKEY: Not yet. It burns up energy. Needs half an hour between jumps.  
SARAH: Then put down your guns.  
MICKEY: Do what?  
SARAH: If you're carrying a gun, they'll shoot you dead.  
(Sarah steps out into the street.)  
SARAH: Daleks, I surrender.  
DALEK: All humans in this sector will be taken to the Crucible.  
MICKEY: She's bloody mad!  
JACKIE: Yeah, but Mickey, if they've got the Doctor, then they've got Rose.  
(Jackie puts down her gun and walks out.)  
JACKIE: And us. We surrender.  
(Mickey kisses his gun then follows.)

**[Francine's home]**

(Martha puts the Project Indigo backpack on.)  
MARTHA: Now Jack's explained the base code, I know how this teleport works. I
think. But you just stay indoors. There's no Daleks on this street. You should
be all right. Just er, keep quiet.  
FRANCINE: But where are you going?  
MARTHA: I'm a member of UNIT, and they gave me the Osterhagen Key. I've got to
do my job. I'm sorry.  
FRANCINE: Martha. What's an Osterhagen Key? Tell me. What does it do?  
MARTHA: Love you.  
(Martha pulls her ripcords and vanishes.)

**[Germany - 60 miles outside Nuremberg]**

(Martha lands in a wood. Daleks can be heard shouting their favourite word in
German.)  
DALEK [OC]: Exterminieren! Exterminieren!  
DALEK 2 [OC]: Halt! Sonst werden wir Sie exterminieren! Sie sind jetzt ein
Gefangener der Daleks!  
(Martha sees a Dalek patrol gliding above the forest floor.)  
DALEK: Exterminieren. Exterminieren.

**[Tardis]**

JACK: There's a massive Dalek ship at the centre of the planets. They're
calling it the Crucible. Guess that's our destination.  
DONNA: You said these planets were like an engine. But what for?  
DOCTOR: Rose, you've been in a parallel world. That world's running ahead of
this universe. You've seen the future. What was it?  
ROSE: It's the darkness.  
DONNA: The stars were going out.  
ROSE: One by one. We looked up at the sky and they were just dying. Basically,
we've been building this, er, this travel machine, this, this er, dimension
cannon, so I could. Well, so I could  
DOCTOR: What?  
ROSE: So I could come back. Shut up. Anyway, suddenly, it started to work and
the dimensions started to collapse. Not just in our world, not just in yours,
but the whole of reality. Even the Void was dead. Something is destroying
everything.  
DONNA: In that parallel world, you said something about me.  
ROSE: The dimension cannon could measure timelines, and it's, it's weird,
Donna, but they all seemed to converge on you.  
DONNA: But why me? I mean, what have I ever done? I'm a temp from Chiswick.  
(The scanner beeps.)  
DOCTOR: The Dalek Crucible. All aboard.

**[Crucible]**

DALEK: The Tardis is secured.  
RED DALEK: Doctor, you will step forth or die.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: We'll have to go out. Because if we don't, they'll get in.  
ROSE: You told me nothing could get through those doors.  
JACK: You've got extrapolator shielding.  
DOCTOR: Last time we fought the Daleks, they were scavengers and hybrids, and
mad. But this is a fully-fledged Dalek Empire, at the height of its power.
Experts at fighting Tardises, they can do anything. Right now, that wooden
door is just wood.  
(Donna can hear a heartbeat thumping in her ears.)  
JACK: What about your dimension jump?  
ROSE: It needs another twenty minutes. And anyway, I'm not leaving.  
DOCTOR: What about your teleport?  
JACK: Went down with the power loss.  
DOCTOR: Right then. All of us together. Yeah. Donna?  
(Donna is staring at nothing. He snaps her out of it.)  
DOCTOR: Donna?  
DONNA: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. There's nothing else we can do.  
DONNA: No, I know.

**[Crucible]**

RED DALEK: Surrender, Doctor, and face your Dalek masters.  
DALEK 3: Crucible on maximum alert.

**[Tardis]**

ROSE: Daleks.  
JACK: Oh, God.  
DOCTOR: It's been good, though, hasn't it? All of us. All of it. Everything we
did. (to Donna) You were brilliant. (to Jack) And you were brilliant. (to
Rose) And you were brilliant. Blimey.

**[Crucible]**

(The Doctor leads his companions out of the Tardis. Donna is lagging behind.)  
RED DALEK: Daleks reign supreme. All hail the Daleks!  
DALEKS: Daleks reign supreme. All hail the Daleks! Daleks reign supreme. All
hail the Daleks!  
(Donna stops inside the Tardis, the heartbeat thumping in her ears. The Doctor
looks up at the phalanxes of Daleks flying around.)  
DALEKS: Daleks reign supreme. All hail the Daleks! Daleks reign supreme. All
hail the Daleks!  
RED DALEK: Behold, Doctor. Behold the might of the true Dalek race.  
DOCTOR: Donna! You're no safer in there.  
(The Tardis door slams shut, trapping Donna inside.)  
DOCTOR: What?

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: Doctor? What have you done?

**[Crucible]**

DOCTOR: It wasn't me. I didn't do anything.

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: Oi! Oi, I'm not staying behind!

**[Crucible]**

DOCTOR: What did you do?!  
RED DALEK: This is not of Dalek origin.

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: Doctor!

**[Crucible]**

DOCTOR: Stop it! She's my friend. Now open the door and let her out.  
RED DALEK: This is Time Lord treachery.  
DOCTOR: Me? The door just closed on its own.  
RED DALEK: Nevertheless, the Tardis is a weapon and it will be destroyed.  
(A trapdoor opens under the Tardis and it drops.)  
DOCTOR: What are you doing? Bring it back!

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: Doctor!

**[Crucible]**

DOCTOR: What have you done? Where's it going?  
RED DALEK: The Crucible has a heart of Z-neutrino energy. The Tardis will be
deposited into the core.  
DOCTOR: You can't. You've taken the defences down. It'll be torn apart!  
(The Tardis drops into the molten core. Fires break out and roundels explode.)  
ROSE: But Donna's still in there!  
JACK: Let her go!  
RED DALEK: The female and the Tardis will perish together. Observe. The last
child of Gallifrey is powerless.  
(An image of the Tardis bobbing in the molten core appears.)  
DOCTOR: Please. I'm begging you. I'll do anything! Put me in her place. You
can do anything to me, I don't care, just get her out of there!  
(The noise of the exploding roundels is replaced by the heartbeat. Donna puts
her hand on the spare hand jar. Golden energy flows out and around her until
the jar breaks.)  
RED DALEK: You are connected to the Tardis. Now feel it die.

**[Tardis]**

(The spare hand is lying on the floor, twitching. The golden energy surges out
and builds a new body for it, which looks just like the old one.)  
DONNA: It's you!  
NEW DOCTOR: Oh, yes!  
DONNA: You're naked.  
NEW DOCTOR: Oh, yes.

**[Crucible]**

DALEK 3: Total Tardis destruction in ten rels. Nine, eight, seven, six  
(The new Doctor presses a button on the console.)  
DALEK 3: Five, four, three, two, one.  
(The Tardis vanishes.)  
RED DALEK: The Tardis has been destroyed. Now tell me, Doctor. What do you
feel? Anger? Sorrow? Despair?  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
RED DALEK: Then if emotions are so important, surely we have enhanced you?  
JACK: Yeah? Feel this! (Jack produces a small revolver and shoots at the Red
Dalek.)  
RED DALEK: Exterminate!  
(The Red Dalek zaps Jack.)  
ROSE: Jack. Oh, my God. Oh, no.  
DOCTOR: Rose, come here. Leave him.  
ROSE: They killed him.  
DOCTOR: I know. I'm sorry.  
RED DALEK: Escort them to the Vault.  
DOCTOR: There's nothing we can do.  
RED DALEK: They are the playthings of Davros now.  
(Jack blinks. The Tardis appears in space.)

**[Tardis]**

NEW DOCTOR: All repaired. Lovely. Shush. No one knows we're here. Got to keep
quiet. Silent running, like on submarines when you can't even drop a spanner.
Don't drop a spanner! I like blue. What do you think?  
DONNA: You are bonkers.  
NEW DOCTOR: Why? What's wrong with blue?  
DONNA: Is that what Time Lords do? Lop a bit off, grow another one? You're
like worms.  
NEW DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. I'm unique. Never been another like me.
Because all that regeneration energy went into the hand. Look at my hand. I
love that hand. But then you touched it. Wham! Shush. Instantaneous biological
metacrisis. I grew out of you. Still, could be worse.  
DONNA: Oi, watch it, spaceman.  
NEW DOCTOR: Oi, watch it, Earth girl. Ooo. I sound like you. I sound all, all
sort of rough.  
DONNA: Oi!  
NEW DOCTOR: Oi!  
DONNA: Oi!  
NEW DOCTOR: Spanners. Shush. I must have picked up a bit of your voice, that's
all. Is it? Did I? No. Oh, you are kidding me. No way. One heart. I've only
got one heart. This body has got only one heart.  
DONNA: What, like you're human?  
NEW DOCTOR: Oh, that's disgusting.  
DONNA: Oi!  
NEW DOCTOR: Oi!  
DONNA: Stop it.  
NEW DOCTOR: No, wait. I'm part Time Lord, part human. Well, isn't that wizard?  
DONNA: I kept hearing that noise, that heartbeat.  
NEW DOCTOR: Oh, that was me. My single heart. Because I'm a complicated event
in time and space. Must have rippled back, converging on you.  
DONNA: But why me?  
NEW DOCTOR: Because you're special.  
DONNA: Oh, I keep telling you, I'm not.  
NEW DOCTOR: No, but you are. Oh. You really don't believe that, do you? I can
see, Donna, what you're thinking. All that attitude, all that lip, because all
this time you think you're not worth it.  
DONNA: Stop it.  
NEW DOCTOR: Shouting at the world because no one's listening. Well, why should
they?  
DONNA: Doctor? Stop it.  
NEW DOCTOR: But look at what you did. No, it's more than that. It's like we
were always heading for this. You came to the Tardis. And you found me again.
Your granddad. Your car. Donna, your car. You parked your car right where the
Tardis was going land. That's not coincidence at all! We've been blind.
Something's been drawing us together for such a long time.  
DONNA: But you're talking like destiny. There's no such thing. Is there?  
NEW DOCTOR: It's still not finished. It's like the pattern's not complete. The
strands are still drawing together. But heading for what?

**[Outside the Schloss]**

GERMAN WOMAN: Hier ist niemand. Was immer Sie wollen, gehen Sie fort. Lassen
Sie mich in Ruhe!  
MARTHA: Ich heisse Martha Jones. Ich komme von UNIT. Agentin fuenf sechs sechs
sieben eins, von der medizinishen Abteilung.  
GERMAN WOMAN: Es hiess Sie kaemen vorbei. That accent. That is London, ja? I
went to London. Long time ago.  
MARTHA: I thought this place was supposed to be guarded.  
GERMAN WOMAN: They were soldiers. Boys. I brought them food every day. But
when der Albtraum came from the sky, they went home to die. But not you.  
MARTHA: I've got a job to do.

**[UNIT Germany]**

(The woman follows Martha through the dusty rooms to see her pull down a
hanging and enter a code into a large keypad. Then it checks her handprint.)  
GERMAN WOMAN: London. In those days, to see it. So much glamour. I was so
young. I heard the soldiers talking many times. They would speak of the
Osterhagen Key. I think London must be changed now, yes? But still, the
glamour.  
(The woman points a gun at Martha as she opens the secure door.)  
GERMAN WOMAN: You will not go.  
MARTHA: I've got no choice.  
GERMAN WOMAN: I know the Key. What it does. Sie sind der Albtraum, nicht die
anderen, Sie! Ich sollte Sie umbringen, am besten gleich jetzt!  
MARTHA: Then do it.  
(But she can't. Martha steps into a small lift.)  
GERMAN WOMAN: Martha, Zur Hoelle mit Dir!  
MARTHA: I know.

**[Crucible]**

DALEK: Commence disposal. Incinerate!  
(Jack is in a large tub with the other rubbish. It is slid along the floor and
a steel door clangs down behind it.)  
DALEK: Disposal completed.  
(The Daleks leave. The steel door rises and Jack climbs out, coughing.)

**[Osterhagen One]**

(The lift brings Martha to a small high-tech room. She presses a button.)  
MARTHA: This is Osterhagen Station One. My name is Martha Jones. Is there
anyone there? Over.

**[Crucible]**

DALEK 3: Prisoners now on board the Crucible. They will be taken for testing.  
SARAH: One step closer to the Doctor.

**[Vault]**

DAVROS: Activate the holding cells.  
(Spotlights shine down on the Doctor and Rose.)  
DAVROS: Excellent. Even when powerless, a Time Lord is best contained.  
DOCTOR: Still scared of me, then?  
DAVROS: It is time we talked, Doctor. After so very long.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. We're not doing the nostalgia tour. I want to know
what's happening right here, right now, because the Supreme Dalek said Vault,
yeah? As in dungeon, cellar, prison. You're not in charge of the Daleks, are
you? They've got you locked away down here in the basement like, what, a
servant? Slave? Court jester?  
DAVROS: We have an arrangement.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. No, I've got the word. You're the Dalek's pet!  
DAVROS: So very full of fire, is he not. And to think you crossed entire
universes, striding parallel to parallel to find him again.  
DOCTOR: Leave her alone.  
DAVROS: She is mine to do as I please.  
ROSE: Then why am I still alive?  
DAVROS: You must be here. It was foretold. Even the Supreme Dalek would not
dare to contradict the prophecies of Dalek Caan.  
CAAN: So cold and dark. Fire is coming. The endless flames.  
ROSE: What is that thing?  
DOCTOR: You've met before. The last of the Cult of Skaro. But it flew into the
Time War, unprotected.  
DAVROS: Caan did more than that. He saw time. Its infinite complexity and
majesty, raging through his mind. And he saw you. Both of you.  
CAAN: This I have foreseen, in the wild and the wind. The Doctor will be here
as witness, at the end of everything. The Doctor and his precious Children of
Time. And one of them will die.  
DOCTOR: Was it you, Caan? Did you kill Donna? Why did the Tardis door close?
Tell me!  
DAVROS: Oh, that's it. The anger, the fire, the rage of a Time Lord who
butchered millions. There he is. Why so shy? Show your companion. Show her
your true self. Dalek Caan has promised me that too.  
CAAN: I have seen. At the time of ending, the Doctor's soul will be revealed.  
DOCTOR: What does that mean?  
DAVROS: We will discover it together. Our final journey. Because the ending
approaches. The testing begins.  
DOCTOR: Testing of what?  
DAVROS: The Reality bomb.

**[Holding area]**

DALEK: Prisoners will stand in the designated area. Move! Move!  
(One woman falls to her knees.)  
WOMAN: Oh!  
DALEK: You will stand!  
WOMAN: I can't.  
DALEK: You will stand!  
WOMAN: I can't. Please!  
(Sarah spots a nearby door and runs to it.)  
DALEK: On your feet. On your feet!  
(She opens it with her sonic lipstick.)  
SARAH: (sotto) Mickey! Mickey!  
MICKEY: (sotto) Jackie!  
(Mickey follows Sarah, but Jackie is with the woman.)  
DALEK: Prisoners will stand in the designated area.

**[Corridor** **]**

MICKEY: We can't just leave her.  
SARAH: No, Mickey. Wait!  
(A Dalek glides in front of the bulkhead door.)  
WOMAN: What does it mean? What are they testing? What are they going to do?  
(There is a big green glowing thing above them.)  
JACKIE: I reckon it's that thing there.

**[Crucible]**

RED DALEK: Testing calibration of Reality bomb. Firing in ten rels. Nine,
eight, seven

**[Vault]**

DAVROS: Behold. The apotheosis of my genius.  
(Davros turns on a screen showing the holding area.)  
RED DALEK [OC]: Four, three, two, one, zero.

**[Crucible]**

RED DALEK: Activate planetary alignment field.

**[Tardis]**

NEW DOCTOR: It's the planets. The twenty seven planets.

**[Vault]**

(The planets start to glow.)  
DOCTOR: That's Z-neutrino energy, flattened by the alignment of the planets
into a single string. No, Davros. Davros, you can't! You can't! No!

**[Tardis]**

NEW DOCTOR: Single string Z-neutrinos compressed. No way.

**[Corridor** **]**

(Beep, beep, beep!)  
MICKEY: Thirty minutes. It's recharged!

**[Holding area]**

(Mickey shouts to Jackie through the glass porthole in the door.)  
MICKEY: (sotto) It's recharged! It's recharged! Use it!  
JACKIE: I'm so sorry.  
(Jackie vanishes and reappears with Mickey. They watch as the rest of the
prisoners gently atomise from the head downwards.)

**[Holding area]**

DALEK: Test completed.

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: What was it? Doctor, what did it do?

**[Vault]**

ROSE: Doctor, what happened?  
DAVROS: Electrical energy, Miss Tyler. Every atom in existence is bound by an
electrical field. The Reality bomb cancels it out. Structure falls apart. That
test was focused on the prisoners alone. Full transmission will dissolve every
form of matter.  
ROSE: The stars are going out.  
DOCTOR: The twenty seven planets. They become one vast transmitter, blasting
that wavelength.  
DAVROS: Across the entire universe. Never stopping, never faltering, never
fading. People and planets and stars will become dust, and the dust will
become atoms, and the atoms will become nothing. And the wavelength will
continue, breaking through the Rift at the heart of the Medusa Cascade into
every dimension, every parallel, every single corner of creation. This is my
ultimate victory, Doctor! The destruction of reality itself!

**[Crucible]**

RED DALEK: Prepare for universal detonation. The fleet will gather at the
Crucible. All Daleks will return to shelter from the cataclysm. We will become
the only life forms in existence.

**[Chiswick]**

SYLVIA: Look, they're leaving. Dad, they're going. The Daleks are going!  
WILF: Going where, though? And Donna's still out there. It's not over yet,
sweetheart.

**[Corridor** **]**

(Jack rolls through a panel in the wall behind Sarah, Jackie and Mickey.)  
JACK: Just my luck. I climb through two miles of ventilation shafts, chasing
life signs on this thing, and who do I find? Mickey Mouse.  
MICKEY: You can talk, Captain Cheesecake.  
(Mickey and Jack hug.)  
JACK: Good to see you. And that's Beefcake.  
MICKEY: And that's enough hugging.  
JACK: We meet at last, Miss Smith.  
SARAH: There is something we can do. You've got to understand. I have a son
down there on Earth. He's only fourteen years old. I've brought this.  
(Sarah holds up a sparkling gem on a chain.)  
SARAH: It was given to me by a Verron Soothsayer. He said, this is for the End
of Days.  
JACK: Is that a Warp Star?  
MICKEY: Going to tell me what a Warp Star is?  
JACK: A warpfold conjugation trapped in a carbonised shell. It's an explosion,
Mickey. An explosion waiting to happen.

**[Osterhagen One]**

ANNA [on screen]: This is Osterhagen Station Five. Are you receiving, Station
One?  
MARTHA: I've got you. That makes three of us, and three is all we need.

**[Osterhagen Five]**

(In the People's Republic of China.)  
ANNA: My name is Anna Zhou, what's yours?  
MARTHA [OC]: Martha Jones.

**[Osterhagen One]**

MARTHA: What about you, Station Four? You never said.  
LIBERIA [on screen]: I don't want my name on this, given what we're about to
do.  
ANNA [on screen]: So what happens now? Do we do it?  
MARTHA: No. Not yet.  
ANNA [on screen]: UNIT instructions say, once three Osterhagen Stations are
online  
MARTHA: Yeah, but I've got a higher authority, way above UNIT. And there's one
more thing the Doctor would do.

**[Tardis]**

(He builds a gizmo.)  
DONNA: So what is this thing?  
NEW DOCTOR: It's our only hope. A Z-neutrino biological inversion catalyser.  
DONNA: Yeah. Earth girl, remember?  
NEW DOCTOR: Davros said he built those Daleks out of himself. His genetic code
runs through the entire race. If I can use this to lock the Crucible's
transmission onto Davros himself  
DONNA: It destroys the Daleks?  
NEW DOCTOR: Biggest backfire in history.

**[Crucible]**

DALEK: Incoming transmission. Origin Planet Earth.  
RED DALEK: Display!  
MARTHA [on screen]: This is Martha Jones, representing the Unified
Intelligence Taskforce, on behalf of the human race.  
RED DALEK: Send transmission to the Vault. Continue to monitor.

**[Vault]**

MARTHA [on screen]: This message is for the Dalek Crucible. Repeat. Can you
hear me?  
DOCTOR: Put me through.  
DAVROS: It begins As Dalek Caan foretold.  
CAAN: The Children of Time will gather, and one of them will die.  
DOCTOR: Stop saying that. Put me through!  
MARTHA [on screen]: Doctor! I'm sorry, I had to.  
DAVROS: Oh, but the Doctor is powerless. My prisoner. State your intent.

**[Osterhagen One]**

MARTHA: I've got the Osterhagen Key. Leave this planet and its people alone

**[Vault]**

MARTHA [on screen]: Or I'll use it.  
DOCTOR: Osterhagen what? What's an Osterhagen Key?  
MARTHA [on screen]: There's a chain of twenty five nuclear warheads placed in
strategic points beneath the Earth's crust. If I use the key, they detonate
and the Earth gets ripped apart.  
DOCTOR: What? Who invented that? Well, someone called Osterhagen, I suppose.
Martha, are you insane?

**[Osterhagen One]**

MARTHA: The Osterhagen Key is to be used if the suffering of the human race is
so great, so without hope, that this becomes the final option.

**[Vault]**

DOCTOR: That's never an option.

**[Osterhagen One]**

MARTHA: Don't argue with me, Doctor!

**[Vault]**

MARTHA [on screen]: Because it's more than that. Now, I reckon the Daleks need

**[Osterhagen One]**

MARTHA: These twenty seven planets for something. But what if it becomes
twenty six?

**[Vault]**

MARTHA [on screen]: What happens then? Daleks? Would you risk it?  
ROSE: She's good.  
MARTHA [on screen]: Who's that?  
ROSE: My name's Rose. Rose Tyler.

**[Osterhagen One]**

MARTHA: Oh, my God. He found you.

**[Crucible]**

DALEK 2: Second transmission, internal.  
RED DALEK: Display.  
JACK [on screen]: Captain Jack Harkness, calling all Dalek boys and girls.

**[Corridor** **]**

(There are wires attached to the Warp Star now.)  
JACK: Are you receiving me?

**[Vault]**

JACK [on screen]: Don't send in your goons, or I'll set this thing off.  
ROSE: He's still alive. Oh, my god. That, that's my mum.

**[Corridor** **]**

DOCTOR [OC]: And Mickey. Captain, what are you doing?  
JACK: I've got a Warp Star wired into the mainframe.

**[Vault]**

JACK [on screen]: I break this shell, the entire Crucible goes up.  
DOCTOR: You can't! Where did you get a Warp Star?  
SARAH: From me.

**[Corridor** **]**

SARAH: We had no choice. We saw what happened to the prisoners.

**[Vault]**

DAVROS: Impossible. That face.

**[Corridor** **]**

DAVROS [OC]: After all these years.  
SARAH: Davros. It's been quite a while. Sarah Jane Smith. Remember?

**[Vault]**

DAVROS: Oh, this is meant to be. The circle of Time is closing. You were there

**[Corridor** **]**

DAVROS [OC]: On Skaro at the very beginning of my creation.

**[Vault]**

SARAH: And I've learnt how to fight since then. You let the Doctor go, or this
Warp Star

**[Corridor** **]**

SARAH [on screen]: It gets opened.

**[Vault]**

JACK [on screen]: I'll do it.

**[Corridor** **]**

JACK: Don't imagine I wouldn't.

**[Vault]**

ROSE: Now that's what I call a ransom. Doctor?  
DAVROS: And the prophecy unfolds.  
CAAN: The Doctor's soul is revealed. See him. See the heart of him.  
DAVROS: The man who abhors violence, never carrying a gun.

**[Corridor** **]**

DAVROS [OC]: But this is the truth, Doctor. You take ordinary people

**[Vault]**

DAVROS: And you fashion them into weapons.

**[Osterhagen One]**

DAVROS [OC]: Behold your Children of Time

**[Vault]**

DAVROS: Transformed into murderers. I made the Daleks, Doctor. You made this.  
DOCTOR: They're trying to help.  
DAVROS: Already I have seen them sacrifice today, for their beloved Doctor.
The Earth woman who fell opening the Subwave Network.  
DOCTOR: Who was that?  
ROSE: Harriet Jones. She gave her life to get you here.  
DAVROS: How many more? Just think. How many have died in your name?  
(A lot, and that's just in these few modern series, including River Song and
his daughter, although we know better.)  
DAVROS: The Doctor. The man who keeps running, never looking back because he
dare not, out of shame. This is my final victory, Doctor. I have shown you
yourself.

**[Crucible]**

RED DALEK: Enough. Engage defence zero five.

**[Osterhagen One]**

MARTHA: It's the Crucible or the Earth.

**[Crucible]**

DALEK 3: Transmat engaged.

**[Osterhagen One]**

MARTHA: No!  
(She drops the key as the transmat snatches her away. Jack drops the Warp Star
as he and his group also vanish.)

**[Vault]**

JACK: I've got you. It's all right.  
DOCTOR: Don't move, all of you. Stay still.  
(The Doctor's hand touches the forcefield around him, lighting it up.)  
DAVROS: Guard them! On your knees, all of you. Surrender!  
DOCTOR: Do as he says.  
ROSE: Mum, I told you not to.  
JACKIE: Yeah, but I couldn't leave you.  
DAVROS: The final prophecy is in place. The Doctor and his children, all
gathered as witnesses. Supreme Dalek, the time has come. Now, detonate the
Reality bomb!

**[Crucible]**

(An iris in the planetoid cum spaceship opens to reveal the green bomb.)  
RED DALEK: Activate planetary alignment field.  
(The planets glow.)  
RED DALEK: Universal Reality detonation in two hundred rels.

**[Vault]**

DOCTOR: You can't, Davros! Just listen to me! Just stop!  
DAVROS: Ah, ha, ha, ha! Nothing can stop the detonation. Nothing and no one!

**[Tardis]**

(The gizmo is ready, and it looks like a gun.)  
NEW DOCTOR: Ready? Maximum power!

**[Vault]**

DOCTOR: But that's  
DAVROS: Impossible.  
(The Tardis materialises and the new Doctor appears in the doorway.)  
JACK: Brilliant.  
(Then he runs across the floor.)  
DOCTOR: Don't!  
(Davros zaps the new Doctor. He drops the gizmo in pain.)  
DAVROS: Activate holding cell.  
(Donna runs out of the Tardis and grabs the gizmo.)  
DONNA: Doctor! I've got it. But I don't know what to do!  
(Davros zaps Donna, sending her flying backwards. Once again the gizmo drops
to the floor.)  
DOCTOR: Donna! Donna! Are you all right, Donna?  
DAVROS: Destroy the weapon.  
(A Dalek obeys.)  
DAVROS: I was wrong about your warriors, Doctor. They are pathetic.  
ROSE: How comes there are two of you?  
DOCTOR: Human biological metacrisis. Never mind that. Now we've got no way of
stopping the Reality Bomb.

**[Crucible]**

RED DALEK: Detonation in twenty rels. Nineteen.

**[Vault]**

DAVROS: Stand witness, Time Lord. Stand witness, humans. Your strategies have
failed, your weapons are useless, and. Oh. The end of the universe has come.  
RED DALEK [OC]: Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. (An
alarm sounds.)  
DONNA: Mmm, closing all Z-neutrino relay loops using an internalised
synchronous back-feed reversal loop. That button there.  
(She presses a button on the panel she was thrown against.)

**[Crucible]**

DALEK 3: System in shutdown.  
DALEK 2: Detonation negative.  
RED DALEK: Explain. Explain. Explain!

**[Vault]**

DOCTOR: Donna, you can't even change a plug.  
DONNA: Do you want to bet, Time Boy?  
DAVROS: You'll suffer for this.  
(Donna lifts a lever and Davros' electrical zap travels up his arm.)  
DAVROS: Argh!  
DONNA: Oh, bio-electric dampening field with a retrograde field arc inversion.  
DAVROS: Exterminate her!  
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.  
(Donna works more controls on the panel.)  
DALEK: Weapons non-functional.  
DONNA: Phwor. Macrotransmission of a K-filter wavelength blocking Dalek
weaponry in a self-replicating energy blindfold matrix.  
DOCTOR: How did you work that out? You're  
NEW DOCTOR: Time Lord. Part Time Lord.  
DONNA: Part human. Oh, yes. That was a two-way biological metacrisis. Half
Doctor, half Donna.  
DOCTOR: The Doctor Donna. Just like the Ood said, remember? They saw it
coming. The Doctor Donna.  
DONNA: Holding cells deactivated. And seal the Vault. Well, don't just stand
there, you skinny boys in suits. Get to work.  
DAVROS: Stop them! Get them away from the controls.  
DONNA: And spin.  
(The Daleks spin around on the spot.)  
DALEK: Help me. Help me!  
DONNA: And the other way.  
NEW DOCTOR: What did you do?  
DONNA: Trip switch circuit-breaker in the psychokinetic threshold manipulator.  
NEW DOCTOR: But that's brilliant!  
DOCTOR: Why did we never think of that?  
DONNA: Because you two were just Time Lords, you dumbos, lacking that little
bit of human. That gut instinct that comes hand in hand with Planet Earth. I
can think of ideas you two couldn't dream of in a million years. Ah, the
universe has been waiting for me. Now, let's send that trip switch all over
the ship. Did I ever tell you, best temp in Chiswick? Hundred words per
minute.  
NEW DOCTOR: Ha!

**[Crucible]**

DALEK: System malfunction.  
DALEK 2: Motor casing interference.  
RED DALEK: What is happening? Explain!

**[Vault]**

(Jack runs into the Tardis.)  
DONNA: Come on then, boys. We've got twenty seven planets to send home.
Activate magnetron.  
DAVROS: Stop this at once!  
(Jack comes out of the Tardis with the honking big guns.)  
JACK: Mickey!  
DAVROS: You will desist!  
(Mickey points his gun at Davros, point blank range.)  
MICKEY: Just stay where you are, mister.  
JACK: Out of the way.  
(He pushes a spinning Dalek down a corridor, while Sarah and Rose manhandle
another one.)  
SARAH: Good to see you again.  
ROSE: Oh, you too.  
DONNA: Ready? And reverse.  
(Donna and the Doctors pull out pairs of rods, and the planets disappear one
by one.)  
DOCTOR: Off you go, Clom.  
NEW DOCTOR: Back home, Adipose Three.  
DONNA: Shallacatop, Pyrovillia and the Lost Moon of Poosh. Sorted. Ha!  
NEW DOCTOR: Ha!  
DOCTOR: We need more power!  
ROSE: Is anyone going to tell us what's going on?  
DONNA: He poured all his regeneration energy into his spare hand. I touched
the hand, and he grew out of that but that fed back into me. But, it just
stayed dormant in my head till the synapses got that little extra spark,
kicking them into life. Thank you, Davros! Part human, part Time Lord. And I
got the best bit of the Doctor. I got his mind.  
SARAH: So there's three of you?  
ROSE: Three Doctors?  
JACK: I can't tell you what I'm thinking right now.  
DOCTOR: You're so unique the timelines were converging on you. Human being
with a Time Lord brain.  
DAVROS: But you promised me, Dalek Caan. Why did you not foresee this?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I think he did. Something's been manipulating the timelines for
ages, getting Donna Noble to the right place at the right time.  
CAAN: This would always have happened. I only helped, Doctor.  
DAVROS: You betrayed the Daleks.  
CAAN: I saw the Daleks. What we have done, throughout time and space, I saw
the truth of us, Creator, and I decreed, no more!

**[Crucible]**

RED DALEK: I will descend to the Vault.

**[Vault]**

JACK: Heads up!  
RED DALEK: Davros, you have betrayed us.  
DAVROS: It was Dalek Caan.  
RED DALEK: The Vault will be purged. You will all be exterminated.  
(The Red Dalek zaps the control panel.)  
JACK: Like I was saying, feel this!  
(Jack fires an extended pulse from his big gun and the Red Dalek explodes.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, we've lost the magnetron. And there's only one planet left. Oh,
guess which one. But we can use the Tardis.  
(The Doctor runs into the Tardis.)  
NEW DOCTOR: Holding Earth stability. Maintaining atmospheric shell.  
CAAN: The prophecy must complete.  
DAVROS: Don't listen to him.  
CAAN: I have seen the end of everything Dalek, and you must make it happen,
Doctor.  
NEW DOCTOR: He's right. Because with or without a Reality bomb, this Dalek
Empire's big enough to slaughter the cosmos. They've got to be stopped.  
DONNA: Just, just wait for the Doctor.  
NEW DOCTOR: I am the Doctor. Maximising Dalekanium power feeds. Blasting them
back!  
(Daleks start exploding all over the Crucible and all over the Medusa Cascade.
The Doctor runs out of the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: What have you done?  
NEW DOCTOR: Fulfilling the prophecy.

**[Torchwood]**

(The Dalek explodes and the bullets all fall to the floor.)  
GWEN: There goes the Time Lock.

**[Vault]**

DOCTOR: Do you know what you've done? Now get in the Tardis! Everyone! All of
you, inside! Run!

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR [OC]: In! In! In! In!  
NEW DOCTOR: Sarah Jane! Rose! Jackie! Jack! Mickey!

**[Vault]**

(Explosions are starting to wreck the Vault.)  
DOCTOR: Davros? Come with me. I promise I can save you.  
DAVROS: Never forget, Doctor, you did this. I name you. Forever, you are the
Destroyer of the Worlds!  
(A wall of flames leaps up and Davros gurgles his last scream.)  
CAAN: One will still die.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: And off we go.  
(The Tardis dematerialises. The Crucible goes KaBOOM!)  
SARAH: But what about the Earth? It's stuck in the wrong part of space.  
DOCTOR: I'm on it. Torchwood Hub, this is the Doctor. Are you receiving me?

**[Torchwood]**

GWEN: Loud and clear.

**[Tardis]**

GWEN [on scanner]: Is Jack there?  
DOCTOR: Can't get rid of him. Jack, what's her name?  
JACK: Gwen Cooper.  
DOCTOR: Tell me, Gwen Cooper,

**[Torchwood]**

DOCTOR [on screen]: Are you from an old Cardiff family?  
GWEN: Yes, all the way back to the eighteen hundreds.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Ah, thought so. Spatial genetic multiplicity.  
ROSE: Oh, yeah.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's a funny old world. Now, Torchwood, I want you to open up
that

**[Torchwood]**

DOCTOR [on screen]: Rift Manipulator. Send all the power to me.

**[Torchwood]**

IANTO [on scanner]: Doing it now, sir.  
GWEN: What's that for?  
DOCTOR: It's a tow rope. Now then. Sarah, what was your son's name?  
SARAH: Luke. He's called Luke. And the computer's called Mister Smith.  
DOCTOR: Calling Luke and Mister Smith.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

DOCTOR [OC]: This is the Doctor. Come on, Luke. Shake a leg.  
LUKE: Is Mum there?

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Oh, she's fine and dandy.  
SARAH: Yes! Yes!  
DOCTOR: Now, Mister Smith, I want you to harness the Rift power and loop it
around the Tardis. You got that?  
MR SMITH [OC]: I regret I will need remote access to Tardis base code
numerals.  
DOCTOR: Oh, blimey, that's going to take a while.  
SARAH: No, no, no. Let me. K9, out you come!

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

(K9 beams in beside Luke.)  
K9: Affirmative, Mistress.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh! Oh ho! Oh, good dog!

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: K9, give Mister Smith the base code.

**[Sarah Jane's home]**

K9: Master. Tardis base code now being transferred.

**[Tardis]**

K9 [OC]: The process is simple.  
DOCTOR: Now then, you lot. Sarah, hold that down. Mickey, you hold that.
Because you know why this Tardis always is always rattling about the place?
Rose? That, there. It's designed to have six pilots, and I have to do it
single handed. Martha, keep that level. But not any more. Jack, there you go.
Steady that. Now we can fly this thing. No, Jackie. No, no. Not you. Don't
touch anything. Just stand back. Like it's meant to be flown. We've got the
Torchwood Rift looped around the Tardis by Mister Smith, and we're going to
fly Planet Earth back home. Right then. Off we go.  
(The Tardis takes the strain on the tow rope, then pulls Earth out of the
Cascade. Everyone on Earth hangs on for the ride. Donna walks around the
console, supervising the flight.)  
DONNA: That's really good, Jack. I think you're the best.  
(The Tardis drops the Earth off by the Moon, and everyone celebrates.)  
JACKIE: Good job!  
(Donna pulls Jack off Sarah and hugs him herself. On Earth, the news tickers
report the obvious, and fireworks celebrations happen without any set up or
planning whatsoever.)

**[Park]**

(Church bells are ringing a celebratory change.)  
SARAH: You know, you act like such a lonely man. But look at you. You've got
the biggest family on Earth.  
(Sarah and the Doctor hug.)  
SARAH: Oh! Got to go. He's only fourteen. It's a long story. And thank you!

**[Tardis]**

(Donna is phoning home.)  
DONNA: Yeah, I'm fine. Are you all right?  
MICKEY: I'm going to miss you more than anyone.  
JACKIE: What do you mean? The Doctor's going to take us home, isn't he?  
MICKEY: Well, that's the point.

**[Park]**

(The Doctor unmends Jack's teleport bracelet.)  
DOCTOR: I told you, no teleport. And, Martha, get rid of that Osterhagen
thing, eh? Save the world one more time.  
MARTHA: Consider it done.  
(They both salute the Doctor, and he returns it. Jack and Martha walk away.)  
JACK: You know, I'm not sure about UNIT these days. Maybe there's something
else you could be doing?  
(Mickey comes out of the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: Oi, where are you going?  
MICKEY: Well, I'm not stupid. I can work out what happens next. And hey, I had
a good time in that parallel world, but my gran passed away. Nice and
peaceful. She spent her last years living in a mansion. There's nothing there
for me now, certainly not Rose.  
DOCTOR: What will you do?  
MICKEY: Anything. Brand new life. Just you watch. See you, boss. Hey, you two!  
(Mickey catches up with Jack and Martha.)  
JACK: Oh. Thought I'd got rid of you.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Just time for one last trip. D�rlig Ulv Stranden. Better known as

**[D�rlig Ulv Stranden]**

(The Tardis materialises on the beach of Bad Wolf Bay. The New Doctor and
Jackie are first out.)  
JACKIE: Oh, fat lot of good this is. Back of beyond. Bloody Norway? I'm going
to have to phone your father. He's on the nursery run. I was pregnant, do you
remember? Had a baby boy.  
NEW DOCTOR: Oh, brilliant. What did you call him?  
JACKIE: Doctor.  
NEW DOCTOR: Really?  
JACKIE: No, you plum. He's called Tony.  
ROSE: Hold on, this is the parallel universe, right?  
DOCTOR: You're back home.  
DONNA: And the walls of the world are closing again, now that the Reality Bomb
never happened. It's dimensional retroclosure. See, I really get that stuff
now.  
ROSE: No, but I spent all that time trying to find you. I'm not going back
now.  
DOCTOR: But you've got to. Because we saved the universe, but at a cost. And
the cost is him. He destroyed the Daleks. He committed genocide. He's too
dangerous to be left on his own.  
NEW DOCTOR: You made me.  
DOCTOR: Exactly. You were born in battle, full of blood and anger and revenge.
Remind you of someone? That's me, when we first met. And you made me better.
Now you can do the same for him.  
ROSE: But he's not you.  
DOCTOR: He needs you. That's very me.  
DONNA: But it's better than that, though. Don't you see what he's trying to
give you? Tell her. Go on.  
NEW DOCTOR: I look like him and I think like him. Same memories, same
thoughts, same everything. Except I've only got one heart.  
ROSE: Which means?  
NEW DOCTOR: I'm part human. Specifically, the aging part. I'll grow old and
never regenerate. I've only got one life, Rose Tyler. I could spend it with
you, if you want.  
ROSE: You'll grow old at the same time as me?  
NEW DOCTOR: Together.  
(The Tardis time motor revs.)  
DOCTOR: We've got to go. This reality is sealing itself off for ever.  
ROSE: But, it's still not right, because the Doctor's still you.  
DOCTOR: And I'm him.  
ROSE: All right. Both of you, answer me this. When I last stood on this beach,
on the worst day of my life, what was the last thing you said to me? Go on,
say it.  
DOCTOR: I said, Rose Tyler.  
ROSE: Yeah, and how was that sentence going to end?  
DOCTOR: Does it need saying?  
ROSE: And you, Doctor? What was the end of that sentence?  
(The new Doctor whispers the three little words in Rose's ear, and she kisses
him. The Doctor and Donna take the opportunity to get into the Tardis. It
dematerialises.)

**[Tardis]**

DONNA: I thought we could try the planet Felspoon. Just because. What a good
name, Felspoon. Apparently, it's got mountains that sway in the breeze.
Mountains that move. Can you imagine?  
DOCTOR: And how do you know that?  
DONNA: Because it's in your head. And if it's in your head, it's in mine.  
DOCTOR: And how does that feel?  
DONNA: Brilliant! Fantastic! Molto bene! Great big universe, packed into my
brain. You know you could fix that chameleon circuit if you just tried
hotbinding the fragment links and superseding the binary, binary, binary,
binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary,
binary, binary. (gasp) I'm fine. Nah, never mind Felspoon. You know who I'd
like to meet? Charlie Chaplin. I bet he's great, Charlie Chaplin. Shall we do
that? Shall we go and see Charlie Chaplin? Shall we? Charlie Chaplin? Charlie
Chester. Charlie Brown. No, he's fiction. Friction, fiction, fixing, mixing,
Rickston, Brixton.  
(This time it hurts.)  
DONNA: Oh, my God.  
DOCTOR: Do you know what's happening?  
DONNA: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: There's never been a human Time Lord metacrisis before now. And you
know why.  
DONNA: Because there can't be. I want to stay.  
DOCTOR: Look at me. Donna, look at me.  
DONNA: I was going to be with you forever.  
DOCTOR: I know.  
DONNA: The rest of my life, travelling in the Tardis. The Doctor Donna. No. Oh
my god. I can't go back. Don't make me go back. Doctor, please, please don't
make me go back.  
DOCTOR: Donna. Oh, Donna Noble. I am so sorry. But we had the best of times.  
DONNA: No.  
DOCTOR: The best. Goodbye.  
DONNA: No, no, no. Please. Please. No. No.  
(The Doctor mind melds with Donna and takes her memories away.)  
DONNA: No!  
(Donna passes out.)

**[Nobles' home]**

(There is a knocking at the door.)  
WILF: That must be her. Donna?  
(The Tardis is parked across the road. The Doctor is kneeling by the door,
holding the unconscious Donna.)  
DOCTOR: Help me.  
WILF: Donna? Donna?  
(They lay Donna on her bed, then go downstairs. A thunderstorm rolls
overhead.)

**[Sitting room]**

DOCTOR: She took my mind into her own head. But that's a Time Lord
consciousness. All that knowledge, it was killing her.  
WILF: But she'll get better now?  
DOCTOR: I had to wipe her mind completely. Every trace of me, or the Tardis,
anything we did together, anywhere we went, had to go.  
WILF: All those wonderful things she did.  
DOCTOR: I know. But that version of Donna is dead. Because if she remembers,
just for a second, she'll burn up. You can never tell her. You can't mention
me or any of it for the rest of her life.  
SYLVIA: But the whole world's talking about it. We travelled across space.  
DOCTOR: It'll just be a story. One of those Donna Noble stories, where she
missed it all again.  
WILF: But she was better with you.  
SYLVIA: Don't say that.  
WILF: No, she was.  
DOCTOR: I just want you to know there are worlds out there, safe in the sky
because of her. That there are people living in the light, and singing songs
of Donna Noble, a thousand million light years away. They will never forget
her, while she can never remember. And for one moment, one shining moment, she
was the most important woman in the whole wide universe.  
SYLVIA: She still is. She's my daughter.  
DOCTOR: Then maybe you should tell her that once in a while.  
DONNA: I was asleep on my bed in my clothes, like a flipping kid! What do you
let me do that for? Don't mind me. Donna.  
(Donna checks her mobile.)  
DOCTOR: John Smith.  
SYLVIA: Mister Smith was just leaving.  
DONNA: My phone's gone mad. Thirty two texts. Veena's gone barmy. She's saying
planets in the sky. What have I missed now? Nice to meet you.  
(Donna leaves the room.)  
SYLVIA: As I said, I think you should go.

**[Kitchen]**

(Donna is on the phone.)  
DONNA: How thick do you think I am? Planets. Tell you what that was, dumbo.
That's those two for one lagers you gets down the offy because you fancy that
little man in there with the goatee. Ha ha! Yes, you do. I've seen you.  
DOCTOR: Donna? I was just going.  
DONNA: Yeah, see you. I tell you what though, you're wasting your time with
that one, because Susie Mair, she went on that dating site, and she saw him.
No, no, no, no. Listen, listen, this is important. Susie Mair wouldn't lie.
Not unless it was about calories. Ha ha ha!

**[Outside the Nobles' home]**

(It is pouring with rain.)  
DOCTOR: Ah. You'll have quite a bit of this. Atmospheric disturbance. Still,
it'll pass. Everything does. Bye then, Wilfred.  
WILF: Oh, Doctor? What about you now? Who've you got? I mean, all those
friends of yours.  
DOCTOR: They've all got someone else. Still, that's fine. I'm fine.  
WILF: I'll watch out for you, sir.  
DOCTOR: You can't ever tell her.  
WILF: No, no, no. But every night, Doctor, when it gets dark, and the stars
come out, I'll look up on her behalf. I'll look up at the sky, and think of
you.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
(Soaked to the skin, the Doctor squelches to the Tardis. Wilf salutes as it
dematerialises.)
