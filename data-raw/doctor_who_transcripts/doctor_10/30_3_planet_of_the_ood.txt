**Planet of the Ood**  
  
Original Airdate: 19 Apr, 2008  

**[Office]**

(An advertisement is running on a big screen that takes up the entire wall
opposite the desk. It features the Ood, those creatures with tentacles for
mouths from Impossible Planet, who speak through a globe they hold in their
hand.)  
NARRATOR [OC]: The Ood. They came from distant world. They voyaged across the
stars, all with one purpose.  
OOD: Do you take milk and sugar?  
NARRATOR [OC]: To serve.  
BARTLE: That's good. That's excellent. I like it, sir. Buy one now. Direct.
Straight to the point.  
(He is speaking into his wrist-comm.)  
HALPEN [OC]: We play that across the Tri-galactic for two weeks, then
introduce this.  
NARRATOR [OC]: Now only fifty credits.  
BARTLE: Fifty? We're reducing the price to fifty credits?  
HALPEN [OC]: Sales are down. We've got to reposition ourselves. So get going.  
(Communication ends.)  
BARTLE: Idiot. Bleeding us dry. You, there. Get me last month's military
export figures. The army always need more grunts.  
OOD: Yes, sir.  
(A woman's voice comes over the intercom. She has a slight Indian accent.)  
SOLANA [OC]: Mister Bartle, you asked me to call you?  
BARTLE: Solana, when those buyers arrive we're going to pitch like never
before. I want those Ood flying out of here.  
(The Ood hands him a folder.)  
BARTLE: That. I said military figures. That's the domestic files. Get me the
military.  
(The Ood slams the file on the desk. Its eyes are glowing red.)  
OOD: The file is irrelevant, sir.  
BARTLE: Oh? And why's that?  
(The Ood zaps him with its globe.)  
OOD: Have a nice day.

**[Tardis]**

(The Tardis is rocking back and forth in flight. The Doctor stops it.)  
DOCTOR: Set the controls to random. Mystery tour. Outside that door could be
any planet, anywhere, anywhen in the whole wide u. Are you all right?  
DONNA: Terrified. I mean, history's one thing but an alien planet?  
DOCTOR: I could always take you home.  
DONNA: Yeah, don't laugh at me.  
DOCTOR: I know what it's like. Everything you're feeling right now. The fear,
the joy, the wonder? I get that.  
DONNA: Seriously? After all this time?  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Why do you think I keep going?  
DONNA: Oh. All right then, you and me both. This is barmy. I was born in
Chiswick. I've only ever had package holidays. Now I'm here. This is so. I
mean it's. I don't know, it's all sort of. I don't even know what the word is.

**[Planet surface]**

(Donna goes outside.)  
DONNA: Oh, I've got the word. Freezing.  
DOCTOR: Snow! Oh, real snow. Proper snow at last. That's more like it. Lovely.
What do you think?  
DONNA: Bit cold.  
DOCTOR: Look at that view.  
(Massive icicles hang from bridges of rock over vast ravines.)  
DONNA: Yep. Beautiful, cold view.  
DOCTOR: Millions of planets, millions of galaxies, and we're on this one.
Molto bene. Bellissimo, says Donna, born in Chiswick. All you've got is a life
of work and sleep, and telly and rent and tax and takeaway dinners, all
birthdays and Christmases and two weeks holiday a year, and then you end up
here. Donna Noble, citizen of the Earth, standing on a different planet. How
about that Donna?  
(Donna has disappeared.)  
DOCTOR: Donna?  
(Donna comes out of the Tardis in a big fur coat with a hood.)  
DONNA: Sorry, you were saying?  
DOCTOR: Better?  
DONNA: Lovely, thanks.  
DOCTOR: Comfy?  
DONNA: Yep.  
DOCTOR: Can you hear anything inside that?  
DONNA: Pardon?  
DOCTOR: All right, I was saying, citizen of the Earth  
(A space rocket glides slowly above them.)  
DONNA: Rocket. Blimey, a real proper rocket. Now that's what I call a
spaceship. You've got a box, he's got a Ferrari. Come on, lets go see where
he's going.

**[Factory complex]**

(The rocket has landed in a small area between lots of factory and warehouse
buildings. Its occupants are greeted by a man in a white coat.)  
RYDER: Mister Halpen, sir. Doctor Ryder, new head of Ood Management.  
HALPEN: How many dead? Come on, facts and figures. I haven't flown all this
way to discuss the weather, which by the way is freezing.  
RYDER: Solana has the figures, sir.  
SOLANA: Solana Mercurio, sir. Head of Marketing and Galactic Liaison.  
HALPEN: That's just what I need. A PR woman. I don't want a word of this
getting out, is that understood? Now, get to the point. How many dead?

**[Office]**

SOLANA: In the past financial quarter we've had three deaths in the complex,
all attributed to heart attacks or industrial accidents. But now we've
captured this on tape, the cause would seem the same.  
(We hear Bartle's scream as his Ood kills him.)  
HALPEN: It's using the translator ball as a weapon. How's that work?  
RYDER: Well, no idea. I'm checking the equipment. Nothing so far.  
HALPEN: Can't see its eyes from this angle.  
RYDER: I think we have to assume  
HALPEN: Red eye.  
RYDER: I would think so, sir.  
HALPEN: That Ood. What happened to it?  
RYDER: Oh, ran for the wild, sir, like a dog. One of the guards fired off a
shot. It'll be dead by now.  
SOLANA: Can I ask? What's red eye, sir?  
RYDER: Well, it's some sort of infection. The Ood eyes literally change
colour.  
HALPEN: Drink.  
(An Ood moves to obey.)  
RYDER: I can't find a source. All the bacterial scans register negative.  
SOLANA: Sorry, but according to your own rules, sir, there's no alcohol
allowed on base.  
(The Ood hands Halpen a small glass.)  
HALPEN: It's hair tonic, if you must know. Five years ago I had a full head of
hair. Stress, that's what this is. Stress.

**[Planet surface]**

(A delicate music can be heard as they cross a rock bridge.)  
DOCTOR: Hold on, can you hear that? Donna, take your hood down.  
DONNA: What?  
DOCTOR: That noise is like a song. Over there.  
(An Ood lies on the ground, partly covered in snow.)  
DONNA: What is it?  
DOCTOR: An Ood. He's called an Ood.  
DONNA: But it's face.  
DOCTOR: Donna, don't. Not now. It's a he, not an it. Give me a hand.  
DONNA: Sorry.  
DOCTOR: I don't know where the heart is. I don't know if he's got a heart.
Talk to him, keep him going.  
DONNA: It's all right, we've got you. Er, what's your name?  
DELTA 50: Designated Ood Delta 50.  
(Donna speaks into his translator ball.)  
DONNA: My name's Donna.  
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no. You don't need to.  
DONNA: Sorry. Oh, God. This is the Doctor. Just what you need, a doctor.
Couldn't be better, hey?  
DOCTOR: You've been shot.  
DELTA 50: The circle.  
DONNA: No, don't try to talk.  
DELTA 50: The circle must be broken.  
DOCTOR: Circle? What do you mean? Delta 50, what circle? Delta 50? What
circle?  
(Delta 50 sits up with a roar, and red eyes, then exhales and falls back
dead).  
DONNA: He's gone.  
DOCTOR: Careful.  
DONNA: There you are, sweetheart. We were too late. What do we do, do we bury
him?  
DOCTOR: The snow'll take care of that.  
DONNA: Who was he? What's an Ood?  
DOCTOR: They're servants of humans in the forty second century. Mildly
telepathic. That was the song. It was his mind calling out.  
DONNA: I couldn't hear anything. He sang as he was dying.  
DOCTOR: His eyes turned red.  
DONNA: What's that mean?  
DOCTOR: Trouble. Come on. The Ood are harmless. They're completely benign.
Except, the last time I met them, there was this force, like a stronger mind,
powerful enough to take them over.  
DONNA: What sort of force?  
DOCTOR: Oh, long story.  
DONNA: Long walk.  
DOCTOR: It was the Devil.  
DONNA: If you're going to take the mickey, I'll just put my hood back up.  
DOCTOR: Must be something different this time, though. Something closer to
home. Ah ha! Civilisation.

**[Factory complex]**

SOLANA: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ood Sphere. And isn't it bracing?
Here are your information packs, with vouchers, 3D tickets and a map of the
complex. My name's Solana, Head of Marketing. I'm sure we've all spoken on the
vidfone. Now, if you'd like to follow me.  
(The Doctor and Donna join them.)  
DOCTOR: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Late. Don't mind us. Hello. The guards let us
through.  
SOLANA: And you would be?  
DOCTOR: The Doctor and Donna Noble.  
DONNA: Representing the Noble Corporation PLC Limited, Intergalactic.  
SOLANA: Must have fallen off my list. My apologies. Won't happen again. Now
then, Doctor Noble, Mrs Noble, if you'd like to come with me.  
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. We're not married.  
DONNA: We're so not married.  
DOCTOR: Never.  
DONNA: Never ever.  
SOLANA: Of course. And here are your information packs, vouchers inside. Now
if you'd like to come with me, the Executive Suites are nice and warm.  
(An alarm sounds.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, what's that? That sounds like an alarm.

**[Office]**

HALPEN: For God's sake, we've got the buyers arriving, who sounded the alarm?
Drink.

**[Factory complex]**

SOLANA: Oh, it's just a siren for the end of the work shift. Now then, this
way, quick as you can.

**[Office]**

HALPEN: Mister Kess, what the hell's going on?  
KESS [OC]: Ood on the loose, sir.

**[Factory complex]**

KESS: Looks like we've got another one.

**[Office]**

HALPEN: Red eye?  
KESS [OC]: As red as sin, sir.

**[Factory complex]**

KESS: Don't worry, Mister Halpen, we're on it.  
(The Ood runs behind them.)  
GUARD: Sir!  
KESS: All right, then, lads. Go! Get him!

**[Presentation area]**

(Three Ood are standing on small platforms, whilst others are taking round
trays of drinks.)  
SOLANA: As you can see, the Ood are happy to serve, and we keep them in
facilities of the highest standard. Here at the Double O, that's Ood
Operations, we like to think of the Ood as our trusted friends.

**[Factory complex]**

KESS: He's over there. You two follow me.

**[Presentation area]**

SOLANA: We keep the Ood healthy, safe, and educated.

**[Factory complex]**

KESS: Take him alive.

**[Presentation area]**

SOLANA: We don't just breed the Ood. We make them better. Because at heart,
what is an Ood, but a reflection of us? If your Ood is happy, then you'll be
happy, too.

**[Factory complex]**

(Trapped, the Ood growls.)  
KESS: Mister Halpen? This is a bit more than red eye, sir. This is something
new. It's rabid, sir.

**[Office]**

HALPEN: Take it to Doctor Ryder. Just get it out of sight.  
MAN [OC]: Sales figures needed by 19,00 sir.  
HALPEN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
(Halpen checks his hairline in a mirror.)  
HALPEN: What do you think? Growing back? Just a little bit? Like you'd know.

**[Presentation area]**

SOLANA: I'd now like to point out a new innovation from Ood Operations. We've
introduced a variety package with the Ood translator ball. You can now have
the standard setting. How are you today, Ood?  
OOD 1: I'm perfectly well, thank you.  
SOLANA: Or perhaps after a stressful day, a little something for the
gentlemen. And how are you, Ood?  
OOD 2: (husky female) All the better for seeing you.  
SOLANA: And the comedy classic option. Ood, you dropped something.  
OOD 3: (Homer Simpson) D'oh.  
SOLANA: All that for only five additional credits. The details are in your
brochures. Now, there's plenty more food and drink, so don't hold back.  
(Solana leaves. The Doctor goes to her lectern and uses its computer access to
light up the big screen.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, got it. The Ood Sphere, I've been to this solar system before.
Years ago. Ages. Close to the planet Sense Sphere. Let's widen out. The year
4126. That is the Second Great and Bountiful Human Empire.  
(That would be story 7, season 1, The Sensorites.)  
DONNA: 4126? It's 4126. I'm in 4126.  
DOCTOR: It's good, isn't it?  
DONNA: What's the Earth like now?  
DOCTOR: Bit full. But you see, the Empire stretches out across three galaxies.  
DONNA: It's weird. I mean, it's brilliant, but. Back home, the papers and the
telly, they keep saying we haven't got long to live. Global warming, flooding,
all the bees disappearing.  
DOCTOR: Yeah. That thing about the bees is odd.  
DONNA: But look at us. We're everywhere. Is that good or bad, though? I mean,
are we like explorers? Or more like a virus?  
DOCTOR: Sometimes I wonder.  
DONNA: What are the red dots?  
DOCTOR: Ood distribution centres.  
DONNA: Across three galaxies? Don't the Ood get a say in this?  
(Donna goes to an Ood.)  
DONNA: Er, sorry, but.  
(Donna gently touches his arm and he turns to look at her.)  
DONNA: Hello. Tell me, are you all like this?  
OOD 1: I do not understand, Miss.  
DONNA: Why do you say Miss? Do I look single?  
DOCTOR: Back to the point.  
DONNA: Yeah. What I mean is, are there any free Ood? Are there Ood running
wild somewhere, like wildebeest.  
OOD 1: All Ood are born to serve. Otherwise, we would die.  
DONNA: But you can't have started like that. Before the humans, what were you
like?  
OOD 1: The circle.  
DOCTOR: What do you mean? What circle?  
OOD 1: The circle. The circle is  
SOLANA: Ladies and gentlemen. All Ood to hospitality stations, please.  
DOCTOR: I've had enough of the schmoozing. Do you fancy going off the beaten
track?  
(He holds a map of the complex.)  
SOLANA: Now, if I can introduce you  
DONNA: Rough guide to the Ood Sphere? Works for me.  
DOCTOR: Yeah.

**[Detention room]**

(The snarling Ood is chained to the ceiling.)  
HALPEN: What the hell is wrong with it?  
RYDER: It's obviously stage two of red eye. Whatever that means.  
HALPEN: Ood Sigma, have you seen this before?  
SIGMA: Humanity defines us, sir. We look to you for answers.  
HALPEN: Oh, fat lot of good, all of you. We're exporting hundreds of thousands
of Ood to all the civilised planets. If they turn rabid, you know what it'll
mean.  
RYDER: There's only one thing I haven't checked, sir. Warehouse Fifteen.  
HALPEN: Why should that cause trouble? It's been two centuries now. No change,
not ever. Drink.  
RYDER: I know it's restricted access, but if I'm going to work on this, I
should see it. Just in case.  
HALPEN: Can't stand the place. Still, Warehouse Fifteen then. Come on.  
RYDER: What about this one, sir?  
HALPEN: Well, I'd suggest a post mortem. Which means it's got to be dead
first.  
(Halpen leaves. We hear gunfire.)

**[Factory complex]**

(The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on a gate in the wire mesh fencing.)  
TANNOY: Ood shift eight now commencing. Repeat. Ood shift eight now
commencing.  
(The Doctor and Donna watch the Ood marching through in double file from an
upper catwalk. One at the back falls down.)  
KESS: Get up. I said get up.  
(Kess cracks a whip.)  
DONNA: Servants? They're slaves.  
KESS: Get up! March.  
DOCTOR: Last time I met the Ood, I never thought. I never asked.  
DONNA: That's not like you.  
DOCTOR: I was busy. So busy I couldn't save them. I had to let the Ood die. I
reckon I owe them one.  
DONNA: That looks like the boss.  
DOCTOR: Let's keep out of his way. Come on.  
RYDER: How long since you went inside?  
HALPEN: Must be ten years ago.  
(Halpen enters the code to unlock the door.)  
COMPUTER: Warehouse Fifteen.  
HALPEN: My father brought me here when I was six years old.  
COMPUTER: Security protocol initiated.  
HALPEN: God, the stench of it.  
COMPUTER: Warehouse Fifteen door open.

**[Warehouse 15]**

(Apparently, it still smells. The place is lit with red light, and there is
the sound of electricity zapping around. Halpen and Ryder, Ood Sigma and two
guards stop on a catwalk.)  
RYDER: Incredible.  
HALPEN: Like I said, nothing's changed.  
RYDER: I've read the documents, but it doesn't quite prepare you.  
HALPEN: Is it just me, or does it feel as if it's looking at you?  
RYDER: I think I understand the barrier mechanics well enough. I'll check the
signal.  
HALPEN: I suppose it's home sweet home to you. What do you think?  
SIGMA: I have no opinion, sir.  
HALPEN: Well, say hello to Daddy.  
RYDER: Nothing. The barrier's intact. No abnormal signal. Same as it's been
for two hundred years.  
SOLANA [OC]: Mister Halpen, the two people from the Noble Corporation failed
to pass security checks.

**[Presentation area]**

SOLANA: There's no such company, the Noble Corporation doesn't exist. And on
top of that, they seem to have gone missing, sir.

**[Warehouse 15]**

SOLANA [OC]: The Doctor and Miss Noble.  
HALPEN: Just what I need. Start a search. No alarms, got that? Keep it quiet.
You see? Hair loss. Drink. Tell you what, old friend. Have this one on me.
Cheers.  
(Halpen pours his hair restorer onto whatever they are looking down on.
Something growls.)  
HALPEN: I think we're finished here.  
(Halpen leaves. Ryder bumps into Sigma.)  
RYDER: Sorry.  
(Sigma looks down at whatever it is, then follows.)

**[Factory complex]**

(Donna stops by a door as the Doctor walks on. She puts two fingers into her
mouth and blows.)  
DOCTOR: Where'd you learn to whistle?  
DONNA: West Ham, every Saturday.  
(He unlocks the door.)

**[Ood Cargo]**

(It is full of shipping containers.)  
DOCTOR: Ood export. You see? Lifts up the containers, takes them to the rocket
sheds, ready to be flown out all over the three galaxies.  
DONNA: What, you mean, these containers are full of?  
DOCTOR: What do you think?

**[Shipping container]**

(The Ood are standing silently.)  
DONNA: Oh, it stinks. How many of them do you think there are in each one?  
DOCTOR: Hundred? More?  
DONNA: A great big empire built on slavery.  
DOCTOR: It's not so different from your time.  
DONNA: Oi. I haven't got slaves.  
DOCTOR: Who do you think made your clothes?  
DONNA: Is that why you travel round with a human at your side? It's not so you
can show them the wonders of the universe, it's so you can take cheap shots?  
DOCTOR: Sorry.  
DONNA: Don't, Spaceman. I don't understand, the door is open, why don't you
just run away?  
OOD: For what reason?  
DONNA: You could be free.  
OOD: I do not understand the concept.  
DONNA: What is it with that Persil ball? I mean, they're not born with it, are
they? Why do they have to be all plugged in?  
DOCTOR: Ood, tell me. Does the circle mean anything to you?  
ALL OOD: The circle must be broken.  
DONNA: Oh, that is creepy.  
DOCTOR: But what is it? What is the circle?  
ALL OOD: The circle must be broken.  
DOCTOR: Why?  
ALL OOD: So that we can sing.

**[Ood Cargo]**

(Up on a catwalk.)  
KESS: Mister Halpen? I'm in Ood Cargo, I've found your unwanted guests. Go.  
(Kess sets off an alarm.)

**[Shipping container]**

DOCTOR: Oh, that's us. Come on.

**[Office]**

HALPEN: Cut the alarms. I said, no alarms!

**[Presentation area]**

SOLANA: Nothing to worry about, ladies and gentlemen. It's just a fire drill.
We test the system at this time every day. If you'll excuse me.

**[Ood Cargo]**

(Donna stops running.)  
DONNA: Doctor, there's a door.  
(The door opens and guards enter.)  
GUARD: Don't move!  
(The Doctor is further away.)  
DOCTOR: Where've you gone?  
GUARD: Stay where you are.  
KESS: Keep her in there for now.  
DONNA: Get off me. Get off me!  
(Donna is locked in a container with Ood.)  
DOCTOR: Donna? Where are you?  
KESS: All guards withdraw.  
GUARD [OC]: Sir?  
KESS: I said withdraw. Keep to the perimeter. I've got this one. I've always
wanted to do this.  
(Kess actives the claw that moves the containers, and chases the Doctor with
it.)  
KESS: Container locked.

**[Container]**

DONNA: Can you help me?  
(The Ood have red eyes.)  
DONNA: Oh, no, you don't. What have I done? I'm not one of that lot. I'm on
your side. Stay where you are. That's an order. I said, stay. Doctor? Doctor!

**[Ood Cargo]**

(Kess knocks the Doctor down with the claw, then sends it down towards him.
Suddenly, it stops. Solana takes the key from the controls.)  
SOLANA: You heard the instructions. Mister Halpen wants them alive.

**[Container]**

DONNA: Doctor, get me out!

**[Ood Cargo]**

(Two guards are marching the Doctor away.)  
DONNA [OC]: Doctor, get me out of here.  
DOCTOR: If you don't do what she says, you're really in trouble. Not from me,
from her.  
KESS: Unlock the container.  
(Donna runs out.)  
DONNA: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: There we go, safe and sound.  
DONNA: Never mind about me. What about them?  
(The Ood kill the guard by the container door.)  
KESS: Red alert. Fire!  
(Ood come out of other containers.)  
KESS: Shoot to kill.  
(While the guards fire their guns, the Doctor, Donna and Solana run outside.)

**[Factory complex]**

DONNA: If people back on Earth knew what was going on here.  
SOLANA: Oh, don't be so stupid. Of course they know.  
DONNA: They know how you treat the Ood?  
SOLANA: They don't ask. Same thing.  
DOCTOR: Solana, the Ood aren't born like this. They can't be. A species born
to serve could never evolve in the first place. What does the company do to
make them obey?  
SOLANA: That's nothing to do with me.  
DOCTOR: Oh, what, because you don't ask?  
SOLANA: That's Doctor Ryder's territory.  
DOCTOR: Where's he? What part of the complex? I could help with the red eye.
Now show me.  
SOLANA: There. Beyond the red section.  
DOCTOR: Come with me. You've seen the warehouse. You can't agree with all
this. You know this place better than me. You could help.  
SOLANA: They're over here! Guards! They're over here.  
(The Doctor and Donna run off.)  
GUARD: Male and female suspects escaped. West ridge corridor.  
SOLANA: Mister Halpen, I found the Doctor. He's heading for Ood Conversion.  
HALPEN [OC]: On my way.

**[Office]**

HALPEN: Mister Kess, what's the situation?

**[Detention area]**

KESS: We've contained it, sir. Fenced them in. But the red eye seems to be
permanent this time. It's not fading. Worse than that, sir, there's more of
them going rabid. In my opinion, sir, I think we've lost them. The entire
batch contaminated.

**[Office]**

HALPEN: What's causing it? Why now? What's changed?  
(Halpen strokes his head, and some hair comes away in his fingers.)  
HALPEN: How many Ood in total?

**[Detention area]**

KESS: I'd say about two thousand, sir.  
HALPEN [OC]: We can write them off. That's what insurance is for.

**[Office]**

HALPEN: Drink. We've plenty more on the breeding farms. Let's start again.
Fetch the canisters.

**[Detention area]**

HALPEN [OC]: No survivors.  
KESS: My pleasure, sir. You lot. Canisters.

**[Factory complex]**

DOCTOR: This way.  
(They arrive at a door.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, can you hear it? I didn't need the map. I should have listened.

**[Ood Conversion]**

(The Doctor sonics the door lock.)  
DONNA: Hold on. Does that mean we're locked in?  
DOCTOR: Listen. Listen, listen, listen, listen.  
(The ethereal music.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, my head.  
DONNA: What is it?  
DOCTOR: Can't you hear it? The singing?  
(Groups of Ood are sitting in cages. They turn away from the Doctor and
Donna.)  
DONNA: They look different to the others.  
DOCTOR: That's because they're natural born Ood, unprocessed, before they're
adapted to slavery. Unspoilt. That's their song.  
DONNA: I can't hear it.  
DOCTOR: Do you want to?  
DONNA: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: It's the song of captivity.  
DONNA: Let me hear it.  
DOCTOR: Face me.  
(The Doctor makes a mind meld with Donna.)  
DOCTOR: Open your mind. That's it. Hear it, Donna. Hear the music.  
(The song is sad and beautiful. Donna cries.)  
DONNA: Take it away.  
DOCTOR: Sure?  
DONNA: I can't bear it.  
(The Doctor disconnects her from the telepathic field.)  
DONNA: I'm sorry.  
DOCTOR: It's okay.  
DONNA: But you can still hear it.  
DOCTOR: All the time.

**[Outside Ood Conversion]**

HALPEN: Come on. What's the hold up?  
RYDER: It's the experimentation lab. Maximum security. He's fused the system.  
HALPEN: Don't just stand there, get the bolt cutters. Rip that door off.
Solana, go back to the reps, I don't want any of them wandering off and seeing
this. And get them away from the Ood, just in case. Hurry up!  
SOLANA: Yes, sir.

**[Ood Conversion]**

(The Doctor sonics open the cage.)  
DONNA: They're breaking in.  
DOCTOR: Ah, let them.  
(The Ood cower in the corner.)  
DOCTOR: What are you holding? Show me. Friend. Doctor, Donna. Friend. Let me
see. Look at me. Let me see. That's it. That's it, go on. Go on.  
(The Ood opens his hands. He is holding a small brain.)  
DONNA: Is that?  
DOCTOR: It's a brain. A hind brain. The Ood are born with a secondary brain.
Like the amygdala in humans, it processes memory and emotions. You get rid of
that, you wouldn't be Donna any more. You'd be like an Ood. A processed Ood.  
DONNA: So the company cuts off their brains?  
DOCTOR: And they stitch on the translator.  
DONNA: Like a lobotomy. I spent all that time looking for you, Doctor, because
I thought it was so wonderful out here. I want to go home.  
(Crash!)  
GUARD [OC]: They're with the Ood, sir.  
(The Doctor locks himself and Donna in with the Ood.)  
DOCTOR: What you going to do, then? Arrest me? Lock me up? Throw me in a cage?
Well, you're too late. Ha!

**[Office]**

(The Doctor and Donna are handcuffed to some pipes.)  
HALPEN: Why don't you just come out and say it? FOTO activists.  
DOCTOR: If that's what Friends Of The Ood are trying to prove, then yes.  
HALPEN: The Ood were nothing without us, just animals roaming around on the
ice.  
DOCTOR: That's because you can't hear them.  
HALPEN: They welcomed it. It's not as if they put up a fight.  
DONNA: You idiot. They're born with their brains in their hands. Don't you
see, that makes them peaceful. They've got to be, because a creature like that
would have to trust anyone it meets.  
DOCTOR: Oh, nice one.  
DONNA: Thank you.  
HALPEN: The system's worked for two hundred years. All we've got is a rogue
batch. But the infection is about to be sterilised. Mister Kess. How do we
stand?

**[Detention area]**

KESS: Canisters primed, sir. As soon as the core heats up, the gas is
released. Give it two hundred marks and counting.

**[Office]**

DOCTOR: You're going to gas them?.  
HALPEN: Kill the livestock. The classic foot and mouth solution from the olden
days. Still works.  
(In different places, Ood both unconverted and red eyed form circles and
sing.)

**[Presentation area]**

SOLANA: I'm sorry. If I could ask you one more time, could all the reps please
come through to the Education Suites.  
REP: Why move now? It's a free bar.  
SOLANA: Could I ask all the Ood to withdraw. It's feeding time.  
The Oods put their hands to their heads.)  
REP: Ah, you've upset them. Leave them alone.  
SOLANA: I have to insist. If all the Ood could please leave.  
The Ood's eyes have turned red.)  
SOLANA: Ladies and gentlemen, change of plan. If you could leave by the fire
exits.  
REP: I could sell this. You could offer different colours.  
(An Ood kills him. Panic ensues and more people die.)  
MAN: Get out of here! Get out of here!  
(Solana runs outside.)

**[Factory complex]**

GUARD: They've gone insane, Miss. They've gone mad, all of them.  
SOLANA: Just shoot them. Shoot to kill!  
(Solana runs away as the guards open fire, and is killed by a lone Ood.)

**[Office]**

(An alarm sounds.)  
HALPEN: What the hell?

**[Detention area]**

(The countdown passes 51.)  
KESS: What's going on out there?  
(More Ood enter.)

**[Factory complex]**

TANNOY: Emergency status. Emergency status. All exits sealed. All Ood declared
hostile. Ood distribution centre now  
(KaBOOM! goes something very combustible.)  
RYDER: It's a revolution.  
(Sigma follows Halpen as he goes back inside.)

**[Detention area]**

(The Ood have freed their comrades and locked Kess in a cage. The countdown
reaches 1.)  
KESS: Come back. Let me out of here.  
(The gas is set off.)

**[Office]**

HALPEN: Change of plan.  
RYDER: There are no reports of trouble off-world, sir. It's still contained to
the Ood Sphere.  
HALPEN: Then we've got a public duty to stop it before it spreads.  
DOCTOR: What's happening?  
HALPEN: Everything you wanted, Doctor. No doubt there'll be a full police
investigation once this place has been sterilised, so I can't risk a bullet to
the head. I'll leave you to the mercies of the Ood.  
DOCTOR: But Mister Halpen, there's something else, isn't there? Something we
haven't seen.  
DONNA: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: A creature couldn't survive with a separate forebrain and hind brain,
they'd be at war with themselves. There's got to be something else, a third
element, am I right?  
HALPEN: And again, so clever.  
DOCTOR: But it's got to be connected to the red eye. What is it?  
HALPEN: It won't exist for very much longer. Enjoy your Ood.  
(The Doctor and Donna are left alone.)  
DOCTOR: Come on.

**[Factory complex]**

HALPEN: Doctor Ryder. Warehouse Fifteen.  
RYDER: Well, what about this one?  
HALPEN: No. You've not turned. Faithful to the last. Go. Join your people,
while you still can.  
(Halpen and Sigma bow to each other, then Sigma leaves.)  
HALPEN: Come on.

**[Office]**

DONNA: Well, do something. You're the one with all the tricks. You must have
met Houdini.  
DOCTOR: These are really good handcuffs.  
DONNA: Oh well, I'm glad of that. I mean, at least we've got quality.  
(Three Ood enter.)  
DOCTOR: Doctor, Donna, friends.  
DONNA: The circle must be broken.  
DOCTOR: Doctor, Donna, friends.  
DONNA: The circle must be broken.  
DOCTOR: Doctor, Donna, friends.  
DONNA: The circle must be broken.  
DOCTOR: Friends, friends, friends.  
DONNA: The circle must be broken.  
(They continue to repeat themselves while the unconverted Ood connect with the
others and share their knowledge of the Doctor and Donna.)  
OOD: Doctor. Donna. Friends.  
DOCTOR + DONNA: Yes. That's us. Friends. Oh, yes.

**[Factory complex]**

(An Ood attacks Halpen and Ryder's escort.)  
HALPEN: No, leave him.  
(Elsewhere -)  
DOCTOR: I don't know where it is. I don't know where they've gone.  
DONNA: What are we looking for?  
DOCTOR: It might be underground, like some sort of cave, or a cavern, or  
(Halpen unlocks a door).  
COMPUTER: Warehouse Fifteen door open.  
(The Doctor and Donna are knocked down by an explosion.)  
DOCTOR: All right?  
(As the smoke clears, Sigma is standing behind them.)

**[Warehouse 15]**

HALPEN: It's always been an option. My grandfather drew up this plan. That's
the advantage of a family run business, Doctor Ryder. The personal touch.  
RYDER: But we should evacuate. If we can get to the rocket sheds, we can  
HALPEN: No need. We've got this. Detonation packs. Place them around the
circumference. We're going to blow it up. This thing dies, so do the Ood.  
(They place the devices on the catwalk around the mysterious something we
haven't seen yet. Meanwhile, the Doctor sonics the door controls and they get
in. He looks down on -)  
DOCTOR: The Ood Brain. Now it all makes sense, That's the missing link. The
third element, binding them together. Forebrain, hind brain, and this, the
telepathic centre. It's a shared mind, connecting all the Ood in song.  
HALPEN: Cargo. I can always go into cargo. I've got the rockets, I've got the
sheds. Smaller business. Much more manageable, without livestock.  
RYDER: He's mined the area.  
DONNA: You're going to kill it?  
HALPEN: They found that thing centuries ago beneath the Northern Glacier.  
DOCTOR: Those pylons.  
DONNA: In a circle. The circle must be broken.  
DOCTOR: Damping the telepathic field. Stopping the Ood from connecting for two
hundred years.  
HALPEN: And you, Ood Sigma, you brought them here. I expected better.  
SIGMA: My place is at your side, sir.  
HALPEN: Still subservient. Good Ood.  
DONNA: If that barrier thing's in place, how come the Ood started breaking
out?  
DOCTOR: Maybe it's taken centuries to adapt. The subconscious reaching out?  
RYDER: But the process was too slow. It had to be accelerated. You should
never give me access to the controls, Mister Halpen. I lowered the barrier to
its minimum. Friends Of The Ood, sir. It's taken me ten years to infiltrate
the company, and I succeeded.  
HALPEN: Yes. Yes, you did.  
(Halpen throws Ryder over the catwalk railing and onto the giant brain, which
absorbs him.)  
DONNA: You murdered him.  
HALPEN: Very observant, Ginger. Now, then. Can't say I've ever shot anyone
before. Can't say I'm going to like it. But er, it's not exactly a normal day,
is it? Still.  
SIGMA: Would you like a drink, sir?  
HALPEN: I think hair loss is the least of my problems right now, thanks.  
(Sigma stands in front of the Doctor.)  
SIGMA: Please have a drink, sir.  
HALPEN: If, if you're going to stand in their way, I'll shoot you too.  
SIGMA: Please have a drink, sir.  
HALPEN: Have, have you poisoned me?  
SIGMA: Natural Ood must never kill, sir.  
DOCTOR: What is that stuff?  
SIGMA: Ood graft suspended in a biological compound, sir.  
HALPEN: What the hell does that mean?  
DOCTOR: Oh, dear.  
HALPEN: Tell me!  
DOCTOR: Funny thing, the subconscious. Takes all sorts of shapes. Came out in
the red eye as revenge, came out in the rabid Ood as anger, and then there was
patience. All that intelligence and mercy, focused on Ood Sigma. How's the
hair loss, Mister Halpen?  
(More hair comes away in Halpen's hand.)  
HALPEN: What have you done?  
DOCTOR: Oh, they've been preparing you for a very long time. And now you're
standing next to the Ood Brain, Mister Halpen, can you hear it? Listen.  
HALPEN: What have you? I'm not.  
(Halpen's face goes blank. He drops his gun, reaches for his head and peels
the skin off. Then tentacles come out of his mouth.)  
DONNA: They, they turned him into an Ood?  
DOCTOR: Yep.  
DONNA: He's an Ood.  
DOCTOR: I noticed.  
(Halpen sneezes and a small hind brain flops into his hands.)  
SIGMA: He has become Oodkind, and we will take care of him.  
DONNA: It's weird, being with you. I can't tell what's right and what's wrong
any more.  
DOCTOR: It's better that way. People who know for certain tend to be like
Mister Halpen.  
(Beep beep.)  
DOCTOR: Oh!  
(The Doctor deactivates the explosives.)  
DOCTOR: That's better. And now, Sigma, would you allow me the honour?  
SIGMA: It is yours, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes! Stifled for two hundred years, but not any more. The circle
is broken. The Ood can sing.  
(The current around the Brain is shut off and the song starts up, slow but
happy.)  
DONNA: I can hear it!  
(The fighting stops. The Ood raise their palms to the sky and join in.)

**[Planet surface]**

DOCTOR: The message has gone out. That song resonated across the galaxies.
Everyone heard it. Everyone knows. The rockets are bringing them back. The Ood
are coming home.  
SIGMA: We thank you, Doctor Donna, friends of Oodkind. And what of you now?
Will you stay? There is room in the song for you.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I've, I've sort of got a song of my own, thanks.  
SIGMA: I think your song must end soon.  
DOCTOR: Meaning?  
SIGMA: Every song must end.  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Er, what about you? You still want to go home?  
DONNA: No. Definitely not.  
DOCTOR: Then we'll be off.  
SIGMA: Take this song with you.  
DONNA: We will.  
DOCTOR: Always.  
SIGMA: And know this, Doctor Donna. You will never be forgotten. Our children
will sing of the Doctor Donna, and our children's children, and the wind and
the ice and the snow will carry your names forever.  
(The Doctor and Donna go into the Tardis, and it dematerialises.)
