**Fear Her**  
  
Original Airdate: 24 Jun, 2006  

**[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]**

(The bunting is out for the 2012 Olympics in the brand new Stratford housing
estate, and potholes are being repaired with new tarmac. Life moves on
normally.)  
POSTMAN: Morning, love.  
WOMAN: Morning.  
(The young mother pushes her pram past Tom in goal and his friend Dale kicking
a football on the tiny front lawn while doting Dad washes the car.)  
DALE: Yes!  
WOMAN: Hiya!  
TOM'S DAD: All right?  
(On the lamp post is a missing persons poster - Jane McKillen. The scene is
watched from an upstairs window by a young girl. An old woman wheels her
shopping bag along the pavement nervously. The young girl's mother puts the
rubbish out.)  
TRISH: Maeve? Are you okay?  
MAEVE: No, love, I'm not.  
TRISH: Do you want me to call a doctor?  
MAEVE: Doctor can't help. Can't you, can't you feel it, Trish?  
TRISH: I can't feel anything.  
MAEVE: Boys, get indoors! Get inside! Get them inside!  
TOM'S DAD: What's up with you? They ain't done nothing wrong.  
MAEVE: It's happening again!  
(Trish looks up to her daughter's window then goes back inside number 53.)

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

CHLOE: (sings) Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree. Merry merry king of the
bush is he. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be.  
(Chloe turns from the window and starts drawing on a piece of paper.)

**[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]**

MAEVE: They're not safe.  
TOM'S DAD: They're in the garden.  
MAEVE: That's what it likes. It likes it when they're playing. Get them in,
I'm begging you.

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

CHLOE: Merry merry king of the bush is he. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh,
Kookaburra, gay your life must be.  
(Chloe finishes her picture of Dale, with his Union Flag t-shirt.)

**[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]**

TOM'S DAD: It's all right. I've got my beady eyes on them. Come on.  
MAEVE: But, I  
TOM'S DAD: Come on.  
(Tom kicks the ball into the goal, but Dale isn't there any more.)  
MAEVE: No!  
TOM'S DAD: Tom?  
MAEVE: What are you?  
TOM'S DAD: Where's he gone?

**[House]**

MAEVE [OC]: What do you want with our children??  
(Chloe finishes the picture, and the boy on the paper runs forward, screaming
silently.)

**[Open ground]**

(The Tardis materialises in the Tardis-sized gap between a pair of cargo
containers. For once, she gets the door on the wrong side. The Doctor can't
get out.)  
DOCTOR: Ah.  
(He turns her ninety degrees while a train whizzes along the track between the
open ground and the housing estate.)  
DOCTOR: Ah!  
(Rose checks out a Shane Ward Greatest Hits poster on one of the containers.)  
ROSE: So, near future, yeah?  
DOCTOR: I had a passing fancy. Only it didn't pass, it stopped.

**[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]**

DOCTOR: Thirtieth Olympiad.  
ROSE: No way! Why didn't I think of this? That's great.  
DOCTOR: Only seems like yesterday a few naked Greek blokes were tossing a
discus about, wrestling each other in the sand with crowds stood around
baying. No, wait a minute, that was Club Med. Just in time for the opening doo
dah, ceremony, tonight, I thought you'd like that. Last one they had in London
was dynamite. Wembley, 1948. I loved it so much, I went back and watched it
all over again. Fella carrying the torch. Lovely chap, what was his?  
(Tom's dad is putting up Missing posters on the lampposts.)  
DOCTOR: Mark? John? Mark? Legs like pipe cleaners, but strong as a whippet.  
(John Mark, 1925-1991)  
ROSE: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: And in those days, everybody had a tea party to go to.  
ROSE: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Did you ever have one of those little cakes with the crunchy ball
bearings on top?  
ROSE: You should really look at this.  
DOCTOR: Do you know those things? Nobody else in this entire galaxy's ever
even bothered to make edible ball bearings. Genius.  
(The Doctor goes to Rose, and reads the two posters. The boy's name is Dale
Hicks.)  
DOCTOR: What's taking them, do you think? Snatching children from a thoroughly
ordinary street like this. Why's it so cold? Is someone reducing the
temperature?  
ROSE: It says they all went missing this week. Why would a person do something
like this?  
DOCTOR: What makes you think it's a person?  
(A woman puts out her rubbish and goes straight back inside. There is no one
else about apart from the council roadmenders and their white van.)  
ROSE: Whatever it is, it's got the whole street scared to death. Doctor, what  
(The Doctor has run up the street to investigate the front lawn and its goal.
He holds his hand out over the grass. A man in a Mini drives into the road,
and the engine gives out. One of the road menders comes over to help.)  
KEL: There you go. Fifth today. Not natural, is it?  
DRIVER: I don't know what happened, I had it serviced less than a month ago.  
KEL: Nah, don't even try and explain it, mate. All the cars are doing it. And
do you know what? It's bonkers. Bonkers. Come on then, pal. I'll help you
shift it. Quicker you're on the way, happier you'll be.  
(The two men start pushing the car.)  
KEL: There we go.  
ROSE: Do you want a hand?  
KEL: No, we're all right, love.  
ROSE: You're not. I'm tougher than I look, honest.  
(Rose joins Kel pushing at the back, and the engine suddenly bursts into life.
Kel falls over, the driver gets back in drives off.)  
ROSE: Does this happen a lot?  
DRIVER: Cheers, mate!  
KEL: Been doing it all week.  
ROSE: Since those children started going missing?  
KEL: Yeah, I suppose so.  
(Back at the goal.)  
DOCTOR: Ooo, tickles!  
TOM'S DAD: What's your game?  
DOCTOR: My er. Snakes and Ladders? Quite good at squash. Reasonable. I'm being
facetious, aren't I. There's no call for it.  
KEL: Every car cuts out. The council are going nuts. I mean, they've given
this street the works. Renamed it. I've been tarmacking every pot hole. Look
at that. Beauty, init? Yeah! And all that is because that Olympic Torch comes
right by the end of this Close. Just down there. Everything's got to be
perfect, ain't it? Only it ain't.  
MAEVE: It takes them when they're playing.  
ROSE: What takes them?  
MAEVE: Danny, Jane, Dale. Snatched in the blink of an eye.  
(Tom's dad has the Doctor backing away onto the road.)  
DOCTOR: I'm, I'm a police officer! That's what I am. I've got a badge and a
police car. You don't have to get. I can, I can prove it. Just hold on.  
TOM'S DAD: We've had plenty of coppers poking around here, and you don't look
or sound like any of them.  
DOCTOR: See, look. I've got a colleague. Lewis.  
TOM'S DAD: Well, she looks less like a copper than you do.  
DOCTOR: Training. New recruit. It was either that or hairdressing, so, voila!  
(The Doctor brandishes his psychic paper in front of Tom's dad.)  
TRISH: What are you going to do?  
MAEVE: The police have knocked on every door. No clues, no leads, nothing.  
TOM'S DAD: Look, kids run off sometimes, all right? That's what they do.  
MAEVE: Saw it with me own eyes. Dale Hicks in your garden, playing with your
Tommy, and then pfft! Right in front of me, like he was never there. There's
no need to look any further than this street. It's right here amongst us.  
DOCTOR: Why don't we  
WOMAN: Why don't we start with him? There's been all sorts like him in this
street, day and night.  
KEL: Fixing things up for the Olympics.  
TOM'S DAD: Yeah, and taking an awful long time about it.  
DOCTOR: I'm of the opinion that all we've got to do is just  
KEL: You don't. What you just said, that's slander!  
WOMAN: I don't care what it is.  
DOCTOR: I think we need to just  
KEL: I want an apology off her.  
MAEVE: Stop picking on him.  
KEL: Yeah, stop picking on me.  
MAEVE: And stop pretending to be blind. It's evil!  
WOMAN: I don't believe in evil.  
KEL: Oh no, you just believe in tarmackers with sack loads of kidnapped
kiddies in their van.  
TOM'S DAD: Here, here, here, that's not what she's saying.  
KEL: Would you stop ganging up on me.  
WOMAN: Feeling guilty, are we?  
DOCTOR: Fingers on lips!  
(Everyone joins the Doctor in making the Shush gesture.)  
DOCTOR: In the last six days, three of your children have been stolen.
Snatched out of thin air, right?  
MAEVE: Er, can I? Look around you. This was a safe street till it came. It's
not a person. I'll say it if no one else will. Maybe you're coppers, maybe
you're not. I don't care who you are. Can you please help us?  
(Rose looks up at Chloe in the window. Trish notices and goes back inside.
Later, the Doctor is back at Tom's house, sniffing.)  
ROSE: Want a hanky?  
DOCTOR: Can you smell it? What does it remind you of?  
ROSE: Sort of metal?  
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm.  
ROSE: Oh.

**[Back alley]**

(Going between two lots of back gardens. We call it a jennel in my part of the
world.)  
DOCTOR: Danny Edwards cycled in one end but never came out the other. Whoa,
there it goes again! Look at the hairs on the back of my manly hairy hand.  
ROSE: And there's that smell. It's like a er, a burnt fuse plug or something.  
DOCTOR: There's a residual energy in the spots where the kids vanished.
Whatever it was, it used an awful lot of power to do this.

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

(Chloe watches a ginger cat in her front garden, then settles down to draw
again.)  
TRISH: You have to come down some time, Chloe.  
CHLOE: I'm busy, mum.  
TRISH: Look at it in here. You must've used up half a rainforest.  
(Chloe is drawing the cat on Dale's picture. He is now sitting in the bottom
left corner.)  
TRISH: That's Dale. Why did you draw him so sad?  
CHLOE: I didn't draw him like that. Dale made himself sad, so I'm going to
draw him a friend. That's what he needs. More friends.  
TRISH: Have you seen the TV?  
(Trish clicks on Chloe's laptop, and News24 comes on with its live Countdown
to the Games. Huw Edwards' soft Welsh lilt provides the commentary.)  
TRISH: Look, this'll cheer you up. The Torch is getting close. It'll pass
right by our street. And tonight they'll light the Olympic Flame in the
stadium, and the whole world will be looking at our city. I mean, doesn't that
make you feel part of something? Sweetheart? Chloe?  
CHLOE: I'm busy, mum.  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: Danny Fairweather carries the torch past them on this
wonderful summer's day. Very fitting. We've seen lots of our sporting royalty,
too.  
TRISH: Okay. You're tired, Chloe. I heard you calling out again, last night.  
CHLOE: It's fine.  
TRISH: Nightmares?  
CHLOE: I'm drawing!  
TRISH: Whatever they are, they're just dreams, you do know that? They can't
hurt you.  
CHLOE: I'm busy. Unless you want me to draw you, mum.  
TRISH: If you want to stay cooped up in here, fine. I'll leave you to it.  
(Trish leaves. The cat is finished.)

**[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]**

ROSE: Aren't you a beautiful boy??  
DOCTOR: Thanks! I'm experimenting with back combing. Oh.  
(Rose is talking to the ginger cat.)  
ROSE: I used to have one like you. What?  
DOCTOR: No, I'm not really a cat person. Once you've been threatened by one in
a nun's wimple, it kind of takes the joy out of it.  
(The cat goes inside cardboard box.)  
ROSE: Come here, puss. What do you want to go in there for?  
(There is a distant meow. The box is empty.)  
ROSE: Doctor! Phew.  
(The smell is very strong.)  
DOCTOR: Whoa! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Ion residue. Blimey! That takes some doing.
Just to snatch a living organism out of space-time. This baby is just like,
I'm having some of that. I'm impressed.  
ROSE: So the cat's been transported?  
DOCTOR: It can harness huge reserves of ionic power. We need to find the
source of that power. Find the source and you will find whatever has taken to
stealing children and fluffy animals. See what you can see. Keep them peeled,
Lewis.

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

CHLOE: I've given you friends and you still moan. Moan, moan, moan. You're
lucky. You're all together. You don't know what it is to be alone. If you did,
you'd be thanking me. No! (Under the gaze of Danny's picture, frustrated Chloe
does a big scribble on a piece of paper.)

**[Garages]**

(At the top of the close are the narrow three story houses with the integral
garage next to the front door. Rose hears a noise coming from one of them.)  
ROSE: Is that you, puss cat? Are you trapped?  
(More noises and thumping.)  
ROSE: Not going to open it, not going to open it, not going to open it  
(The door is unlocked. Rose gently opens it and a big ball of scribble knocks
her down. The Doctor comes running.)  
DOCTOR: Stay still!  
(He points his sonic screwdriver, and the ball becomes hand-sized. Rose grabs
it.)  
DOCTOR: Okey dokey?  
ROSE: Yeah, cheers.  
DOCTOR: No probs. I'll give you a fiver if you can tell me what the hell it
is, because I haven't got the foggiest.  
ROSE: Well, I can tell you you've just killed it.  
DOCTOR: It was never living. It's animated by energy. Same energy that's
snatching people. That is so dinky! The go anywhere creature. Fits in your
pocket, makes friends, impresses the boss, breaks the ice at parties.

**[Tardis]**

(The ball is under analysis.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, hi ho, here we go. Let's have a look. Get out of here.  
ROSE: What's it say?  
(The Doctor uses the eraser end of a pencil on the ball, and rubs some of it
out.)  
DOCTOR: It is. It's graphite. Basically the same material as an HB pencil.  
ROSE: I was attacked by a pencil scribble?  
DOCTOR: Scribble creature, brought into being with ionic energy. Whatever
we're dealing with, it can create things as well as take them. But why make a
scribble creature?  
ROSE: Maybe it was a mistake I mean, you scribble over something when you want
to get rid of it, like a, like a drawing. Like a, a child's drawing. You said
it was in the street.  
DOCTOR: Probably.  
ROSE: The girl.  
DOCTOR: Of course! What girl?  
ROSE: Something about her gave me the creeps. Even her own mum looked scared
of her.  
DOCTOR: Are you deducting?  
ROSE: I think I am.  
DOCTOR: Copper's hunch?  
ROSE: Permission to follow it up, Sarge?

**[Front door]**

(The Doctor rings the doorbell, then rattles the letter box. Trish eventually
answers the door.)  
DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor and this is Rose. Can we see your daughter?  
TRISH: No, you can't.  
DOCTOR: Okay. Bye.  
TRISH: Why? Why do you want to see Chloe?  
DOCTOR: Well, there's some interesting stuff going on in this street, and I
just thought. Well, we thought, that she might like to give us a hand.  
ROSE: Sorry to bother you.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, sorry. We'll let you get on with things. On your own. Bye again.  
TRISH: Wait! Can you help her?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I can.

**[Living room]**

(The television is on, of course.)  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: The Torch Bearer is running up the Mall, which I can tell
you is  
TRISH: She stays in her room most of the time. I try talking to her, but it's
like trying to speak to a brick wall. She gives me nothing, just asks to be
left alone.  
ROSE: What about Chloe's dad?  
TRISH: Chloe's dad died a year ago.  
ROSE: I'm sorry.  
TRISH: You wouldn't be if you'd known him.  
DOCTOR: Well, let's go and say hi.  
TRISH: I should check on her first. She might be asleep.  
DOCTOR: Why are you afraid of her, Trish?  
TRISH: I want you to know before you see her that's she's really a great kid.  
DOCTOR: I'm sure she is.  
TRISH: She's never been in trouble at school you should see her report from
last year. A's and B's.  
ROSE: Can I use your loo?  
TRISH: She's in the choir. She's singing in an old folks home. Any mum would
be proud. You know I want you to know these things before you see her, Doctor,
because right now, she's not herself.  
(Rose goes upstairs, and hides in the airing closet as Chloe comes out of her
room and goes downstairs. She goes into Chloe's room and sees the wall covered
in drawings, including Dale and the cat. There is a noise from the wardrobe,
and she knocks over a jar of coloured pencils. When she's picked them up
again, Dale is scowling.)

**[Kitchen]**

(Chloe is getting herself a drink of milk from the fridge.)  
DOCTOR: All right, there? I'm the Doctor.  
CHLOE: I'm Chloe Webber.  
DOCTOR: How're you doing, Chloe Webber?  
CHLOE: I'm busy. I'm making something, aren't I, mum.  
TRISH: And like I said, she's not been sleeping.  
DOCTOR: But you've been drawing, though. I'm rubbish. Stick men about my
limit. Can do this, though.  
(He gives the Vulcan salute.)  
DOCTOR: Can you do that?  
CHLOE: They don't stop moaning.  
TRISH: Chloe.  
CHLOE: I try to help them, but they don't stop moaning.  
DOCTOR: Who don't?  
CHLOE: We can be together.  
TRISH: Sweetheart.  
CHLOE: Don't touch me, mum.

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

(The doors to the wardrobe rattle again. Rose opens them. A wind blows in her
face. She parts the clothes to see a drawing of a bearded, yellow-eyed man.)  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: I'm coming.

**[Kitchen]**

CHLOE: I'm busy, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Come on, Chloe. Don't be a spoil sport. What's the big project? I'm
dying to know. What're you making up there?  
ROSE [OC]: Doctor!

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

(The Doctor gets there first.)  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: I'm coming to hurt you.  
(The Doctor shuts the doors.)  
ROSE: Look at it.  
DOCTOR: No, ta.  
(He goes to look at the other pictures.)  
TRISH: What the hell was that?  
ROSE: A drawing. The face of a man.  
TRISH: What face?  
ROSE: Best not.  
TRISH: What've you been drawing?  
CHLOE: I'm drew him yesterday.  
TRISH: Who?  
CHLOE: Dad.  
TRISH: Your dad? But he's long gone. Chloe, with all the lovely things in the
world, why him?  
CHLOE: I dream about him, staring at me.  
TRISH: I thought we were putting him behind us. What's the matter with you?  
CHLOE: We need to stay together.  
TRISH: Yes, we do.  
CHLOE: No. Not you, us. We need to stay together, and then it'll be all right.  
ROSE: Trish, the drawings. Have you seen what Chloe's drawings can do?  
TRISH: Who gave you permission to come into her room? Get out of my house.  
DOCTOR: Tell us about the drawings, Chloe.  
TRISH: I don't want to hear any more of this.  
ROSE: But that drawing of her dad. I heard a voice. He spoke.  
TRISH: He's dead. And these, they're kid's pictures. Now get out!  
ROSE: Chloe has a power. And I don't know how, but she used it to take Danny
Edwards, Dale Hicks. She's using it to snatch the kids.  
TRISH: Get out.  
ROSE: Have you seen those drawings move?  
TRISH: I haven't seen anything.  
DOCTOR: Yes, you have, out of the corner of your eye.  
TRISH: No.  
DOCTOR: And you dismissed it, because what choice do you have when you see
something you can't possibly explain? You dismiss it, right? And if anyone
mentions it, you get angry, so it's never spoken of, ever again.  
TRISH: She's a child.  
DOCTOR: You're terrified of her. But there's nowhere to turn to, because who's
going to believe the things you see out of the corner of your eye? No one.
Except me.  
TRISH: Who are you?  
DOCTOR: I'm help.

**[Kitchen]**

(The Doctor absentmindedly starts eating marmalade from a jar with his
fingers.)  
ROSE: Ahem.  
(He realises what he is doing and puts it back.)  
ROSE: Those pictures, they're alive. She's drawing people and they end up in
her pictures.  
DOCTOR: Ionic energy. Chloe's harnessing it to steal those kids and place them
in some kid of holding pen made up of ionic power.  
ROSE: And what about the dad from hell in her wardrobe?  
TRISH: How many times do I have to tell you he's dead.  
ROSE: Well, he's got a very loud voice for a dead bloke.  
DOCTOR: If living things can become drawings, then maybe drawings can become
living things. Chloe's real dad is dead, but not the one who visits her in her
nightmares. That dad seems very real. That's the dad she's drawn and he's a
heartbeat away from crashing into this world.  
TRISH: She always got the worst of it when he was alive.  
ROSE: Doctor, how can a twelve year old girl be doing any of this?  
DOCTOR: Let's find out.

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

(Chloe is sitting on her bed. She does the Vulcan salute when the Doctor
enters.)  
DOCTOR: Nice one.  
(He puts his fingers on her temple and she rolls her eyes up. A sort of mind
meld, while we're on the Spock theme. He lays her back on the bed.)  
DOCTOR: There we go.  
TRISH: I can't let him do this  
ROSE: Shush, it's okay. Trust him.  
DOCTOR: Now we can talk.  
CHLOE: I want Chloe. Wake her up. I want Chloe.  
DOCTOR: Who are you?  
CHLOE: I want Chloe Webber.  
TRISH: What've you done to my little girl?  
ROSE: Doctor, what is it?  
DOCTOR: I'm speaking to you, the entity that is using this human child. I
request parley in compliance with the Shadow Proclamation.  
CHLOE: I don't care about shadows or parleys.  
DOCTOR: So what do you care about?  
CHLOE: I want my friends.  
DOCTOR: You're lonely, I know. Identify yourself.  
CHLOE: I am one of many. I travel with my brothers and sisters. We take an
endless journey. A thousand of your lifetimes. But now I am alone. I hate it.
It's not fair, and I hate it.  
DOCTOR: Name yourself!  
CHLOE: Isolus.  
DOCTOR: You're Isolus. Of course.  
CHLOE: Our journey began in the Deep Realms when we were a family.  
(The Isolus is drawing as she speaks.)  
TRISH: What's that?  
DOCTOR: The Isolus Mother, drifting in deep space. See, she jettisons millions
of fledgling spores. Her children. The Isolus are empathic beings of intense
emotions, but when they're cast off from their mother, their empathic link,
their need for each other, is what sustains them. They need to be together.
They cannot be alone.  
CHLOE: Our journey is long.  
DOCTOR: The Isolus children travel, each inside a pod. They ride the heat and
energy of solar tides. It takes thousands and thousands of years for them to
grow up.  
ROSE: Thousands of years just floating through space. Poor things. Don't they
go mad with boredom?  
CHLOE: We play.  
ROSE: You play?  
DOCTOR: While they travel, they play games. They use their ionic power to
literally create make believe worlds in which to play.  
ROSE: In flight entertainment.  
DOCTOR: Helps keep them happy. While they're happy, they can feed off each
others love. Without it, they're lost. Why did you come to Earth?  
CHLOE: We were too close.  
DOCTOR: That's a solar flare from your sun. Would have made a tidal wave of
solar energy that scattered the Isolus pods.  
CHLOE: Only I fell to Earth. My brothers and sisters are left up there, and I
cannot reach them. So alone.  
DOCTOR: Your pod crashed. Where is it?  
(Memory of a tiny white flower-like being flying into Chloe's room and then
into her mouth.)  
CHLOE: My pod was drawn to heat, and I was drawn to Chloe Webber. She was like
me, alone. She needed me, and I her.  
DOCTOR: You empathised with her. You wanted to be with her because she was
alone like you.  
CHLOE: I want my family. It's not fair.  
DOCTOR: I understand. You want to make a family. But you can't stay in this
child. It's wrong. You can't steal any more friends for yourself.  
CHLOE: I am alone.  
(A crash from the wardrobe. A red glow and the door shakes. Chloe is shaking.)  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: I'm coming to hurt you. I'm coming.  
DOCTOR: Trish, how do you calm her?  
TRISH: What?  
DOCTOR: When she has nightmares, what do you do?  
TRISH: I, I  
DOCTOR: What do you do?  
TRISH: I sing to her.  
DOCTOR: Then start singing.  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: Chloe, I'm coming.  
TRISH: Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree. Merry, merry king of the bush is
he  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: Chloe. Chloe. Chloe. Chloe.  
TRISH: Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be. Laugh,
Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be.  
(Chloe falls asleep, and the wardrobe falls silent.)  
TRISH: He came to her because she was lonely. Chloe, I'm sorry.

**[Living room]**

(They are collecting all the pencils they can find.)  
TRISH: Chloe usually got the brunt of his temper when he'd had a drink. The
day he crashed the car, I thought we were free. I thought it was over.  
ROSE: Did you talk to her about it?  
TRISH: I didn't want to.  
ROSE: But maybe that's why Chloe feels so alone. Because she has all these
terrible dreams about her dad, but she can't talk to you about them.  
DOCTOR: Her and the Isolus. Two lonely kids who need each other.  
ROSE: And it won't stop, will it, Doctor? It'll just keep pulling kids in.  
DOCTOR: It's desperate to be loved. It's used to a pretty big family.  
ROSE: How big?  
DOCTOR: Say around four billion?

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

(Chloe is watching the television on her laptop.)  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: The queues started a week ago for those desperate enough to
be inside, and lots of them are expecting a capacity crowd of eighty thousand
for this evening's opening ceremony. I have to say there's been

**[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]**

DOCTOR: We need that pod.  
ROSE: It crashed. Won't it be destroyed?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's been sucking in all the heat it can. Hopefully that should
keep it in a fit state to launch. It must be close. It should have a weak
energy signature that the Tardis can trace. Once we find it, then we can stop
the Isolus.  
(Chloe watches them from her window.)

**[Living room]**

(Trish is on the telephone.)  
TRISH: She's running a temperature. I can't go into that now, Kirsty. Yes,
we've got a doctor.  
(Chloe sneaks out the front door.)  
TRISH: Yeah, he said he can help her.

**[Open ground]**

DOCTOR: We can scan for the same trace that I picked up from the scribble
creature. We'd need to widen the field a bit.  
(Chloe watches the Doctor and Rose go inside the Tardis.)

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor is building a gizmo.)  
ROSE: You knew the Isolus was lonely before it told you. How?  
DOCTOR: I know what it's like to travel a long way on your own. Give me the
styner-magnetic. The thing in your left hand.  
ROSE: Sounds like you're on its side.  
DOCTOR: I sympathise, that's all.  
ROSE: The Isolus has caused a lot of pain for these people.  
DOCTOR: It's a child. That's why it went to Chloe. Two lonely mixed up kids.  
ROSE: Feels to me like a temper tantrum because it can't get its own way.  
DOCTOR: It's scared. Come on, you were a kid once. Binary dot.  
ROSE: Yes, and I know what kids can be like. Right little terrors.  
(Chloe returns to her room and pulls the head off a doll to reveal her secret
stash of pencils.)  
DOCTOR: Gum.  
(Rose spits her chewing gum.)  
ROSE: I've got cousins. Kids can't have it all their own way. That's part of
being a family.  
DOCTOR: What about trying to understand them?  
ROSE: Easy for you to say. You don't have kids.  
DOCTOR: I was a dad once.  
ROSE: What did you say?  
(The Doctor uses Rose's chewing gum to fix a component in place, then closes
the lid on the glass globe containing the gizmo.)  
DOCTOR: I think we're there. Fear, loneliness. They're the big ones, Rose.
Some of the most terrible acts ever committed have been inspired by them.
We're not dealing with something that wants to conquer or destroy. There's a
lot of things you need to get across this universe. Warp drive, wormhole
refractors. You know the thing you need most of all? You need a hand to hold.  
(Rose is holding her hand out, so he takes it.)  
ROSE: No, Look, I'm pointing.  
(The scanner is registering an energy source.)  
DOCTOR: It's the pod! It is in the street. Everything's coming up Doctor.  
(Chloe starts drawing the Tardis.)

**[Open ground]**

DOCTOR: Okay. It's about two inches across. Dull grey, like a gull's egg. Very
light.  
(Chloe draws the Doctor.)  
ROSE: So these pods they travel from sun to sun using heat, yeah? So it's not
all about love and stuff. Doesn't the pod just need heat?  
(There's a crash as the gizmo falls to the ground and breaks.)  
ROSE: Doctor?  
(The Doctor and the Tardis have vanished.)  
ROSE: Doctor!

**[Staircase]**

(Rose hammers on Trish's door. She lets her in and Rose runs upstairs.)  
TRISH: It's okay. I've taken all the pencils off her.

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

(Rose snatches the drawing of the Doctor and the Tardis.)  
CHLOE: Leave me alone. I want to be with Chloe Webber. I love Chloe Webber.  
ROSE: Bring him back, now.  
CHLOE: No.  
ROSE: Don't you realise what you've done? He was the only one who could help
you. Now bring him back!  
CHLOE: Leave me alone! I love Chloe Webber!  
ROSE: I know. I know. Doctor, if you can hear me, I'm going to get you out of
there. I'll find the pod. (to Trish) Don't leave her alone, no matter what.  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: The Torch Bearer getting even closer to the Olympic Stadium
heading down the Strand before turning east along the Embankment.

**[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]**

(Kel is admiring his latest tarmac patch.)  
ROSE: Heat. They travel on heat.  
KEL: Look at this finish. Smooth as a baby's bottom. Not a bump or a lump.  
ROSE: Kel, was there anything in this street in the last few days giving off a
lot of heat?  
KEL: I mean, you can eat your dinner off this. Beautiful. So you tell me why
the other one's got a lump in it when I gave it the same love and
craftsmanship as I did this one.  
ROSE: Well, when you've worked it out, put it in a big book about tarmacking,
but before you do that, think back six days.  
KEL: Six days. When I was laying this the first time round.  
ROSE: What?  
KEL: Well, that's when I filled in this pothole for the first time.  
ROSE: Six days ago.  
KEL: Yeah.  
ROSE: Hot fresh tar.  
KEL: Blended to a secret council recipe.  
(Rose runs to his van.)  
KEL: I don't keep it in the van! Hey, that's a council van. Out.  
(Rose grabs a pick axe from the back of the van.)  
KEL: Whoa, wait, wait, wait. You just removed a council axe from a council
van. Put it back. No, don't, wait. Put the axe back in the van. That's my van.
Give me the axe. No! Wait! No!  
(Rose starts digging up the pothole.)  
KEL: No! You, stop! You just took a council axe from a council van and now
you're digging up a council road! I'm reporting you to the council!  
(Rose finds the tiny spaceship.)  
ROSE: It went for the hottest thing in the street. Your tar.  
KEL: What is it?  
ROSE: It's a spaceship. Not a council spaceship, I'm afraid.

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

HUW EDWARDS [OC]: We're live on News 24. The opening ceremony of the London
Olympics of 2012 is well underway, and people from all over the world are
streaming into the stadium right now. They all have their dreams. They've all
put in years of hard work  
(Chloe bars her bedroom door with a chair. She grabs a pencil from under the
mattress, and begins to draw the Stadium and its occupants.)

**[Living room]**

ROSE: I've found it! I don't know what to do with it, but maybe the Isolus
will just hop on board. Hang on, I told you not to leave her.  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: My God! Er, what's going on here?  
(The stadium crowd have vanished. Kel enters.)  
KEL: I don't care if you've got Snow White and the Seven Dwarves buried under
there, you don't go digging up  
ROSE: Shut up and look!  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: The crowd has vanished! Er, they're gone. Everyone has gone.
Thousands of people have just gone. Right in front of my eyes. It's
impossible. Bob, can we join you in the box? Bob? Not you too, Bob?  
ROSE: The stadium won't be enough. The Isolus has four billion brothers and
sisters.

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

HUW EDWARDS [OC]: Over eighty thousand spectators and thirteen thousand
athletes.  
CHLOE: Not enough.  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: They're gone. All of those people. It's a terrible, terrible
turn of events.  
(Chloe opens an atlas and prepares to draw the Earth.)  
CHLOE: We won't be alone, Chloe Webber. We'll have all of them. And then we'll
never feel alone, ever again.  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: Since the battle of Torchwood.  
ROSE [OC]: Chloe? Chloe, it's Rose! Open the door!  
(Chloe rips down some pictures and starts drawing on the wall.)

**[Outside Chloe's bedroom]**

ROSE: We found your ship. We can send you home.  
TRISH: Chloe?  
ROSE: Open up! Right, stand back.

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: I'm coming to hurt you. (Rose uses the pickaxe to break down
the bedroom door.)  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: I'm coming, coming to hurt you.  
(Rose gets a hand through to push the chair away and come in.)  
ROSE: Chloe!  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: I'm coming to hurt you. I'm coming.  
ROSE: I've got to stop her.  
CHLOE: If you stop Chloe Webber, I will let him out. We will let him out
together. I cannot be alone. It's not fair.  
ROSE: Look, I've got your pod.  
CHLOE: The pod is dead.  
ROSE: It only needs heat.  
CHLOE: It needs more than heat.  
ROSE: What, then?  
KEL: I'm not being funny or nothing, but that picture just moved. And that
one!  
(The Doctor is pointing to an Olympic torch.)  
ROSE: She didn't draw that, he did. But it needs more than heat, Doctor.  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: Is still on its way. I suppose it's much more than a torch
now, it's a beacon. It's a beacon of hope and fortitude and courage. And it's
a beacon of love.  
ROSE: Love.  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: So let's have a look from the helicopter. There we go, the
torch bearer running  
ROSE: I know how to charge up the pod.  
HUW EDWARDS: Past Dame Kelly Holmes Close.

**[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]**

(Rose pushes her way through the crowd at the end of the close.)  
POLICEMAN: Sorry, you'll have to watch from here.  
ROSE: No, I've got to get closer.  
POLICEMAN: No way.  
ROSE: I can stop this from happening!

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

(Chloe has coloured in Europe and Africa, and is starting on the Atlantic.)  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: Chloe.  
TRISH: Chloe.  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: I'm coming to hurt you.  
TRISH: She's my baby! You're not going to hurt her again!  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: I'm coming.

**[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]**

(The pod is chittering.)  
ROSE: You felt it, didn't you? Feel the love.  
(Rose throws the pod into the air, and it flies into the flame of the Torch.
The Torch Bearer staggers briefly then carries on.)  
ROSE: Yes!

**[Chloe's bedroom]**

CHLOE: I can go home. Goodbye, Chloe Webber. I love you.  
(The Isolus leaves Chloe and breaks a windowpane on its way out.)  
CHLOE: Mum?  
TRISH: I'm here.  
CHLOE: Mummy!

**[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]**

KEL: You did it! What was it you did?  
(Back down the Close, the missing children reappear and run to their parents.)  
DALE: Mummy!  
JANE'S MOTHER: Oh, Jane!  
ROSE: Doctor.  
MAEVE: I don't know who you are, or what you did, but thank you, darling! And
thank that man for me too.  
ROSE: Where is he? He should be here. All the drawings have come to life. That
means all of them. Oh, no.  
(There is a red glow in Chloe's bedroom.)

**[Front door]**

(Chloe and Trish are walking down the stairs when the front door slams shut,
then the other doors, too.)  
ROSE: Trish, get out!  
TRISH: I can't! The door's stuck!  
ROSE: Is the Doctor in there?  
TRISH: I don't think so.  
CHLOE: Mummy.  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: Chloe, I'm coming to hurt you.  
CHLOE: Please, dad. No more.  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: Chloe  
ROSE: Chloe, listen to me. It isn't real like the others. It's just energy
left over by the Isolus, but you can get rid of it.  
TRISH: Help us!  
ROSE: Oh, it's because you're so scared that he's real. But you can get shot
of him, Chloe.  
CHLOE: Mummy!  
ROSE: You can do it, Chloe!  
CHLOE: I can't!  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: Chloe, I'm coming.  
CHLOE: I can't! I can't!  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: I'm coming.  
CHLOE: I can't.  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: I'm coming.  
CHLOE: Mummy.  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: Chloe.  
TRISH: I'm with you, Chloe. You're not alone. You'll never be alone again.  
ROSE: Sing again! Chloe, sing!  
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: Chloe. Chloe. Chloe. Chloe. Chloe, I'm coming to hurt you.
Chloe!  
CHLOE + TRISH: Merry merry king of the bush is he. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh,
Kookaburra, gay your life must be. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay
your life must be.  
(The red glow fades and retreats.)  
CHLOE + TRISH: Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree. Merry merry king of the
bush is he. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be.

**[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]**

(Kel walks up to Rose, sitting by Trish's front door.)  
KEL: Maybe he's gone somewhere.  
ROSE: Who's going to hold his hand now?

**[Living room]**

HUW EDWARDS [OC]: Just look at this! Utterly incredibly scenes at the Olympic
stadium. Eighty thousand athletes and spectators. They disappeared, they've
come back!  
(Rose and Kel enter.)  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: They've returned. They've reappeared. It's quite incredible.
Bob, this will certainly  
ROSE: Eighty thousand people, so where's the Doctor? I need him.  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: But hang on, the Torch Bearer seems to be in a bit of
trouble. We did see a flash of lightning earlier that seemed to strike him.
Maybe he's injured. He's definitely in trouble.  
(The torch bearer collapses.)  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: Does this mean that the Olympic dream is dead?  
(A man in a brown suit and plimsolls picks up the torch.)  
ROSE: Doctor.  
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: There's a mystery man. He's picked up the flame. We've no
idea who he is. He's carrying the flame. Yes, he's carrying the flame and no
one wants to stop him. It's more than a flame now, Bob. It's more than heat
and light. It's hope, and it's courage, and it's love.

**[Olympic stadium]**

(The spotlight follows the Doctor as he runs up the red carpet to the lower
cauldron. He whoops with joy then lights the gas.)  
DOCTOR: Go on. Join your brothers and sisters. They'll be waiting.  
(The flame runs up to the main cauldron and ignites the proper Olympic flame.
The Isolus pod zooms up into the night sky.)

**[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]**

ROSE: Cake?  
(She holds out a fairy cake with silver sugar ball decorations on.)  
DOCTOR: Top banana. Mmm. I can't stress this enough. Ball bearings you can
eat, masterpiece!  
ROSE: I thought I'd lost you.  
DOCTOR: Nah. Not on a night like this. This is a night for lost things being
found. Come on.  
ROSE: What now?  
DOCTOR: I want to go to the Games. It's what we came for.  
ROSE: Go on, give us a clue. Which events do we do well in?  
DOCTOR: Well, I will tell you this. Papua New Guinea surprises everyone in the
shot put.  
ROSE: Really? You're joking, aren't you? Doctor, are you serious or are you
joking?  
DOCTOR: Wait and see.  
(The obligatory fireworks display starts.)  
ROSE: You know what? They keep on trying to split us up, but they never ever
will.  
DOCTOR: Never say never ever.  
ROSE: Nah, we'll always be okay, you and me. Don't you reckon, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: There's something in the air. Something coming.  
ROSE: What?  
DOCTOR: A storm's approaching.
