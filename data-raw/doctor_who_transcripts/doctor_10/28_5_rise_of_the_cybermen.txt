**Rise of the Cybermen**  
  
Original Airdate: 13 May, 2006  

**[Laboratory]**

(A man in a lab coat presses a button, and backlights a humanoid figure.)  
KENDRICK: The prototype has passed every test, sir. It's working.  
LUMIC: I hardly think working is the correct word.  
(Lumic moves his electric wheelchair forward.)  
LUMIC: That would apply only to machines.  
KENDRICK: I'm sorry. I should say, it's alive.  
LUMIC: Can it hear me?  
KENDRICK: It might still be in shock. Bear in mind the brain has been welded
to the exoskeleton.  
LUMIC: Skin of metal and a body that will never age or die. I envy it. Do you
know me? Answer. Do you know me?  
CYBERMAN: You are John Lumic.  
LUMIC: My child. Mark this day, Doctor Kendrick. We are blessed.  
KENDRICK: Well, it's not quite over yet, sir. We need Geneva's approval.
Technically, this is a new form of life, and that contravenes the Bio-
convention. They need to ratify this.  
LUMIC: And they will refuse me.  
KENDRICK: Nonetheless, we need to tell them.  
LUMIC: And if I don't?  
KENDRICK: Well then, I'm sorry, sir, but it's my duty. I shall have to inform
them.  
LUMIC: And how will you do that from beyond the grave?  
KENDRICK: I don't quite understand.  
LUMIC: Kill him.  
(The Cyberman puts a gauntlet on Kendrick's shoulder and sends electricity
through his body. Lumic turns away, smiling, and uses the intercom on his
wheelchair.)  
LUMIC: Captain?  
CAPTAIN [OC]: Yes, sir.  
LUMIC: Inform all staff. We have a new destination. Set sail for Great
Britain!

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: And that weird munchkin lady with the big eyes? Do you remember? the
way she looked at you! And then she opens her mouth and fire comes out!  
ROSE: I thought I was going to get frazzled!  
DOCTOR: Yeah. One minute she's standing there, and the next minute roar!  
MICKEY: Yeah. where was that, then? What happened?  
DOCTOR: Oh, it was on this er, this er planet thing. Asteroid. It's a long
story, you had to be there. Er, what're you doing that for?  
MICKEY: Because you told me to.  
DOCTOR: When was that?  
MICKEY: About half an hour ago  
DOCTOR: Er, you can let go now.  
MICKEY: Well, how long's it been since I could've stopped?  
DOCTOR: Ten minutes? Twenty? Twenty nine?  
MICKEY: You just forgot me!  
DOCTOR: No, no, no. I was just, I was, I was calibrating. I was just. No, I
know exactly what I'm doing.  
(And the time rotor blows up.)  
ROSE: What's happened?  
DOCTOR: The time vortex is gone. That's impossible. It's just gone. Brace
yourself! We're going to crash!  
(The Tardis comes to a sudden stop, and gas masks drop from the ceiling. The
power is off.)  
DOCTOR: Everyone all right? Rose? Mickey?  
MICKEY: I'm fine. I'm okay. Sorry. Yeah.  
DOCTOR: She's dead. The Tardis is dead.  
ROSE: You can fix it?  
DOCTOR: There's nothing to fix. She's perished. The last Tardis in the
universe. Extinct.  
ROSE: We can get help, yeah?  
DOCTOR: Where from?  
ROSE: Well, we've landed. We've got to be somewhere.  
DOCTOR: We fell out of the vortex, through the void, into nothingness. We're
in some sort of no place. The silent realm. The lost dimension.  
(Mickey opens the door.)  
MICKEY: Otherwise known as London.

**[Lambeth Pier]**

MICKEY: London, England, Earth. Hold on.  
(Mickey picks up a discarded newspaper.)  
MICKEY: First of February this year not exactly far flung, is it?  
DOCTOR: So this is London.  
MICKEY: Yep.  
DOCTOR: Your city.  
MICKEY: That's the one.  
DOCTOR: Just as we left it.  
MICKEY: Bang on.  
DOCTOR: And that includes the Zeppelins?  
MICKEY: What the hell?  
(Massive airships pass overhead.)  
ROSE: That's beautiful.  
MICKEY: Okay, so it's London with a big international Zeppelin festival.  
DOCTOR: This is not your world.  
MICKEY: But if the date's the same, it's parallel, right? Am I right? Like a
parallel Earth where they've got Zeppelins. Am I right? I'm right, aren't I?  
DOCTOR: Must be.  
ROSE: So, a parallel world where  
MICKEY: Oh, come on. You've seen it on films. Like an alternative to our world
where everything's the same but a little bit different, like, I don't know,
traffic lights are blue, Tony Blair never got elected.  
ROSE: And he's still alive.  
(Rose is staring at an advert for Vitex Lite, cherry flavour, starring Pete
Tyler.)  
ROSE: A parallel world and my dad's still alive.  
DOCTOR: Don't look at it, Rose. Don't even think about it. This is not your
world.  
ROSE: But he's my dad and  
(She touches the advert, triggering a short film.)  
PETE [advert]: Trust me on this.  
ROSE: Well, that's weird. But he's real.  
PETE [advert]: Trust me on this.  
ROSE: He's a success. He was always planning these daft little schemes. Health
food, drinks and stuff. Everyone said they were useless. But he did it.  
DOCTOR: Rose, if you've ever trusted me, then listen to me now. Stop looking
at it. Your father's dead. He died when you were six months old. That is not
your Pete. That is a Pete. For all we know, he's got his own Jackie, his own
Rose. His own daughter who is someone else, but not you. You can't see him.
Not ever.  
PETE [advert]: Trust me on this. Trust me on this. Trust me on this. Trust me
on this.

**[The Tyler house]**

(Luxury Lexus PETE 1 crunches up the gravel driveway of a small mansion. Pete
Tyler gets out of the driver's seat holding a bouquet, and goes inside.)  
PETE: Hello? Sweetheart? Only me.  
(Jackie comes down the staircase.)  
JACKIE: Oh, the bad penny. Was this your idea? Don't deny it. It's got your
fingerprints all over it. Trust me on this. Oh, I can trust you all right.
Trust you to cock it up.  
PETE: What have I done now?  
JACKIE: Have a look.

**[Drawing room]**

(Servants are bustling about. A large banner is hung between two pillars -
Happy 40th Birthday.)  
PETE: What's wrong with that?  
JACKIE: Forty. It says forty.  
PETE: You are forty.  
JACKIE: Well, I don't want the whole world telling, do I?  
PETE: You're having a party tonight.  
JACKIE: My thirty ninth. My official biography says I was born on the same day
as Cuba Gooding Junior, and that makes me thirty nine, thank you very much.
Rose!

**[Entrance hall]**

(Jackie calls up the stairs.)  
JACKIE: Come here, Rose!  
PETE: These are from the girls in the office. Happy birthday.  
JACKIE: I've got hand sculpted arrangements by Veronica of Reykjavik, and your
secretary stopped off at a garage? I don't think so. And if you're giving out
presents, where's my Zeppelin? Everyone else has got one.  
JACKIE: Rose? Come on, Rose! Look, you didn't even notice, did you? Special
delivery. Got sent round today.  
(Jackie is wearing a very bling bluetooth-like device in each ears. Pete's are
quite ordinary by comparison.)  
JACKIE: Birthday present from Mister Lumic. Latest modal. Diamond studded.
Pick up signals from Venezuela.  
PETE: Why would you want to pick up signals from Venezuela?  
JACKIE: Well, I don't know, but now I can find out. For God's sake, where is
she? Rose? Oh, she needs a good bath before tonight. She's going to be
honking. Rose, come to mummy!  
(A tiny lap dog appears on the stairs. Jackie goes up to it.)  
JACKIE: Come on. There you are, my darling.  
(Pete's phone rings. He activates the earpiece.)  
PETE: Mister Lumic! Jackie was just saying thank you.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

PETE [OC]: That's very kind of you.  
(Lumic does not wear his own product.)  
LUMIC: Those ear pods are handmade. Tell her to take care.

**[Entrance hall]**

PETE: Course I will, course I will. I don't suppose you'd be joining us
tonight for the party? We'd be very honoured.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

LUMIC: The world below can party. Some of us have work to do.

**[Entrance hall]**

LUMIC [OC]: My plans have advanced, Peter. The President has

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

LUMIC: Promised a decision. I'm flying in now. We'll be at the airstrip by
five o'clock.  
PETE [OC]: Right.

**[Entrance hall]**

PETE: It's just that I promised I'd help the wife out tonight.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

LUMIC: If the President of Great Britain can make this meeting, then so can
you.

**[Entrance hall]**

PETE: Oh, I don't know. He's not married to Jackie, is he.

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

LUMIC: Five o'clock, Mister Tyler. Famous day.  
(The conversation ends. Lumic takes a breath from his oxygen tank, and talks
to his computer screen.)  
LUMIC: Voice print access, John Lumic. Initiate ear pod override. Subject
Jacqueline Tyler.  
(Jackie is in her bedroom, sitting at her dressing table and powdering
herself.)  
LUMIC: Activate.  
(Jackie is powdering her face at her dressing table when her face goes blank.
Rods come out of the ear pods and meet above her head, Cyberman-style.)  
LUMIC [OC]: Download Tyler residence, February the first. Give me security
arrangements for tonight. Passwords, encryptions, services.  
(The data is downloaded to Lumic's computer.)  
LUMIC: And restore.  
(The ear pods return to normal and Jackie carries on with her makeup.)  
LUMIC: Thank you, Misters Tyler. Activate picture link. Mister Crane?  
CRANE [on screen]: Mister Lumic?  
LUMIC: Events are moving faster than I anticipated. I need extra staff.  
CRANE [on screen]: Very good, sir.

**[Lorry cab]**

(Crane is in the passenger seat of an articulated lorry.)  
CRANE: I shall go on a recruitment drive. Back her up.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: I told you to keep an eye on her.  
MICKEY: She's all right.  
DOCTOR: She goes wandering off. Parallel world, it's like a gingerbread house.
All those temptations calling out.  
MICKEY: Oh, so it's just Rose, then? Nothing out there to tempt me?  
DOCTOR: Well, I don't know, I can't worry about everything. If I could just
get this thing to  
(The Doctor kicks the console.)  
MICKEY: Did that help?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
MICKEY: Did that hurt?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Ow.

**[Embankment]**

(Rose sits on a bench and watches the Thames, as Zeppelin propellers thrum
above. There are lots of them. Air traffic control must be grateful they move
so slowly. One passes overhead, barely missing the rooftop, then Rose's phone
beeps. She has a message from the Cybus Network - Welcome! Free Trial Period.
She gets IE24 News.)  
NEWSREADER [on phone]: And it's good news for Great Britain as John Lumic
returns to the country of his birth. Mister Lumic, the inventor of high
content metal, has denied allegations of ill health.  
LUMIC [on phone]: We're all flesh and blood, but the brain is what makes us
human. And my mind is more creative than ever.  
NEWSREADER [on phone]: With shares in Cybus Industries doubling in price,
Mister Lumic is  
(The Zeppelin continues to pass overhead, the noise from its rotors blocking
out the newsreader's words.)  
NEWSREADER [on phone]: In other news, the Torchwood Institute published a
study claiming that

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: We're not meant to be here. The Tardis draws it's power from the
universe, but it's the wrong universe. It's like diesel in a petrol engine.  
MICKEY: But I've seen it in comics. People go hopping from one alternative
world to another. It's easy.  
DOCTOR: Not in the real world. It used to be easy. When the Time Lords kept
their eye on everything, you could hop between realities, home in time for
tea. Then they died, and took it all with them. The walls of reality closed,
the worlds were sealed. Everything became that bit less kind.  
MICKEY: Then how did we get here?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. Accident? Should've been impossible. Now we're trapped.
What's that?  
(A tiny green light.)  
MICKEY: What?  
DOCTOR: That, there. Is that a reflection? It's a light! Is it? Is that a
light? I think that's a light. That's all we need. We've got power! Mickey,
we've got power! Ha!

**[Waste ground]**

(Opposite the Dome, the International Electromatics lorry backs in to where
homeless people are living.)  
CRANE: Gentlemen! Gentlemen! I beg your attention. Christmas has come early,
so come and get it. (The back of the lorry is opened and a ladder is lowered.
Most of the trailer interior is behind plastic sheeting.)  
CRANE: Oh, smell that, comrades. Burgers and chips. Sausage and beans. Pork,
chicken, and hot, sweet tea. All for free.  
(A young man runs up behind an older one.)  
JAKE: Don't go.  
MORRIS: But there's food!  
CRANE: All you can eat, free of charge. Don't just stand there. Fill your
faces with pasties and  
JAKE: He's lying.  
MORRIS: It's easy for you to say. When did you last starve?  
JAKE: All those people disappearing off the streets. It's been going on for
months. It's them. They're taking you away.  
CRANE: Tomato soup.  
MORRIS: What for?  
JAKE: Experiments.  
CRANE: But hurry, now.  
MORRIS: No, I'm so hungry.  
CRANE: So come and get it while it's hot. That's it, kind sir. Get in there
and fill your face.  
(Morris gets into the lorry. Jake uses a video camera whilst moving behind the
old homeless shelters.)  
CRANE: Feast yourself, brother. Feast yourself.  
(Screaming starts. The trailer doors are closed.)  
CRANE: Take them away.  
MORRIS: No! Help!

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor has got down below the main part of the console.)  
DOCTOR: It's alive!  
MICKEY: What is it?  
DOCTOR: It's nothing. It's tiny. One of those insignificant little power cells
that no one ever bothers about, and it's clinging onto life, with one little
ounce of reality tucked away inside.  
MICKEY: Enough to get us home?  
DOCTOR: Not yet. I need to charge it up.  
MICKEY: We could go outside and lash it up to the National Grid.  
DOCTOR: Wrong sort of energy. It's got to come from our universe.  
MICKEY: But we don't have anything.  
DOCTOR: There's me.  
(The Doctor cradles the green light in his hands and blows on it. It gets
brighter.)  
DOCTOR: I just gave away ten years of my life. Worth every second.  
(Rose uses her free trial to search for Peter Tyler on the Cybus Network.)  
MICKEY: It's going out. Is that okay?  
DOCTOR: It's on a recharging cycle. It'll loop round, power back up and be
ready to take us home in, oo, twenty four hours?  
MICKEY: So that gives us twenty four hours on a parallel world?  
DOCTOR: Shore leave. As long as we keep our heads down. Easy. No problem.
Let's go and tell her.

**[Embankment]**

(The Doctor has the power cell with him.)  
DOCTOR: There you are. You all right? No applause. I fixed it. Twenty four
hours, then we're flying back to reality. What is it?  
ROSE: My phone connected. There's this Cybus Network. It finds your phone. It
gave me Internet access.  
DOCTOR: Rose, whatever it says, this is the wrong world.  
ROSE: I don't exist.  
DOCTOR: What do you mean?  
ROSE: There's no Rose Tyler. I was never born. There's Pete, my dad, and
Jackie. He still married mum but they never had kids.  
DOCTOR: Give me that phone.  
ROSE: They're rich. They've got a house and cars, and everything they want.
But they haven't got me. I've got to see him.  
DOCTOR: You can't.  
ROSE: I just want to see him.  
DOCTOR: I can't let you.  
ROSE: You just said twenty four hours!  
DOCTOR: You can't become their daughter, that's not the way it works. Mickey,
tell her.  
MICKEY: Twenty four hours, yeah?  
DOCTOR: Where're you going?  
MICKEY: Well, I can do what I want.  
ROSE: I've got the address and everything.  
DOCTOR: Stay where you are, both of you. Rose, come back here! Mickey, come
back here right now!  
ROSE: I just want to see him.  
MICKEY: Yeah, I've got things to see and all.  
DOCTOR: Like what?  
MICKEY: Well, you don't know anything about me, do you? It's always about
Rose. I'm just a spare part.  
ROSE: I'm sorry. I've got to go.  
MICKEY: Go on, then. There's no choice, is there? You can only chase after one
of us. It's never going to be me, is it?  
DOCTOR: Back here, twenty four hours!  
(The Doctor runs after Rose.)  
MICKEY: Yeah. If I haven't found something better.

**[Airstrip]**

(Lumic's Zeppelin arrives. Pete Tyler is already there. An official Range
Rover brings security men and our black President.)  
PRESIDENT: Mister Tyler. What's the matter couldn't wait until tonight?  
PETE: Mister President. Honoured. I'm on the fast track program. Cybus
Industries have bought up my company, so I'm part of the firm now.  
PRESIDENT: Some people say they've bought my Government.  
PETE: I've never heard anybody say that. Never. You can trust me on this.  
PRESIDENT: I tried your drink, that Vitex stuff. It tastes like pop.  
PETE: Well, it is pop.  
PRESIDENT: You made money by selling a health food drink to a sick world. Not
quite the ordinary Joe you appear to be, are you? He does like to keep us
waiting. But tell me. You've had a chance to observe John Lumic more than
most. What's your opinion?  
PETE: He's very sharp, I'd say. Sharp as ever. Very clever man. Brilliant, in
fact.  
PRESIDENT: Then you don't think he's insane?  
PETE: That's not the word I would've used, no.  
PRESIDENT: I see.  
(The President goes up into the Zeppelin.)

**[Street]**

(Mickey walks past a vacant lot and up to an army roadblock.)  
MICKEY: Am I all right to get past?  
SOLDIER: Yeah. No bother. Curfew doesn't start till ten.  
MICKEY: There's a curfew?  
SOLDIER: Course there is. Where you been living, mate? Up there with the
toffs?  
(The Zeppelins.)  
MICKEY: I wish. See you.

**[Street 2]**

(Armed soldiers on patrol here, too. The Doctor has caught up to Rose.)  
ROSE: Mickey's mum just couldn't cope. His dad hung around for a while, but
then he just sort of wandered off. He was brought up by his gran. She was such
a great woman. God, she used to slap him! And then she died. She tripped and
fell down the stairs. It's about five years ago now. I was still in school.  
DOCTOR: I never knew.  
ROSE: Well, you never asked.  
DOCTOR: You never said.  
ROSE: That's Mickey. I suppose I, we just take him for granted. Do you think
she's still alive, his gran?  
DOCTOR: Could be. Like I said, parallel world, gingerbread house. We need to
get out of here as fast as we can.  
(There is a beeping sound and everyone stops still, including the policeman.)  
ROSE: What're they all doing?  
DOCTOR: They've stopped.  
(Everyone's ear pod flashes.)  
DOCTOR: It's the earpieces. Like Bluetooth attachments, but everyone's
connected together.  
ROSE: It's on my phone. It's automatic, look. It's downloading. Is this what
they're all getting? News, international news, sports, weather.  
DOCTOR: They get it direct. Downloaded right into their heads.  
ROSE: TV schedules, lottery numbers.  
DOCTOR: Everyone shares the same information. A daily download published by
Cybus Industries.  
(The next download is Joke. The people laugh, then continue about their
business.)  
DOCTOR: You lot, you're obsessed. You'd do anything for the latest upgrade.  
ROSE: Oi, not my lot. Different world, remember.  
DOCTOR: It's not so far off your world. This place is only parallel. Oh, look
at that. Cybus Industries, owners of just about every company in Britain,
including Vitex. Mister Pete Tyler's very well connected. Oh, okay. I give up.
Let's go and see him.

**[Waterton Street SE15]**

(Mickey rattles the knocker on number 1. An old West Indian woman calls out
from inside.)  
RITA ANNE [OC]: Who's that there?  
(The door opens. The woman has a white stick, and a pair of ear pods.)  
RITA ANNE: Who is it? I know you're there. Shame on you, tricking an old lady.
I've got nothing worth stealing. And don't think I'm going to disappear!
You're not going to take me.  
MICKEY: Hi.  
RITA ANNE: Is that you?  
MICKEY: It's me. I came home.  
RITA ANNE: Ricky?  
MICKEY: It's Mickey.  
RITA ANNE: I know my own grandson's name. It's Ricky. Now, come here.  
(They hug.)  
MICKEY: Okay, I'm Ricky. Of course I am. Ricky, that's me.  
(She slaps him.)  
MICKEY: Ow!  
RITA ANNE: You stupid boy. Where have you been?  
MICKEY: Ow! Stop hitting me!  
RITA ANNE: It's been days and days! I keep hearing all these stories. People
disappearing off the streets. There's nothing official on the download but
there're all these rumours, and, and whispers. I thought that God had
disappeared you!  
MICKEY: That carpet on the stairs, I told you to get it fixed. You're going to
fall and break your neck.  
RITA ANNE: Well, you get it fixed for me.  
MICKEY: I should have done way back. I guess I'm just kind of useless.  
RITA ANNE: Now, I never said that.  
MICKEY: I am, though. And I'm sorry, gran. I'm so sorry.  
RITA ANNE: Don't talk like that. Do you know what you need? A nice sit down
and a cup of tea. You got time?  
MICKEY: For you, I've got all the time in the world.  
RITA ANNE: Oh, you say that, but it's all talk. It's those new friends of
yours. I don't trust them.  
MICKEY: What friends are they?  
RITA ANNE: Don't pretend you don't know. You've been seeing them. Missus Chan
told me. Driving about all helter skelter in that van.  
MICKEY: What van's that, then?  
RITA ANNE: You know full well! Don't play games with me.  
(The van that does a handbrake turn in the road behind them.)  
RITA ANNE: Get inside.  
(Jake jumps out of the van and grabs Mickey.)  
JAKE: I've been looking for you everywhere!  
(He pushes Mickey into the van and they drive off.)  
RITA ANNE: Ricky! Ricky!

**[Van]**

JAKE: Ricky, you were the one who told us you don't contact your family
because it puts them in danger.  
MICKEY: Yeah. Ricky said that. Course I did, just testing.  
JAKE: I saw them. I taped them. They went round Blackfriars gathering up the
homeless like the child catcher. They must've took four dozen.  
(The blonde woman driver speaks.)  
MOORE: The vans were hired out to a company called International
Electromatics. But I did a protocol search. Turns out that's a dummy company
established by guess who?  
MICKEY: I don't know. Who?  
MOORE + JAKE: Cybus Industries!  
JAKE: Well, now we've got evidence.  
MOORE: Bad news is, they've arrested Thin Jimmy. So that just leaves you.  
MICKEY: Leaves me what?  
JAKE: The Number One. Top of the list. London's Most Wanted.  
MICKEY: Okay, cool. Say that again?

**[Lumic's Zeppelin]**

(A presentation is underway.)  
LUMIC: The most precious thing on this Earth is the human brain, and yet we
allow it to die. But now Cybus Industries has perfected a way of sustaining
the brain indefinitely within a cradle of copyrighted chemicals. And the
latest advances in synapse research allows cyberkinetic impulses to be bonded
onto a metal exoskeleton. This is the ultimate upgrade. Our greatest step into
cyberspace.  
PRESIDENT: I'm sorry. Could we stop it there? I don't need the pitch. I think
we all know what this ultimate upgrade entails. And I'm here to tell you,
John, the answer is no. My government does not give you permission. And I
think no government ever will.  
LUMIC: I prepared a paper for the Ethical Committee.  
PRESIDENT: Oh, come on. It's not just unethical. It's obscene.  
LUMIC: Mister President, if I might make a personal plea. I am dying, sir.  
PRESIDENT: I'm aware of that. And I'm very sorry.  
LUMIC: Without this project, you have condemned me. My inventions have
advanced this whole planet. Would you have all that perish?  
PRESIDENT: You're a fine businessman, John, but you're not God. I'm really
very sorry, but I think we should end it there. Mister Tyler, I'll see you
tonight. I think we could all do with a drink. Mister Lumic.  
(The President leaves with a man in a white boiler suit.)  
PETE: Still, it's not the only country in the world. There's always New
Germany.  
LUMIC: This is the home land. My birthplace. You may leave.  
PETE: Thank you, sir.  
(Pete leaves.)  
LUMIC: Mister Crane?  
CRANE [on screen]: Ready and waiting, sir.  
LUMIC: Did the override work?  
CRANE [on screen]: Well, needs a bit of fine tuning. We weren't exactly
delicate, given the rush, but

**[Control room]**

CRANE: Yeah, yeah. It's all working. I've been testing the system, sir.  
(A row of homeless men have flashing ear pods on.)  
CRANE: They've grafted on a treat, these have. Given a little persuasion. If
you care to observe, sir.  
(Crane uses a remote control.)  
CRANE: And turn to the right. And back to the left.  
(The men obey.)  
LUMIC [on screen]: Are you having fun, Mister Crane?  
CRANE: Oh, no, no, not at all, sir no. It's just, well, it's irresistible.  
LUMIC [on screen]: Then resist, and start the upgrade.  
CRANE: Did we get permission?  
LUMIC: I am governed by greater laws, old friend. The right of a man to
survive. Now begin!  
CRANE: And turn to the left. Forward march.  
(The controlled men walk off through a door. Screaming starts.)  
CRANE: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's cover up that noise. Er, give us
track number nineteen.  
(Wimoweh - The Lion Sleeps Tonight plays through the speakers. We are given
glimpses of slashing blades and cutting wheels and a large industrial complex
which zooms out to reveal it is the Battersea Power Station.)

**[Street]**

(Night.)  
JAKE: There's a light on. There's someone inside the base. Missis Moore, we've
got visitors.  
(Jake and Moore have a gun.)  
JAKE: One, two, three, go!

**[Base]**

(A familiar figure is inside the room. Mickey's jaw hits the floor.)  
RICKY: What the hell are you doing?  
JAKE: What're you doing there?  
RICKY: What am I doing here? What am I doing there?  
(Jake and Mrs Moore turn their guns on Mickey.)

**[Outside the Tyler House]**

(A stretched limo drives past the Doctor and Rose.)  
DOCTOR: They've got visitors.  
ROSE: February the first. Mum's birthday. Even in a parallel universe, she
still loves a party.  
DOCTOR: Well, given Pete Tyler's guest list, I wouldn't mind a look. And there
is one guaranteed way of getting inside.  
ROSE: Psychic paper.  
DOCTOR: Who do you want to be?

**[Tyler house]**

(Rose and the Doctor carry trays of canap�s and champagne for the guests
scattered through the ground floor.)  
ROSE: We could have been anyone.  
DOCTOR: Got us in, didn't it?  
ROSE: You're in charge of the psychic paper. We could've been guests.
Celebrities. Sir Doctor, Dame Rose. We end up serving. Did enough of this back
home.  
DOCTOR: If you want to know what's going on, work in the kitchens. According
to Lucy, that man over there  
ROSE: Who's Lucy?  
DOCTOR: She's carrying the salmon pinwheels.  
ROSE: Oh, that's Lucy, is it?  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Lucy says, that is the President of Great Britain.  
ROSE: What, there's a President, not a Prime Minister?  
DOCTOR: Seems so.  
ROSE: Or maybe Lucy's just a bit thick.  
(Pete is standing on the staircase.)  
PETE: Excuse me! Thank you very much. Thank you if I could just have your
attention, please?  
MAN: Pete! Go on, Pete!  
PETE: Thank you very much!  
MAN: It's about time you did some work.  
MAN 2: I thought you liked them young.  
PETE: Um, I'd just like to say thank you to you all, for coming on this, this
very special occasion. My wife's thirty ninth.  
MAN: Don't believe that one.  
PETE: Trust me on this. And so, without any further ado, here she is, the
birthday girl. My lovely wife, Jackie Tyler.  
(Jackie makes her entrance in skin tight black to general applause.)  
JACKIE: Now, I'm not giving a speech. That's what my parties are famous for.
No work, no politics, just a few good mates and plenty of black market whisky.
Pardon me, Mister President. So, yeah, get on with it. Enjoy, enjoy.  
DOCTOR: You can't stay. Even if there was some way of telling them.  
ROSE: Course I can't. I've still got Mum at home. My real mum. I couldn't just
leave her, could I. It's just, they've got each other. Mum's got no one.  
DOCTOR: She's got you. Those two haven't. All these different worlds, not one
of them gets it right.  
JACKIE: Rose! There's my little girl! Come to mummy, come to mummy!  
(Jackie picks up the dog.)  
JACKIE: Yes, good girl! Good girl, aren't you?  
(The Doctor laughs.)  
DOCTOR: Sorry.

**[Loading bay]**

CYBERMAN: Platoon zero two now boarding. Platoon zero two now boarding.  
(Heavy metal boots clump across the tarmac to the waiting lorries.)  
CRANE: Stop staring.  
DRIVER: What are they, sir?  
CRANE: I'm told they're the future. Ain't technology wonderful? Go on, get in
the cab. Start her up.  
DRIVER: Sir.  
(Crane's phone rings.)  
LUMIC [OC]: Mister Crane, are we mobile?  
CRANE: Just about to hit the road, sir. And yourself?  
LUMIC [OC]: I'm arriving, Mister Crane. Prepare the factory. Now, send them
forth, old friend. Let the good work begin.

**[Base]**

(Under a splendid 18th century painted ceiling, Mickey has been stripped and
tied to a chair, and is being carefully scanned.)  
JAKE: He's clean. No bugs.  
RICKY: But this is off the scale. He's flesh and blood. How did that happen?  
MOORE: Well, it could be that Cybus Industries have perfected the science of
human cloning, or your father had a bike.  
RICKY: And your name is Mickey, not Ricky.  
MICKEY: Mickey. Dad was Jackson Smith. Used to work at the key cutters in
Clifton's Parade. Went to Spain, never came back.  
RICKY: But that's my dad. So, we're brothers?  
JAKE: Be fair. What else could it be?  
RICKY: I don't know. But he doesn't just look like me, he is exactly the same.
There's something else going on here, Jake.  
MICKEY: So, who are you lot?  
RICKY: We? We are the Preachers. As in Gospel Truth. You see? No ear plugs.
While the rest of the world downloads from Cybus Industries, we, we have got
freedom. You're talking to London's Most Wanted, but target Number One is
Lumic, and we are going to bring him down.  
MICKEY: From your kitchen?  
RICKY: Have you got a problem with that?  
MICKEY: No, it's a good kitchen.  
MOORE: It's an upload from Gemini.  
MICKEY: Who's Gemini?  
MOORE: The vans are back. They're moving out of Battersea. Looks like Gemini
was right. Lumic's finally making a move.  
RICKY: And we are right behind him. Pack up, we're leaving.  
(The lorry drives past the base, and the van follows it. Everyone except
Mickey checks their weapons, machine guns etc.)

**[The Tyler's house]**

(The Doctor sneaks off and finds a working laptop. Rose watches Jackie
laughing with the President. Pete comes up to her.)  
PETE: I remember her twenty first. Pint of cider in the George.  
ROSE: Sorry. Champagne?  
PETE: Oh, might as well. I'm paying for it.  
ROSE: It's a big night for you.  
PETE: For her. Still, she's happy.  
ROSE: She should be. It's a great party.  
PETE: Do you think?  
ROSE: You can trust me.  
PETE: You can trust me on this.  
ROSE: That's it, sorry. So, how long have you two been married?  
PETE: Twenty years.  
ROSE: And no kids, or?  
PETE: We kept putting it off. She said she didn't want to spoil her figure.  
ROSE: It's not too late. She's only forty.  
PETE: Thirty nine.  
ROSE: Oh, right. Thirty nine.  
PETE: It's still too late. I moved out last month, but we're going to keep it
quiet. You know, it's bad for business. Why am I telling you all this? We
haven't met before, have we? I don't know, you just seem sort of  
ROSE: What?  
PETE: I don't know. Just sort of right. Stevie! How's things? How's it going
at Torchwood?

**[Outside the Tyler's house]**

(Ricky and Jake are hiding in the bushes, reporting in on a walkie-talkie.)  
RICKY: I don't know what they're doing, but this seems to be the target. Big
house, fair bit of money. Now we have got to find a way to get in.

**[Van]**

MOORE: I've identified the address. It belongs to Peter Tyler, the Vitex
millionaire.  
MICKEY: Pete Tyler?  
MOORE: He's listed as one of Lumic's henchmen. A traitor to the state.  
MICKEY: But

**[Outside the Tyler's house]**

MICKEY [OC] We've got to get in there.  
RICKY: Now, shut it, duplicate. That's what I just said.  
(A ramp is dropped down from the back of the lorry.)  
RICKY: What are they doing?  
(Heavy feet march down the ramp and onto the gravel.)  
RICKY: What the hell are they?

**[Office]**

(The Doctor has found Lumic's presentation on the laptop.)  
LUMIC [OC]: The most precious thing on this Earth is the human brain

**[Patio]**

(Jackie has gone outside to sit down.)  
ROSE: Missis Tyler, is there anything I can get you?  
JACKIE: The last twenty years back.  
ROSE: I can manage a glass of champagne or a nice cup of tea?  
JACKIE: Oh, that'd do me.  
(Rose sits next to Jackie.)  
ROSE: My mum loves that. End of a long night she never goes straight to bed,
she always stays up just to have that last cup of tea.  
JACKIE: Oh, I'm the same.  
ROSE: Two sugars.  
JACKIE: And me. Pete always says, you know. Ah, never mind him.  
ROSE: I was talking to him earlier. He's a nice man. You know, bit of a Jack
the Lad, I suppose, even if he has got money, but he's a good bloke. Better
than most. He's worth a second chance.  
JACKIE: Are you commenting on my marriage?  
ROSE: No, I was just  
JACKIE: Who the hell do you think you are? You're staff. You're nothing but
staff. You're just the serving girl, for God's sake. And you are certainly not
getting paid. Don't you dare talk to me.  
(Jackie goes back inside. Suddenly, floodlights come on, backlighting rows of
marching figures, dainty as elephants.)

**[Office]**

LUMIC [OC]: This is the ultimate upgrade. Our greatest step into cyberspace.  
DOCTOR: Cybers.

**[Drawing room]**

(The Doctor and Rose meet up and go to the window.)  
DOCTOR: It's happening again.  
ROSE: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: I've seem them before.  
ROSE: What are they?  
DOCTOR: Cybermen.  
(The Cybermen smash through a series of French windows in the other wall.
Others march in through the house. The guests are surrounded. The President's
telephone rings.)  
PRESIDENT: Mister Lumic.

**[Control room]**

LUMIC: Mister President. I suppose a remark about crashing the party would be
appropriate at this point.

**[Drawing room]**

PRESIDENT: I forbade this.

**[Control room]**

LUMIC: These are my children, sir. Would you deny my family?

**[Drawing room]**

ROSE: What are they, robots?  
DOCTOR: Worse than that.  
PRESIDENT: Who were these people?

**[Control room]**

LUMIC: Doesn't matter.

**[Drawing room]**

ROSE: They're people?  
DOCTOR: They were, until they had all their humanity taken away. That's a
living brain jammed inside a cybernetic body, with a heart of steel. All
emotions removed.  
ROSE: Why no emotions?  
DOCTOR: Because it hurts.  
PRESIDENT: I demand to know, Lumic. These people, who were they?  
LUMIC [OC]: They were homeless

**[Control room]**

LUMIC: And wretched and useless

**[Drawing room]**

LUMIC [OC]: Until I saved them, and elevated them, and gave them life eternal.

**[Control room]**

LUMIC: And now I leave you in their capable hands. Goodnight, sir.

**[Drawing room]**

LUMIC [OC]: Goodnight, Mister President.  
CYBERMAN: We have been upgraded.  
DOCTOR: Into what?  
CYBERMAN: The next level of mankind. We are Human point two. Every citizen
will receive a free upgrade. You will become like us.  
PRESIDENT: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for what's been done to you, but listen to
me. This experiment ends tonight.  
CYBERMAN: Upgrading is compulsory.  
PRESIDENT: And if I refuse?  
DOCTOR: Don't.  
PRESIDENT: What if I refuse?  
DOCTOR: I'm telling you, don't.  
PRESIDENT: What happens if I refuse?  
CYBERMAN: Then you are not compatible.  
PRESIDENT: What happens then?  
CYBERMAN: You will be deleted.  
(The Cyberman puts his hand on the President's neck, and electrocutes him. The
Doctor grabs Rose and runs. The guests scream as they get grabbed and killed.)  
PETE: Jackie! Jackie!

**[Outside the Tyler house]**

(The Doctor and Rose jump through a window.)  
DOCTOR: There's nothing we can do.  
ROSE: My mum's in there!  
DOCTOR: She is not your mother! Come on!  
(A row of Cybermen stop them from running across the lawn. They turn back and
run around the side of the house as Pete comes out through the window.)  
ROSE: Quick! Quick!  
(Pete follows the Doctor and Rose. Jackie runs down into the cellar. A
Cyberman follows carefully. It's feet are twice as big as the steps.)  
DOCTOR: Pete, is there a way out?  
PETE: The side gates. Who are you? How do you know so much?  
DOCTOR: You wouldn't believe it in a million years.  
(More Cybermen cut them off. Two armed figures come running across the lawn in
front of the floodlights.)  
ROSE: Who's that?  
RICKY: Get behind me!  
(Ricky and Jake open fire on the Cybermen, but the bullets just bounce off.
The Cybermen stop.)  
ROSE: Oh my God, look at you.  
(Rose hugs Ricky.)  
ROSE: I thought I'd never see you again!  
RICKY: Yeah. No offence, sweetheart, but who the hell are you?  
MICKEY: Rose! That's not me. That's like the other one.  
DOCTOR: Oh, as if things weren't bad enough, there's two Mickey's.  
RICKY: It's Ricky.  
MICKEY: But there's more of them.  
ROSE: We're surrounded.  
DOCTOR: Put the guns down. Bullets won't stop them.  
(Jake starts shooting. The Doctor stops him.)  
DOCTOR: No! Stop shooting, now. We surrender! Hands up. There's no need to
damage us. We're good stock. We volunteer for the upgrade program. Take us to
be processed.  
CYBERMAN: You are rogue elements.  
DOCTOR: But we surrender.  
CYBERMAN: You are incompatible.  
DOCTOR: But this is a surrender.  
CYBERMAN: You will be deleted.  
DOCTOR: But we're surrendering! Listen to me, we surrender!  
CYBERMAN: You are inferior. Man will be reborn as Cyberman, but you will
perish under maximum deletion.  
(The Cybermen hold out their deadly arms towards the group.)  
CYBERMAN: Delete. Delete. Delete!
