**Dark Water**  
  
Original Airdate: 1 Nov 2014  

**[Park]  
  
**(Danny Pink walks past the magnificent war memorial in Alexandra Gardens,
Cathays Park, Cardiff whilst pretending to be in Shoreditch, London. His
mobile phone rings.)  
DANNY: Clara!  
CLARA [OC]: Shut up.  
DANNY: Is that how we communicate now?  
  
**[Clara's flat]**  
  
CLARA: Shut up, shut up, shut up. I need to talk to you.  
  
**[Park]**  
  
DANNY: All right. Well, I'll be there in a couple of minutes, so  
  
**[Clara's flat]**  
  
No, no, Not while you're in the room.  
  
**[Park]**  
  
DANNY: Oh, stupid me. The very idea.  
  
**[Clara's flat]**  
  
CLARA: Shut up!  
DANNY [OC]: Okay.  
CLARA: Stay shut up.  
  
**[Park]**  
  
DANNY: Okay.  
CLARA [OC]: Things to say.  
  
**[Clara's flat]**  
  
CLARA: Not all of them good.  
DANNY [OC]: Oh, wouldn't it be better  
  
**[Park]**  
  
DANNY: If I was actually there?  
CLARA [OC]: Oh, Danny, everything is  
  
**[Clara's flat]**  
  
CLARA: Better when you're here, but maybe  
(She turns to look at the array of post-it notes on her bookshelves. Some say
PSI, Impossible Girl, Saibra, Vastra, Blinovitch, Robin Hood, Lying, Dinosaur
in London.)  
CLARA: Maybe not this. Okay Er. Okay, before all of that. Before all of the
stuff  
  
**[Park]**  
  
CLARA [OC]: That I did wrong  
  
**[Clara's flat]  
  
**(She takes down the note that says Just _Say_ It.)  
CLARA: I love you.  
  
**[Road]**  
  
DANNY: I love you.  
(Danny is walking out towards the main road.)  
CLARA: No, not like that. Not like it's automatic.  
  
**[Clara's flat]  
  
**CLARA: Not like it's how you end the phone call, the sign off, the pat on
the back.  
  
**[Park]**  
  
DANNY: Clara  
  
**[Clara's flat]**  
  
CLARA: Danny, I'll never say those words again. Not to anybody else, ever.
Those words, from me, are yours now.  
(Danny walks out onto the main road. Clara doesn't get a reply so after a
pause -)  
CLARA: So, er. That's a thing.  
(Just the sound of cars travelling on the road.)  
CLARA: Okay, Danny? Er, there's more but that's kind of the headline. Okay,
Danny, please speak to me, This is, this is killing me.  
(Still nothing.)  
CLARA: Danny, I love you. And you are the last person who's ever going to hear
me say that.  
WOMAN [OC]: Hello? Hello, is someone there?  
CLARA: Hello? Er, yeah. Who's this?  
WOMAN [OC]: I just picked up the phone, I'm sorry. I found it.  
CLARA: Oh. Er, okay. Er, can you please just put me back on the phone to
Danny? I was talking to Danny.  
WOMAN [OC]: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.  
CLARA: Okay, er, what are you sorry about? Could you please just pass the
phone back to  
WOMAN [OC]: He was crossing the road. 'I found the phone, it must have just
got thrown. The car, it just came out of nowhere.  
  
**[Road]**  
  
WOMAN: I'm so sorry.  
(The traffic is at a standstill. People have stopped to look, and the
emergency services are on their way, sirens wailing. Clara drops the phone and
runs along the street. She gets there just as the police are taping the scene
off.)  
  
ARMITAGE [OC]: By now, I'm sure you've heard the rumours, and it is with great
sadness that I must confirm them to be true.  
(A little shrine with photographs, notes and flowers is set up at the park
entrance.)  
ARMITAGE [OC]: I have gathered you all here today to say that Mister Pink,
that Danny Pink has sadly passed away. I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing
his family and friends our sincerest condolences. Mister Pink was an
inspiration to all of those who knew him. A soldier, a teacher, a friend. It
was no secret that he had a close relationship with Miss Oswald, and our
thoughts and prayers are with her too.  
(The Tardis is sitting on a ledge in a volcanic caldera.)  
  
**[Clara's kitchen]**  
  
(Full of Calla lilies and sympathy cards. Her phone is ringing, and continues
to ring throughout the scene. Caller ID says it is The Doctor calling. Clara's
gran walks in.)  
GRAN: Hello, love. You all right? Oh, of course you're not. Sorry. Of course
you're not all right. You know what you should do? You should cry. Let go.  
CLARA: Of what?  
GRAN: It's a terrible thing. Just a terrible, terrible thing.  
CLARA: It wasn't terrible.  
GRAN: Clara?  
CLARA: It was boring.  
GRAN: Boring?  
CLARA: It was ordinary. People just kept walking with their iPods and their
shopping bags. He was alive, and then he was dead and it was nothing. Like
stepping off a bus.  
GRAN: He deserved better. And so did you.  
CLARA: I don't deserve anything. Nobody deserves anything. But I am owed
better. I am owed.  
GRAN: Who owes you?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Clara! Clara?  
(Clara picks up the phone and puts on a cheerful face. So, she was actually
calling him?)  
CLARA: Hey!  
  
**[Tardis]**  
  
(The Doctor enters.)  
DOCTOR: Sorry, I was busy. What's happening?  
  
**[Clara's kitchen]**  
  
CLARA: Oh, nothing. You know, same old, same old.  
  
**[Tardis]**  
  
DOCTOR: Well, you're only human.  
  
**[Clara's kitchen]**  
  
DOCTOR [OC]: So what I can do for you, Clara?  
  
**[Cauldera]**  
  
(The Doctor is lying outside the Tardis as the volcano spits lava and lumps of
rock. He wakes with a start to see Clara standing in the smoke by the edge of
the ledge.)  
DOCTOR: Clara?  
  
**[Tardis]**  
  
(Clara enters. The Doctor is working on a piece of machinery.)  
CLARA: Start her up.  
DOCTOR: Where are we going?  
CLARA: Away.  
DOCTOR: From?  
CLARA: Just away.  
DOCTOR: Well, normally you say work or kids or dishes or dullness. So what's
happened?  
(Clara goes downstairs to his workbench, takes a key from a round box and puts
it in her coat pocket.)  
CLARA: A volcano.  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry?  
CLARA: I've never seen an active volcano, do you know one?  
DOCTOR: What's so great about seeing a volcano? It's just a sort of leaky
mountain.  
CLARA: I've never seen lava.  
(She takes something out of his coat pocket and puts it into hers.)  
DOCTOR: It's rubbish.  
CLARA: Prove it.  
  
**[Cauldera]**  
  
CLARA: It's on your neck.  
  
**[Tardis]  
  
**(In flight. Clara finds another key hidden inside The Time Traveller's Wife.
Good book, interesting concept.)  
CLARA: Do you still have those sleep patch things?  
DOCTOR: You can't have one.  
CLARA: I'm having trouble sleeping.  
DOCTOR: You still can't have one.  
CLARA: Can I have one?  
DOCTOR: No, you can't have one.  
(So Clara takes the box of them from a small set of drawers.)  
DOCTOR: So, volcano. What's so good about lava?  
(Clara puts one of the patches on the back of the Doctor's neck.)  
  
**[Cauldera]**  
  
(Clara is holding out her hand.)  
CLARA: You told me once what it would take to destroy a Tardis key. That's
what's so good about lava. All seven. From all of your hiding places.  
(She holds one up.)  
DOCTOR: Clara, what are you doing? Don't. Be very, very careful with that.
Those are very, very  
(She throws it backwards into the lava.)  
CLARA: Do I have your attention?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
CLARA: Good.  
DOCTOR: No. Not good, Clara.  
CLARA: Danny Pink.  
DOCTOR: Yeah?  
CLARA: Is dead.  
DOCTOR: And?  
CLARA: Seriously?  
DOCTOR: And?  
CLARA: And fix it. Change it. Change what happened. Save him. Bring him back.  
(She holds up another key and we all remember what happened in Father's Day.)  
DOCTOR: No.  
(She throws the key away.)  
CLARA: Five left. Every time you say no to me, I will throw another key down
there. Do we understand each other?  
DOCTOR: Well, I understand you. Let's not get carried away.  
CLARA: Time can be rewritten.  
DOCTOR: With precision. With great care. And not today. But you know that of
course, otherwise you wouldn't be threatening me.  
CLARA: Did you just say no?  
DOCTOR: If I change the events that brought you here, you will never come here
and ask me to change those events. Paradox loop. The timeline disintegrates.
Your timeline. And yes!  
CLARA: Yes?  
DOCTOR: Yes. I did just say no. Throw away the key.  
CLARA: I have seen you change time, I have seen you break any rule you want.  
DOCTOR: I know when I can, I know when I can't. Throw the key.  
CLARA: I know what you're doing. You're trying to take control.  
DOCTOR: I am in control. Throw away the key. Do as you are told.  
CLARA: No!  
DOCTOR: Well, either you do as you're told or stop threatening me. There
really isn't a third option here.  
CLARA: Do you know what, Doctor? When it comes to taking control, you really
are out of your depth.  
(She throws all the remaining keys bar one into the lava.)  
CLARA: One last chance. And I don't care about the rules, I don't give a damn
about paradoxes. Save Danny. Bring him back or I swear you will never step
inside your Tardis again.  
DOCTOR: No.  
CLARA: Do as you are told.  
DOCTOR: No.  
CLARA: Say it again so I know you mean it.  
DOCTOR: No!  
CLARA: I'm not kidding, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Neither am I.  
CLARA: I will do it!  
DOCTOR: Clara, my Clara, I don't think you will!  
(The last key goes into the lava.)  
CLARA: Oh, I'd say I'm sorry but I'd do it again.  
(Clara falls to her knees and cries.)  
CLARA: I'd do it again. Well, what are you doing? Why are you just standing
there? Do you understand what I have just done?  
DOCTOR: Look in your hand.  
CLARA: There's nothing in my hand.  
DOCTOR: Clara, look in your hand.  
CLARA: The keys, they're gone. They're down there. They've gone.  
DOCTOR: Clara, look in your hand.  
CLARA: There's nothing in my hand.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, there is. Look.  
(The sleep patch is in the middle of Clara's palm.)  
DOCTOR: Did you seriously think that that was going to work on me?  
(And back into the Tardis, to when Clara put the patch on the Doctor's neck.
He grabs her hand and neatly presses the patch into her palm instead.)  
DOCTOR: They're not sleep patches. They induce a dream state.  
(He removes the patch from her palm.)  
  
**[Tardis]**  
  
DOCTOR: Makes you very suggestible.  
(He picks up the Tardis keys from the floor.)  
DOCTOR: I allowed the whole scenario to play out just as you planned. I was
curious about how far you would go.  
CLARA: Well, now you know.  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Now I know.  
CLARA:I love him.  
(The Doctor scans her with the sonic screwdriver.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite the mess of chemicals, aren't you?  
CLARA: So, what now? What do we do now? You and me, what happens now? Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Go to hell.  
(The Tardis lands.)  
CLARA: Fair enough. Absolutely fair enough.  
(She walks to the door.)  
DOCTOR: Clara? You asked me what we're going to do. I told you. We're going to
hell. Or wherever it is people go when they die. If there is anywhere.
Wherever it is, we're going to go there and we're going to find Danny. And if
it is in any way possible, we're going to bring him home. Almost every culture
in the universe has some concept of an afterlife. I always meant to have a
look around, see if I could find one.  
CLARA: You're going to help me?  
DOCTOR: Well, why wouldn't I help you?  
CLARA: Because of what I just did. I just  
DOCTOR: You betrayed me. Betrayed my trust, you betrayed our friendship, you
betrayed everything that I've ever stood for. You let me down!  
CLARA: Then why are you helping me?  
DOCTOR: Why? Do you think I care for you so little that betraying me would
make a difference? Stop it with the eyes. Don't do that with the eyes. How do
you do that anyway? It's like they inflate. Cut out the whining while you're
at it. We've got work to do. This is it, Clara, one of those moments.  
CLARA: What moments?  
DOCTOR: The darkest day. The blackest hour. Chin up, shoulders back. Let's see
what we're made of, you and I. Switching off the safeguards, turning off the
nav-com. Remember, we did this before. We plugged you into the Tardis
telepathic interface.  
CLARA: We ended up all over Danny's timestream.  
DOCTOR: Because you and he are linked. Strongly linked. Your timestreams are
intertwined. So if he's anywhere at all, that link will hold. Give me your
hands.  
CLARA: Doctor  
DOCTOR: We're in a hurry.  
CLARA: I don't deserve a friend like you.  
DOCTOR: Clara, I'm terribly sorry, but I'm exactly what you deserve.  
(He puts her hands into the orange gloop part of the console.)  
DOCTOR: Think about Danny. Think about the man you lost. Let it hurt. Let it
burn. But don't bleat. Don't ask, why him? Why me? Forget all that. Ask one
question. Just one. Ask, where is Danny Pink now? Where is he now?  
(And after a few moments, the time rotor starts up.)  
DOCTOR: Well, the Tardis thinks he's somewhere.

**[Seb's office]**

(Danny is sitting at a desk with his head resting on his hand. It slips and he
wakes. Somewhere a phone rings, and it sounds like a busy office outside. He
looks around at a set of in-trays, pens in holders, and a name plate on the
desk which says - Nethersphere After Death Department SEB. The company logo is
a very large circle with a small one attached at seven o'clock. The door
opens.)  
SEB: Has anyone offered you a coffee?  
DANNY: Um. Well, no.  
SEB: Could we have some coffee along here, please? The good kind. We've got a
new one.  
(Seb shuts the door and sits at his desk.)  
SEB: Five minutes, tops. Best to wait for the good coffee.  
DANNY: Where am I?  
SEB: Sometimes it's just the instant.  
(Seb pulls a 'nasty taste' face.)  
DANNY: Where am I?  
SEB: Well, big question. Try to take that one slowly. We have been trying to
contact family members, but really there is so much admin  
DANNY: I wasn't here, I was  
SEB: Yeah. That last thing that happened to you, that really happened, I'm
afraid. But that's life. Well, not life, I suppose, but. There are some forms
to fill in. Might help you relax.  
Well, they won't, but we do need them filled in. Right, important thing. Need
to know. Are you being cremated? Sorry, it's a fairly urgent question.  
DANNY: I don't know. I've never really thought of that.  
SEB: I'm going to put you down as a yes, that's pretty much the default these
days. If people only knew.  
DANNY: Only knew what?  
(Seb rolls his chair back to the door and shouts through the wall.)  
SEB: We've got a burner in number twelve. Tell them to prep, please.  
DANNY: Burner?  
(Seb rolls back to the deck.)  
SEB: Yeah, it's fine, we'll come to that.  
DANNY: But I don't understand where I am.  
(Seb looks at the large pair of curtains covering one wall. Danny gets up and
opens them, then gasps. He is looking out of a round window at a host of
buildings which appear to be on the inside of a small Dyson Sphere.)  
SEB: Oh, look at that. You can see my house from here. Yeah, sorry, probably
not helping.  
DANNY: Where am I? Er.  
SEB: You sort of know, don't you? Most people kind of know, it's just hard to
get traction on the concept.  
DANNY: Where am I?  
SEB: Okay. You're dead, and this is what's next.  
DANNY: I'm not dead. How can I be dead?  
SEB: Our sincere condolences.  
DANNY: I'm standing right here.  
SEB: Yes, you are. Welcome to the Underworld. Otherwise known as the
Nethersphere, or the Promised Land. It's where you go when you die.  
(Danny starts to hyperventilate.)  
SEB: Would you like to breathe into a bag?  

**[Tardis]**  

(The Tardis materialises.)  
CLARA: Where are we?  
DOCTOR: Nav-com's offline. We'll have to do this old school.  
CLARA: But this is where Danny is?  
DOCTOR: Almost certainly not. It's where there's a connection with Danny.
According to the Tardis, this is where it's most likely that your timeline
will re-intersect with his. And that won't do.  
CLARA: What won't?  
DOCTOR: You won't. Look at you. I need sceptical, clever, critical. I don't
need mopey. It put years on your face. And what if people see us together? It
looks like you've been melted.  
CLARA: Are you forgetting why we're here?  
DOCTOR: We're here to get your boyfriend back from the dead, so buck up and
give me some attitude.  

**[Entrance lobby]**  

(The Tardis has parked herself between two of four columns at the bottom of a
set of steps leading up to a large urn on a plinth, which has an eternal flame
burning in it. The place is dark, and the Doctor shines a torch on an small
obelisk with the Company logo on it in gold and the words Rest In Peace, We
Promise carved into the granite. They look up at ranks and ranks of glass
fronted cubicles on three sides of this marble edifice. There is the sound of
water nearby.)  
CLARA: Fish tanks?  
DOCTOR: In a mausoleum?  
(They go up the steps to the urn. Its plinth also has the logo and motto on
it.)  
CLARA: What does that mean?  
DOCTOR: It means those are definitely not fish tanks.  
(They turn right at the urn and enter - )

**[Gallery]**  

(Lined on the right hand side with floor to ceiling tanks. Each contains a
skeleton sitting on a chair.)  
CLARA: Why?  
DOCTOR: I don't know.  
CLARA: Okay, I'm assuming they didn't actually drown in there.  
DOCTOR: No. They were placed, after death. These are tombs. Water tombs, some
sort of fluid, anyway.  
CLARA: With chairs?  
DOCTOR: With chairs, yes. Extra comfort for the deceased. It pays to die rich.  
(There is a name under each tank. Clara looks at Xylo Jones then moves on.)  
CLARA: Oh, God. Am I going to find Danny now? Is that why the Tardis brought
us here? I don't want to see him like that.  
DOCTOR: Good point. Tombs with windows. Who wants to watch their loved ones
rot? Why would anyone go to so much trouble just to keep watch on the dead?  
(As they walk on, a skeleton turns its head to watch them. The Doctor finds a
small book on a lecturn. He opens his fingers across a blank page and a cube
rises up out of it. He pushes it into the corridor and opens it. It displays
that two ring logo with 3W inside it while Bach's Air on a G String plays
softly. A voice speaks the words that then scroll down.)  
MISSY [OC]: 3W. Death is not an end. But we can we help with that. Ever since
3W encountered the truth about the death experience, 'we have been working
hard to find a better life for the deceased. At 3W, afterlife means aftercare.  
CLARA: Okay. Bit strange?  
DOCTOR: Very. Why have the scrolling and a voice? Is it difficult?  
CLARA: Is what difficult?  
DOCTOR: Reading all those words back to front. Come on. We've come a long way.  
(Missy walks through the logo, which disappears.)  
MISSY: Hello. I hope you're well. How may I assist you with your death?  
DOCTOR: Well, there is, er, no immediate hurry. We're just, er. We're just  
CLARA: Browsing.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, browsing.  
MISSY: Please, take all the time you need. At 3W, you always have the rest of
your life.  
DOCTOR: Oh, good. That's good to know, Clara, isn't it?  
CLARA: Yeah. Great.  
DOCTOR: Exactly what is 3W?  
MISSY: Apologies. Clearly you have not received the official 3W greetings
package.  
DOCTOR: Well, you know, it's just an unexpected  
(Missy lunges at the Doctor, pushing him against the wall then kissing him
very intently. The Doctor's eyes bulge and he grabs the wall. Missy finishes
by kissing the tip of his nose three times, then she steps back.)  
MISSY: Welcome to the 3W Institute.  
DOCTOR: (breathless) Clara, is it over now?  
CLARA: I think it's over, yeah.  
MISSY: You also have not received the official welcome package.  
CLARA: Oh, I'm good, thanks. No worries.  
DOCTOR: Who are you?  
MISSY: I am Missy.  
CLARA: Missy?  
MISSY: Mobile Intelligent Systems Interface. I am a multi-function,
interactive welcome-droid. Helping you to help me to help you.  
DOCTOR: You're very er realistic.  
CLARA: Tongues?  
DOCTOR: Shut up.  
MISSY: I am fully programmed with social interaction norms appropriate to a
range of visitors. Please indicate if you'd like me to adjust my intimacy
setting.  
(The Doctor peels himself off the wall.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, please. Please do that. Do that now right now.  
CLARA: Maybe just a tad, yeah.  
DOCTOR: I need to speak to whoever's in charge here.  
MISSY: (as Maggie Smith) I am in charge.  
DOCTOR: Well, who's in charge of you?  
MISSY: I'm in charge of me.  
DOCTOR: Well, who repairs you? Who, who maintains you?  
MISSY: I am programmed for self-repair. I am maintained by my heart.  
(Missy takes the Doctor's hand and places it on her bosom.)  
MISSY: Is everything in order?  
DOCTOR: Who maintains your heart?  
MISSY: My heart is maintained by the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Doctor who?  
MISSY: (shouts) Doctor Chang!  
(Missy walks away from the Doctor, who doesn't move his hand.)  
CHANG [OC]: Who's there?  
CHANG: Hello?  
CLARA: Hello.  
DOCTOR: Hello.  
CLARA: You can probably take your hand down now, Doctor.  
CHANG: So. Hey. Condolences.  
CLARA: Condolences?  
CHANG: It's a mausoleum. It's our hello. Is there a particular dead person you
want to talk to?  
CLARA: Yes. Yes, there is.  
CHANG: This way then.  
DOCTOR: Are you okay?  
CLARA: No.  
(He takes her hand.)  
DOCTOR: Good. There would be something very wrong if you were.  
(All the skeletons turn their heads to watch them leave. Missy smiles, then
looks up at a red spotted globe turning up in the corner.)  

**[Balcony]**  

(Seb opens the doors and lets Danny go first into the night air with emergency
vehicle sirens wailing in the distance.)  
SEB: Bit of fresh air. Do you good.  
DANNY: Why's it so cold here?  
SEB: And the Wi-Fi is better out here. Don't know why.  
DANNY: Wi-Fi?  
SEB: Yeah, still a bit spotty, but basically  
DANNY: You have Wi-Fi here?  
(Seb is calling something up on his tablet computer.)  
DANNY: You. You have iPads in the afterlife?  
SEB: IPads? We have Steve Jobs. Listen, another big question for you. Have you
ever killed anybody?  
DANNY: This is surreal.  
SEB: Imagine embryos had telephones.  
DANNY: That's really not helping.  
SEB: Go with me. Go with me. Imagine babies in wombs could talk to other
babies in other wombs. What would they say? What would they think life was
like if they could talk among themselves?  
DANNY: I really have no idea.  
SEB: They'd think that life was nine months long. Then, boom, trap door opens,
out you fall, gone for ever. Never hear from those guys again. Nothing at the
end of the cord.  
DANNY: Okay.  
SEB: This isn't really an afterlife. It's just more life than you were
expecting.  
DANNY: Why did you ask me if I'd killed anyone?  
SEB: Before you were a teacher, you spent some time as a soldier.  
DANNY: Yeah, so?  
SEB: Any regrets? Bad memories?  
DANNY: Is that, is that any of your business?  
SEB: Yes.

**[Memories]**  

(In either Iraq or Afghanistan, Danny and his troop are returning fire in a
village.)  
SOLDIER: Get to cover, now!  

**[Balcony]**  

SEB: Sorry if I triggered something then. Memory flashes can be very impactful
in the early stages.  
DANNY: Why?  
SEB: Why what?  
(Danny recalls taking a grenade from his pouch and throwing it into the
remains of a building.)  
DANNY: Why is it any of your business?  
SEB: We've had a request to meet you. Any idea who that would be from?  
(Danny recalls bursting into a building and immediately opening fire.)  
SEB: It's been given a priority, which usually means  
DANNY: Means what?  
(Danny has shot someone.)  
SEB: Well, anyway, we've arranged a meet-up.  
DANNY: When?  
SEB: Come in.  
(Danny sees the person from his memories. A young boy in a football shirt is
peering around the door.) **  
** SOLDIER [OC]: Danny, repeat, is the building secure?'  
SEB: So, I guess you remember him, yeah?  
SOLDIER [OC]: Danny? Danny!  

**[Chang's office]**  

CHANG: Come in, come in. Going to need to take a reading off you.  
(There is one of those big tanks in here, too. The Doctor goes to take a look
around.)  
CLARA: A reading?  
CHANG: Won't hurt.  
(He flicks a switch.)  
CLARA: What won't?  
DOCTOR: How does the body keep its integrity? Why isn't it just a bunch of
bones floating about?  
CHANG: Each body is encased in a support exoskeleton.

CLARA [OC]: An invisible exoskeleton?  
CHANG: It's only invisible in the water. There's a specially engineered
refraction index in the fluid so we can see the tank resident unimpeded by the
support mechanisms.  
(Missy is listening to the conversation.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: So each skeleton is inside something?  
(She puts her hand on a tank and a skeletal hand reaches out.)  

**[Chang's office]**  

CLARA: Are you serious? X-ray water?  
CHANG: It's so cool. Look at this. We call it dark water.  
(He puts his arm into a sample jar of it. His wrist watch and jacket sleeve
vanish.)  
CHANG: Only organic matter can be seen through it.  
(He removes his arm and dries it off.)  
CHANG: I keep saying they should use this stuff in swimming pools.  
DOCTOR: Why?  
CHANG: Think about it.  
DOCTOR: I am thinking about it. Why?  
CLARA: Doesn't matter. 3W, what kind of name is that? What does it mean?  
(The skeleton in the tank behind them turns its head.)  
CHANG: Well, you know, don't you? You're here on business or they wouldn't
have let you in. Sorry. Should have checked. Who are you?  
DOCTOR: I thought that you would never ask. Sort out your security protocols,
they're a disgrace.  
(He gets out the psychc paper.)  
CHANG: Another government inspection? So soon? Why is there all this swearing?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I've got a lot of internalised anger. What does 3W stand for?  
CHANG: Well, the three words.  
CLARA: What three words?  
CHANG: Seriously? You don't know?  
DOCTOR: Never mind what we know and what we don't know, just answer our
question.  
CHANG: Because people who don't know, when they hear about this, they can
freak out.  
DOCTOR: We're not going to freak out.  
CHANG: If you've had a recent loss, this might be, this _will be_ disturbing.  
DOCTOR: She'll be fine.  
CLARA: Speak for me again, I'll detach something from you. I'll be fine.  
CHANG: You know how people are scared of dying? Like, everybody.  
DOCTOR: Of course. It's the most fundamental fear in the universe.  
CHANG: They'd be a lot more scared if they knew what it was really like.  
(Chang activates the see through computer screen on his desk.)  

**[Balcony]**  

(Danny is sitting at the table opposite the young boy.)  
DANNY: So. You okay? I'm sorry. I just  
(Danny reaches for the boy's hand. He recoils and runs off.)  
DANNY: Hey, hey. Hey, listen. Listen Hey!  
SEB: Probably best not, eh? Doesn't speak much.  
DANNY: Why would he want to see me?  
(A man screams in agony nearby.)  
DANNY: What the hell is that?  
SEB: Sounds like somebody left their body to science. Okay. Er, It's probably
time to explain why you're always feeling cold.

**[Chang's office]**  

CHANG: White noise off the telly. We've all heard it. A few years ago, Doctor
Skarosa, our founder, did something unexpected. He played that noise through a
translation matrix of his own devising. This is a recording of what he heard.  
(A sound wave of multiple voices.)  
CLARA: Okay, people, voices.  
DOCTOR: So what?  
CHANG: Over time, Doctor Skarosa became convinced these were the voices of the
recently departed. He believed it was a telepathic communication from the
dead.  
DOCTOR: Why? Was he an idiot?  
CHANG: He was able to isolate some of the voices, hear what they were saying.  
DOCTOR: So, an idiot then.  
(Chang turns off the recording.)  
CLARA: Shut up, Doctor.  
CHANG: What I'm about to play you will change your life and not for the
better. These are the three words which caused Doctor Skarosa to set up
institutes, like this one, all over the world, to protect the dead. If you'd
rather not hear these words, there's still time  
DOCTOR: Can you just hurry up, please, or I'll hit you with my shoe.  
VOICE [OC]: Don't cremate me. Don't cremate me!  
CHANG: There is one simple, horrible possibility that has never occurred to
anyone throughout human history.  
VOICE [OC]: Don't cremate me. Don't cremate me!  
CLARA: Don't say it.  
CHANG: The dead remain conscious. The dead are fully aware of everything that
is happening to them.

**[Balcony]**  

SEB: So your mind is here. Your soul, whatever you want to call it. And you're
in your new body in your new world, but you're still connected to your old
body in the old world. You're still going to feel what it feels.  
DANNY: That's why I'm cold.  
SEB: They're keeping you in a cold place, yeah. You did say you were being
cremated?  
(Seb's tablet beeps.)  
SEB: Sorry, I'll get this.  
DANNY: Sorry. Sorry, are you telling me  
SEB: Wow! Oh, that's rare. This never happens.  
DANNY: Wow, what now? What never happens?  
SEB: You've got a call.  
DANNY: A call.  
SEB: From the other side.  
DANNY: Meaning?  
SEB: Do you know somebody called Clara Oswald?  

**[Chang's office]**  

DOCTOR: Fakery. All of it. It's a con, it's a racket!  
CHANG: I promise you this is not a con.  
CLARA: What's that beeping?

**[Gallery]**  

DOCTOR [OC]: Never mind about beeping. Who cares about beeping? The dead are
dead. 'They're not talking to you out of your television sets. They're just
gone  
(Missy claps her hands, and the skeletons all stand up.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: And all these poor souls down there in these tanks, I'm sorry,
but they're just dead and they're not coming back.  

**[Chang's office]  
**

(Chang manipulates a device.)  
DANNY [OC]: Clara? Clara? Clara, are you there?  
CLARA: Danny! I can hear you. Is that you?  

**[Balcony]  
**

CLARA [OC]: Oh, please, say it's you.  
DANNY: That's her, that's Clara!  
SEB: Yeah, you're really lucky. It hardly ever happens.  
(The connection is audio only on Seb's tablet, then the signal drops out.)  
DANNY: Where did she go?  

**[Chang's office]**  

CHANG: Just lost the signal. But I can track it back, I'm pretty sure.  
CLARA: I don't, I don't understand. What is happening?  
CHANG: We've been scanning you telepathically since you came in. You said you
wanted to speak to someone who'd passed, and we've found you a match in the
Nethersphere.  
DOCTOR: This isn't possible. The dead don't come back.  
(Behind him, the skeleton in the tank stands up.)  

**[Balcony]**  

DANNY: Come on, get her back.  
SEB: Da-da-da. I'm trying.  

**[Chang's office]**  

CLARA: It was him. It was his voice.  
DOCTOR: If they scanned you telepathically, they could've lifted a voice
print. It could still be a fake.  
CHANG: Getting him back, very nearly!  

**[Balcony]**  

(The signal is back at 99%.)  
DANNY: Clara, can you hear me?  

**[Chang's office]**  

CLARA: Yes, Danny, I can hear you. Can you hear me?  
DANNY [OC]: Yeah, yeah, I can hear you.  

**[Balcony]**  

DANNY: Clara! Oh, God. Clara  
CLARA [OC]: What do I do?  
DANNY: Who are you talking to?  

**[Chang's office]**  

CLARA: Hang on just a moment.  
DOCTOR: Question him. Ask him questions only he'd know the answer to. Be sure.
You, with me.  
CLARA: Where are you going?  
DOCTOR: I've got to check out those tanks. There's something that I'm missing.  
DANNY [OC]: 'Clara?  
DOCTOR: Sceptical and critical, remember? Be strong, even if it breaks your
heart.  
CHANG: Connection's stabilised. It should be okay.  
DOCTOR: Who would harvest dead bodies? I feel like I'm missing something
obvious.  
(As he walks out through the double doors with windows cut out in the shape of
the logo, but symmetrical. Almost like eyes.)  
CLARA: Danny?

**[Balcony]**  

DANNY: Yeah, I'm here.

**[Chang's office]**  

CLARA: Danny, I'm so sorry but I'm going to have to ask you some questions.  
DANNY: Questions? I swear on anything it's me!

**[Gallery]**  

(Missy snaps her fingers.)  
MISSY: Humankind, bring out your dead.  
(The standing skeletons turn and press a button on the wall of their tanks,
activating something. The liquid starts to drain from the tanks. The Doctor
and Chang enter.)  
CHANG: Oh, my God. The tanks The tanks are activating! They're not supposed to
do that.  
DOCTOR: And all your dead people are standing. Don't you think you skipped the
headline?  
MISSY: Now, now, children. Naughty, naughty.  
DOCTOR: Doctor Chang, your welcome droid has developed a fault.  
CHANG: That's not a droid. That's my boss.  
MISSY: You know, I might have been guilty of a just teensy little fibette.
Doctorr Chang, I really liked working with you. I've enjoyed every day of it.  
CHANG: I'm sorry?  
MISSY: You know, I've even got a little photograph of you looking so sweet.
I'm always going to keep it. Always!  
CHANG: Are you going to kill me?  
MISSY: Now, come on. Let's not dwell on horrid things. This is going to be our
last conversation, and I'm the one who's going to have to live with that.  
CHANG: Please don't kill me.  
MISSY: Say something nice.  
CHANG: Please, please. I don't, I don't want to die. You're going to kill me,
aren't you?  
MISSY: Say something nice.  
CHANG: Please!  
MISSY: Doctor Chang, I've got all day. And I'm not going to kill you until you
say something nice.  
CHANG: It has been an absolute pleasure working with you, and I truly believe
that you'll never be able to find it in your heart to murder me.  
(Missy holds up a device that fires a heat ray, which incinerates Chang
instantly. The Doctor backs away.)  
MISSY: Now, I'll be with you in a moment. Just feeling a bit emotional at the
moment.  
(The Doctor looks up at a tank and sees the water level dropping below the top
of a skeleton's head, to reveal a silver metal helmet.)  
DOCTOR: Cybermen!  

**[Balcony]**  

DANNY: It's me. I, I swear on anything it's me.  
CLARA [OC]: The very first restaurant you took me to. That first date. What
was it called?  
DANNY: Clara, it's me.  

**[Chang's office]**  

CLARA: Then what was the name of the restaurant? What was it?

**[Balcony]**  

DANNY: I can't remember!  

**[Gallery]**  

DOCTOR: They're Cybermen, all of them. We've got to stop them getting out.  
MISSY: Now who's missing the headline? The Nethersphere. You know it's ever so
funny, the people that live inside that think they've gone to heaven.  
(The Doctor looks up at the globe.)  
CLARA [OC]: My birthday. When is it?

**[Balcony]**  

DANNY: November twenty third. That's right, isn't it? I got that one right.  
CLARA [OC]: It's pretty basic information. 'Anyone could know that. Say
something only you could say.

**[Chang's office]**  

CLARA: Tell me something only Danny would know.  

**[Gallery]**  

DOCTOR: That's a matrix data-slice. A Gallifreyan hard drive. Time Lord
technology.  
MISSY: Imagine you could upload dying minds to that. Edit them. Rearrange
them. Get rid of all those boring emotions. Ready to be re-downloaded.
Meanwhile, you upgrade the bodies.  
Upload the mind, upgrade the body. Cybermen from cyberspace. Now, why has no-
one ever thought of that before?  
DOCTOR: How did you get hold of Time Lord technology? Who are you?  
MISSY: You know who I am. I told you. You felt it. Surely you did.  
DOCTOR: Two hearts.  
MISSY: And both of them yours.  
DOCTOR: You're a Time Lord.  
MISSY: Time Lady, please, I'm old-fashioned.  
DOCTOR: Which Time Lady?  
MISSY: The one you abandoned, Doctor. The one you left for dead. Didn't you
ever think I'd find my way back?  
DOCTOR: Clara. Clara. Clara. I've got to get Clara!  
(The Doctor runs to the lift door.)  
MISSY: Oh, Clara, Clara, Clara! You know I should shoot you in a jealous rage.
Now, wouldn't that be sexy? I've turned the lift off, though.  
DOCTOR: I presume you have stairs.  
MISSY: Well, I'm not a Dalek.  
(The Doctor sonicks open the door to the stairs and runs out to -)

**[Outside St Paul's Cathedral]**  

MISSY: Oh, dear, Doctor. Didn't you realise where you were?  
(Church bells peal as the look down Ludgate Hill. A number 56 bus drives
past.)

**[Chang's office]**  

DANNY [OC]: I love you.  
CLARA: No. No, no, no. I'm sorry, but no. Anybody could say that. Anybody
would know to say that. Say something only you could tell me. Prove to me you
are really Danny.  

**[Balcony]**  

DANNY: How?  
CLARA: I love you means nothing right now.

**[Chang's office]**  

CLARA: Not until I know who's talking. Say something only Danny could say.  

**[Balcony]**  

DANNY: Clara  
CLARA [OC]: Danny, if that is you

**[Chang's office]**  

CLARA: Wherever you are  

**[Balcony]**  

CLARA: Whatever it takes, I will be with you again, I swear.  
DANNY: No, you won't. You are not coming here.  
CLARA [OC]: Nothing will stop me,  

**[Chang's office]**  

CLARA: Nothing in the world, as soon as I know it's you.  
DANNY: There is only one way  

**[Balcony]**  

DANNY: To come here, and you are not doing that.  
CLARA [OC]: I'll do anything, Danny, anything. Just say something only you
could say.  
DANNY: Clara, you have your life. You have your whole life to live. You have
to stay there.  
CLARA [OC]: No. I have to be with Danny Pink.  
DANNY: I love you.  

**[Chang's offfice]**  

CLARA: Stop saying that! Don't say that. If you say that again, I swear I will
switch this thing off.  

**[Balcony]**  

DANNY: Clara  
CLARA [OC]: Yes?  
DANNY: I love you.  
(Clara turns off Chang's computer. Danny sits down and cries. Seb takes back
the tablet and calls up another app.)  
SEB: These emotions, they're terribly difficult. But, you know, we've got a
thing for that. We can help with all these difficult feelings. Just press
this.  
(On the screen, next to the name Danny Pink, is a button marked Delete.)  
SEB: I'll leave you to make a decision.

**[Chang's office]**  

(Clara turns around to see the Cyberman who, according to the name plaque, is
Dr Skarosa. She runs to the door.)  
CLARA: Doctor!  
(The doors to the now empty tanks swing open. Shame, I was hoping they'd smash
their way out like they did from their  Tomb. The Cybermen step out and stomp
away.)

**[St Peter's Hill]**  

(The Doctor runs down the steps towards the river.)  
DOCTOR: Get away from here! All of you, run!  
(The Cybermen stomp out of the Cathedral. Ah, memories of The Invasion.)  
DOCTOR: Go! Go! Get away from here! Run away! Run, run! Get away from here all
of you, now!  
MISSY: I'm sorry, everyone. Another ranting Scotsman in the street. I had no
idea there was a match on.  
DOCTOR: Get away, go!  
MISSY: Stop shouting, love. Stop making a fuss. It's too late. All the graves
of planet Earth are about to give birth. You know the key strategic weakness
of the human race? The dead outnumber the living.  
DOCTOR: Who are you?  
MISSY: Oh, you know who I am. I'm Missy.  
DOCTOR: Who's Missy?  
MISSY: Please, try to keep up. Short for Mistress. Well, I couldn't very well
keep calling myself the Master, now could I?  
(The Doctor backs away, horrified. The Cybermen continue their march. Danny
sobs then pulls his finger away from the Delete button.)
