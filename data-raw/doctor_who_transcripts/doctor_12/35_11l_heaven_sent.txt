**Heaven Sent**  
  
Original Airdate: 28 Nov 2015  

DOCTOR [OC]: As you come into this world, something else is also born.  
(Large cogwheels turn. We journey around a large stone building with leaded
windows, narrow corridors, spiral staircases up tall towers, grills covering
sets of large cogwheels set into the stonework, and every few yards screens
hang on the walls, full of static.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: You begin your life, and it begins a journey towards you. It
moves slowly, but it never stops. Wherever you go, whatever path you take, it
will follow. Never faster, never slower, always coming. You will run. It will
walk. You will rest. It will not. One day, you will linger in the same place
too long. You will sit too still or sleep too deep, and when, too late, you
rise to go, you will notice a second shadow next to yours. Your life will then
be over.  
  
**[Teleport chamber room]**  
  
(In a large room containing a teleport (note- not a transmat) chamber and its
separate control console, a blackened hand reaches for a lever, squeezes the
grip to release it, and pulls. The owner of the hand gasps and falls, cogs
turn, and the hand turns to dust. Light fills the teleport chamber and the
Doctor appears, coughing and gasping. The machinery slows and stops. He opens
the curved perspex door of the teleport chamber and steps out, closing it
behind him. He remembers the moment the Quantum Shade raven entered Clara's
body, then scoops a handful of sand from the floor and lets it trickle though
his fingers.)  
DOCTOR: If you think because she is dead, I am weak, then you understand very
little. If you were any part of killing her, and you're not afraid, then you
understand nothing at all. So, for your own sake, understand this. I am the
Doctor. I'm coming to find you, and I will never, ever stop.  
  
**[Tower]**  
  
(The Doctor cautiously leaves the room and goes anticlockwise along a curved
corridor with deep square openings cut in the outer wall to admit light. He
leans out of one to see the shadows of spokes cast on the ground far below.
Then he looks up at the outside of a tall tower.)  
DOCTOR: The equipment in that room is consistent with an augmented ultra long-
range teleport. So, I'm not more than a single light year from where I was,
and I'm in the same time zone.  
(He looks up out of another opening at the sky then across a courtyard at more
towers. Then he starts to walk back clockwise.)  
DOCTOR: When the sun sets, I'll be able to establish an exact position by the
stars. Then you'll have a choice. Come out, show yourself, or keep on hiding.
Clara said I shouldn't take revenge. You should know, I don't always listen.  
(He finds a spade with soil on it leaning against the inner wall.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, what's this? Well, are you gardeners? I hate gardening! What sort
of a person has a power complex about flowers? It's dictatorship for
inadequates. Or to put it another way, it's dictatorship. Come on! Chop, chop!
The Doctor will see you now! Show me what you've got! I just watched my best
friend die in agony. My day can't get any worse. Let's see what we can do
about yours!  
(A black and white circular image forms on the screens. It is a view of him,
from someone looking through a narrow slit in a wall. He looks out of the
nearest opening at the wall across the courtyard. It has narrow slit openings,
and there is a figure in pale grey veils standing at one of them, presumable
the Veil of the cast list. He backs away and checks the view on the nearest
screen. The hunchbacked figure turns away from the slit and moves along the
corridor. According to the screens, the being moves slowly, as if it is
dragging a leg. Each step is a thump, and they get closer. The Doctor wafts
away a fly, then retreats from the approaching sounds. He runs down a narrow
corridor to a wooden door, but it is locked. He is about to run back, but the
being is at the other end of the bridge.)  
DOCTOR: I know you. I've seen you before.  
(He runs back to the door and puts both hands on it.)  
DOCTOR: I used to know a trick, back when I was young and telepathic. Clearly,
you can't make an actual psychic link with a door, for one very obvious
reason. They're notoriously cross. I mean, imagine life as a door. People keep
pushing past you. All of that knocking, but it's never for you. And you get
locked up every night, so if you're just a little bit nice.  
(The door unlocks.)  
DOCTOR: See, Clara? Still got it.  
(He opens the door to reveal a solid wall just a pace behind it. The Veil has
almost arrived.)  
DOCTOR: But I. Er, I can't actually see a way out of this I've finally run out
of corridor. There's a life summed up. Oh, now this is new. I'm scared. I just
realised that I'm actually scared of dying.  
(The Veil has arrived, and is just reaching out with its four-fingered hands,
when it stops dead, with a clang.)  
DOCTOR: Something I said? What did I say?  
(Even the Veil's attendant flies are frozen in the air. He flicks one away.)  
DOCTOR: Why did you stop?  
(There is a loud cracking and rumbling of cogs. He looks out of an opening to
see a sections of the walls rotating in opposite directions with the uppermost
faster than the lower ones, rather like the upper section of the Tardis time
rotor does nowadays. The obstructing wall moves aside and he runs into the
revealed room.)  
  
**[Bedroom]**  
  
(The cogs stop. The Doctor tests the springs in the bed then picks one of the
stems of hemerocallis from a vase by the window and sniffs it. Then he sees a
portrait hanging over the fireplace, it's paint and varnish old and cracked
and peeling. It is, of course, a painting of Clara Oswald. He picks up a
jeweller's eyeglass that is conveniently by the frame and examines the state
of the oils, not noticing that the screen in the room shows him examining the
painting. The Veil is arriving.)  
DOCTOR: Old. Very old. Possibly very, very old.  
(Then he sees a fly land on the portrait. He drops the glass from his eye and
turns to face the Veil.)  
DOCTOR: When I was a very little boy, there was an old lady who died. (cheek
pop) They covered her in veils, but it was a hot, sunny day, and the flies
came. It gave me nightmares for years. So, who's been stealing my nightmares?  
(He plucks petals from the flowers.)  
DOCTOR: What am I here for? You've known about me for a very long time, right?  
(He puts the eyeglass back in and dodges around to see if the Veil can
actually see him.)  
DOCTOR: So, what is it? Is it a trap? Is it a prison? No! Is it a torture
chamber? Am I right? Somebody really should know better. Anyone who can put
all of this together and steal my bad dreams, they should know better.  
(He lets the jeweller's eyeglass fall to the floor with a metallic clatter.)  
DOCTOR: The secrets I have? No chance. No telling, not me.  
(He ducks under the veiled being's arms and grabs a wooden stool to fend it
off.)  
DOCTOR; I told you I was scared of dying. And I wasn't lying either.
Advantage, me!  
(He throws the stool through a leaded window. The wind is blowing.)  
DOCTOR: Because you won't see _this_ coming!  
(The Doctor dives through the broken window...)  
  
**[Tardis]**  
  
(And bursts in through the doors. He goes to the console, pushing the scanner
screen aside and working controls. We get intercut shots of him plummeting
ever downwards.)  
DOCTOR: Sorry I'm late. Jumped out of a window. Certain death. Don't you want
to know how I survived? Go on. Ask me! No, of course I had to jump! The first
rule of being interrogated is that you are the only irreplaceable person in
the torture chamber. The room is yours, so work it. If they're going to
threaten you with death, show them who's boss. Die faster. And you've seen me
do that more often than most. Isn't that right, Clara? Rule one of dying,
don't. Rule two, slow down.  
(The Doctor slows to almost no movement in mid-fall. There is a figure in the
Tardis with her back to him.)  
DOCTOR: You've got the rest of your life. The faster you think, the slower it
will pass. Concentrate. Assume you're going to survive. Always assume that.
Imagine you've already survived. There's a storm room in your mind. Lock the
door and think. This is my storm room. I always imagine that I'm back in my
Tardis, showing off, telling you how I escaped, making you laugh. That's what
I'm doing right now. I am falling, Clara. I'm dying. And I am going to explain
to you how I survived. I can't wait to hear what I say. I'm nothing without an
audience. One hope. Salt.  
(The stool smashes the window.)  
DOCTOR: Thought I smelled it earlier. When I broke the window, I was sure.
Salty air. This castle is standing in the sea.  
(A schematic is on the scanner.)  
DOCTOR: Diving into water from a great height is no guarantee of survival. I
need to know exactly how far I'm going to fall, and how fast.  
(Calculations are scrolling up the scanner as the top of the time rotor
turns.)  
DOCTOR: Why do you think I threw the stool? (breaking glass) Fall time to
impact (splash) seven seconds.  
DOCTOR [bedroom]: Because you won't see this coming!  
DOCTOR: The wind resistance of the stool, the atmospheric density, (the petals
falling) the strength of the local gravity. (the fall of the jeweller's
glass.) Am I spoiling the magic? I work at this stuff, you know? Should hit
the water in about  
(The Doctor stretches out his arms into a dive.)  
DOCTOR: Point zero two seconds. The chances of remaining conscious are  
(Splash! The Doctor enters the water and gently floats downwards. The Tardis
has gone dark, then lights up again, roundel layer by roundel layer. Someone
is writing on a blackboard with chalk.)  
BLACKBOARD: Question 1. What is this place?  
DOCTOR: Can't I just sleep?  
BLACKBOARD: Question 2. What did you say that made the creature stop?  
DOCTOR: Do I have to know everything?  
BLACKBOARD: How are you going to  
DOCTOR: Clara, I can't always  
BLACKBOARD: Win?? (with seven underlines.)  
  
(Filtered sunlight reveals that the sea bed is covered in long humanoid
skulls. Fully conscious again, the Doctor swims up to the surface and gasps
for breath. A short time later he has climbed out. The castle has a central
tower with four spokes coming off it on two levels, connecting to the outer
circular wall. From above it looks rather like a cog wheel.  
Dripping wet, he walks up a staircase into a room with a roaring log fire.
There are a pair of boots in front of the hearth, and trousers, jacket,
waistcoat, shirt all on a wooden clothes horse to the side. The Doctor warms
himself briefly, then compares the cuff buttons on the dry jacket with his
own. They are identical. He exchanges his wet clothes for the dry ones. After
a brief pause he puts his wet garments back exactly where he found the dry
ones, and stands both boots up.  
From the drying room, he walks through the great hall - of Caerphilly Castle -
with a dining table set for one in the middle and on into a...  
  
**[Storeroom]**  
  
(This storeroom with a hexagon shaped hole in the flagstones, and chalked
arrows pointing in towards each side. He touches the sand in the bottom of
it.)  
DOCTOR: It keeps coming, Clara. Wherever I go, it follows. Why? Why does it do
that?  
BLACKBOARD: Wrong question.  
DOCTOR: Always the teacher. What's the right question, then?  
BLACKBOARD: Not why. What?  
DOCTOR: It's following me. Wherever I go, it's tracking me. Slowly though.
Scary lurching. Scary. These screens, everywhere. It's showing me exactly
where it is all the time, how far it's got, how near. Because it's _trying_ to
scare me. Putting its breath on my neck. That's the point. That's what it's
doing. This is theatre. It's all about fear. Working hypothesis. I'm in a
fully automated haunted house. A mechanical maze.  
(A copper pan hanging up rattles.)  
DOCTOR: It's a killer puzzle box designed to scare me to death, and I'm
trapped inside it. (laughs) Must be Christmas.  
(Heavy doors open somewhere. The Doctor walks out into a dark corridor. Water
drips somewhere. He opens a creaky door into -)  
  
**[Gard** **en** **]**  
  
(The trees and shrubs look nearly dead in the near permanent shade of the tiny
inner courtyard. The door slams shut behind him, making him jump. A bell is
ringing somewhere. The garden is laid out with a cogwheel design to the paths.
At the centre is an empty round bed with a recently dug rectangle in the
middle, like a screwdriver slot. The Doctor feels the quality of the worked
soil, then sees a clean spade leaning against the wall.)  
DOCTOR: Another spade? Someone wants me to dig. What do you think, Clara? Is
someone trying to give me a hint? What would you do?  
BLACKBOARD: Same as you.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, of course you would.  
(He takes the spade.)  
DOCTOR: Which, let's be honest, is what killed you. So, someone is trying to
tell me that there's something important buried in this garden. That's almost
the first thing they tried to tell me. Could be a trick. Could be one of my
predecessors. Because I'm not the first prisoner here, am I! All those skulls!
Wonder where they all went wrong. Building this height, creature that slow, so
what? An hour.  
(He excavates the dug soil as the Veil and its attendant flies come closer.
When one buzzes his face, he runs to a window to check the screen inside. It
is a view of a piece of wood with flies on it. So he opens the door, and the
Veil is there, screeching at him. The Doctor slams the door, trapping its
hands, until it finally withdraws them. He jams the spade under the door
handle, digging its blade into the gravel path.)  
DOCTOR: Physics of a triangle. You lose.  
(The door stops shaking and the Veil leaves.)  
DOCTOR: So? It can set traps. That's okay. I'm good at traps.  
(Nervously he checks the view on the screen. It is the storeroom with its
hexagon in the floor.)  
DOCTOR: So, where are you off to? Only one way in and one way out. Well,
seeing as you're going.  
(He retrieves the spade, jumps back into the hole and carries on digging. As
night falls and crickets chirp, he is about four foot down and tired, so he
pauses to look up at the dark sky.)  
DOCTOR: No, no. That's not right.  
(The spade hits something. Sounds like stone by the scrape. He uses his hands
to clear the remaining soil so he can read what has been carved into it. I Am.
He recalls the hexagon. Flies start to buzz as he uncovers. In 12. A fly
buzzes in front of him, then the Veil jumps down into the grave-sized hole.
The Doctor falls backwards as it reaches for him.)  
  
**[Tardis]**  
  
DOCTOR: Well, that was another close one. Or it will have been, once I've been
and gone and got myself out of it. So, how am I going to do that? Come on,
teacher, ask me questions!  
(The back of the woman moves aside to reveal what she has written on the
blackboard.)  
BLACKBOARD: Tell no lies.  
DOCTOR [tower]: I'm actually scared of dying.  
BLACKBOARD: Question 2. What did you say that made the creature stop?  
DOCTOR: The truth, yes. But not any old truth, Clara. This whole place is
designed to terrify me. I'm being interrogated. It's not just truth it wants.
That's not enough. It's confession. I have to tell truths I've never told
before. That's the only thing that stops it. You see, the problem is, Clara,
there are truths that I can never tell. Not for anything. But I'm scared and
I'm alone. Alone, and very, very scared.  
(He sits on the steps to the gallery.)  
DOCTOR: I confess.  
  
**[Garde** **n** **]**  
  
DOCTOR: I didn't leave Gallifrey because I was bored! That was a lie! It's
always been a lie!  
(The Veil pauses.)  
DOCTOR: Not enough? You want more? I was scared! I ran because I was scared!
Is that what you want me to say? Is that true enough for you?  
(The Veil withdraws its hand, the castle rumbles. The Doctor climbs out of the
grave to see the various floors rotating in opposite directions again. He runs
inside then through to the wall on the outside of the castle, and looks out
across the endless sea. A pair of skulls are dislodged from the seabed and
float to the surface. The castle stops moving and they drift back down again.)  
  
**[Bedroom]**  
  
(A clock ticks, but it is actually the Doctor tapping a finger against the arm
of his chair.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: It's funny, the day you lose someone isn't the worst. At least
you've got something to do. It's all the days they stay dead.  
(The flies arrive.)  
DOCTOR: Fifty seven minutes?  
(He gets up and leaves just ahead of the Veil's arrival. )  
  
(Tapping the bannister of a big staircase.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: This is how my world works, Clara. I tick off the seconds as they
pass. My life is a countdown.  
(A door thuds. He runs down and through a long gallery to another big room.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: If I draw the creature to one extreme of the castle, and I run to
the other extreme, I can earn myself a maximum of eighty two minutes. Eighty
two minutes to eat, sleep and work. My work is finding Room 12. (He goes
through door 46) The castle wants me to. It's luring me. (He checks his
notebook.) The numbering is a bit confused, (backs away from door 7) as if the
rooms are all jumbled up. Maybe they move around. I saw the whole castle move,
when I made the creature stop.  
(Back in the garden, the grave is filled in again.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Every room, if I leave it long enough, reverts to its condition
at the moment I arrive. It tidies up after itself.  
(The flowers are in the bedroom vase, intact. He remembers plucking the
petals.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Automated room service.  
(He has a meal in the Great Hall, soup served in a pewter dish, which he eats
with a pewter spoon. A metal goblet and a plate of bread rolls are also on the
fabric place mat.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: I think this whole place is inside a closed energy loop,
constantly recycling. Or maybe I'm in Hell? That's okay. I'm not scared of
Hell. It's just Heaven for bad people. But how long will I have to be here?
Forever?  
(He lets the spoon drop. From a corridor above the Great Hall he sees the Veil
near the table.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: It's always coming. Always closer. The countdown never stops. But
the countdown to what?  
  
**[Teleport chamber room]**  
  
DOCTOR [OC]: There are two events in everybody's life that nobody remembers.
Two moments experienced by every living thing, yet no one remembers anything
about them. Nobody remembers being born and nobody remembers dying.  
(He finds a skull with power leads attached to its temples on the floor by the
control console, and picks it up. Alas, poor Yorick.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Is that why we always stare into the eye sockets of a skull?  
(He removes the power leads and stands.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Because we're asking, what was it like? Does it hurt? Are you
still scared?  
(He sees a word written in the sand or dust.)  
DOCTOR: Bird? What's bird got to do with it? Are there birds here?  
(The cogs start turning and the word disappears. A piece of wall slides away
to reveal the entrance to a spiral staircase.)  
  
**[Tower]**  
  
(The Doctor climbs the steps to the battlements at the top of the tower, and
places Yorick in a crenellation overlooking the sea.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: There's something I'm missing, Clara, and I think it's something
terrible.  
(He looks up at the stars. Back inside the tower, he hears a door open and
close, and heads down some steps to find a door labelled 12. He opens it, but
the way into the room beyond is blocked by masonry. Light streams through the
gap on the left hand side.)  
DOCTOR: Hello? Hello, is there someone there? Hello!  
DOCTOR [OC]: It's a trap, Clara. A lure and a trap.  
(The Doctor's head morphs into Yorick up on the battlements and he looks at
the stars again.)  
DOCTOR: I'm following breadcrumbs laid out for me. This is somebody's game,
and I can't stop playing. A game everybody else has lost. I know how to move
that wall, Clara, so long as I don't run out of confessions. But what I really
want to know is  
(Flies buzz.)  
DOCTOR: Who's been playing about with the stars? They're all in the wrong
places, for this time zone, anyway. I _know_ I didn't time travel to get here.
I can _feel_ __time travel.  
(The Veil is coming up behind him.)  
DOCTOR: If I didn't know better, I'd say I've travelled seven thousand years
into the future. But I do know better. So who moved the stars?  
(The Veil reaches its hands either side of his face.)  
DOCTOR: The Hybrid.  
(The Veil pauses and he turns around to face it.)  
DOCTOR: Long before the Time War, the Time Lords knew it was coming, like a
storm on the wind. There were many prophecies and stories, legends before the
fact. One of them was about a creature called the Hybrid. Half Dalek, half
Time Lord, the ultimate warrior. But whose side would it be on? Would it bring
peace or destruction? Was it real, or a fantasy? I confess, I know the Hybrid
is real. I know where it is, and what it is. I confess, I'm afraid.  
(The Veil leaves and the castle reconfigures. The rumbling shakes Yorick off
the battlements and it plummets into the sea to join all the other identical
skulls.)  
  
**[Room 12]**  
  
(The Doctor runs back down the stairs and opens the doors. The masonry
blocking the way has gone. As he enters, he slaps his fingers against his palm
to count the seconds. The Veil is coming. The Doctor walks down the smooth
narrow passage and puts his sonic sunglasses on. He takes them off when he
reaches the wall of crystal at the far end with the word Home carved in it.
But the word disappears after a few moments. A dark rectangular shape can just
be made out through the crystal.)  
DOCTOR: Of course. The last square on the board. What else would it be? The
Tardis. One confession away.  
(He puts the sunglasses back on.)  
DOCTOR: Azbantium. Four hundred times harder than diamond. Twenty feet thick.
The way out.  
(He remembers the word in the dust in the teleport chamber room.)  
DOCTOR: Bird?  
  
**[Tardis]**  
  
DOCTOR: (angry) That's when I remember! Always then. Always then. Always
_exactly_ __then! I can't keep doing this, Clara! I can't! Why is it always
me? Why is it never anybody else's turn?  
BLACKBOARD: How are you going to win?? (seven underlines.)  
DOCTOR: Can't I just lose? Just this once?  
(He hides under the time rotor assembly.)  
DOCTOR; Easy. It would be easy. It would be _so_ __easy. Just tell them. Just
tell them, whoever wants to know, all about the Hybrid.  
(The Doctor is sitting on the ground in a channel cut part way through the
Azbantium, as the Veil arrives in room 12. In the Tardis, in his head, he
comes out and runs around the console room.)  
DOCTOR: I can't keep doing this. I can't! I can't always do this! It's not
fair! Clara, it's just not fair! Why can't I just lose?  
BLACKBOARD: No!  
DOCTOR: But I can remember, Clara.You don't understand, I can remember it all.
Every time. And you'll still be gone. Whatever I do, you still won't be there.  
(He sits on the stairs to the lower level, distraught.)  
CLARA [OC]: Doctor, you are not the only person who ever lost someone. It's
the story of everybody. Get over it. Beat it. Break free.  
(Her hand touches his cheek.)  
CLARA: Doctor, it's time. Get up, off your arse, and win!  
  
**[Room 12]**  
  
(The Doctor stands to face the Veil as it enters the room.)  
DOCTOR; Hello again. No more confessions, sorry. But I will tell you the
truth.  
(The Doctor punches the Azbantium wall, and cries out in pain.)  
DOCTOR: The Hybrid is a very dangerous secret. A very, very dangerous secret
and it needs to be kept!  
(Another punch, another cry of pain.)  
DOCTOR: So I'm telling you nothing. Nothing at all. Instead, I'm going to do
something far worse. (punch) Argh! I'm going to get out of here, and find
whoever put me here in the first place, and whatever they're trying to do, I'm
going to stop it! (punch) Argh!  
(The Doctor doubles over in pain.)  
DOCTOR: But it might take me a little while, so do you want me to tell you a
story? (punch) Argh! The Brothers Grimm, lovely fellas. They're on my darts
team. (punch) Argh! According to them, there's this emperor and he asks this
shepherd's boy, how many seconds in eternity?  
(The Veil's scaly hands close across the Doctor's eyes and he screams as steam
rises from his skin then falls to the ground. The Veil is teleported away and
the screens revert to static. Silence reigns.)  
  
**[Tardis]**  
  
The Doctor's storm room slowly lights up.)  
DOCTOR: People always get it wrong with Time Lords. We take forever to die.
Even if we're too injured to regenerate, every cell in our bodies keeps
trying. Dying properly can take days. That's why we like to die among our own
kind. They know not to bury us early.  
(The mortally injured Doctor drags himself up a spiral staircase.)  
DOCTOR: I think, in my current condition, it'll take me about a day and a half
to reach the top of the tower. I think. If I'm lucky, I have a day and a half.  
(The Doctor drags himself along a corridor, leaving smears of blood behind.)  
DOCTOR: I have to do this, Clara. It's the only way. I have to be strong. I
should have known from the very beginning. Of course. The portrait of you, the
creature from my own nightmares. This place is my own bespoke torture chamber,
intended for me only. And all those skulls in the water. How could there be
other prisoners in my Hell? The answer, of course, is there never were any
other prisoners. And the stars, they weren't in the wrong place, and I haven't
time travelled.  
(He collapses onto the floor of the Tardis as he actually reaches the teleport
chamber room.)  
DOCTOR: I've just been here a very, very long time. Every room resets.
Remember I told you that? Every room reverts to its original condition.
Logically, the teleporter should do the same. Teleporter. Fancy word. Just
like 3D printers, really, except they break down living matter and
information, and transmit it. All you have to do is add energy. The room has
reset, returned to its original condition when I arrived. That means there's a
copy of me still in the hard drive. Me, exactly as I was, when I first got
here, seven thousand years ago. All I have to find is some energy.  
(He picks up the power cables and attaches them to his temples.)  
DOCTOR: And all you need for energy is something to burn.  
(It is the dying Doctor who takes hold of the lever and pulls it down, sending
power into the transporter console. When he finally falls to the ground, the
cogs turn, the teleporter powers up, and he writes Bird in the dust with his
last ounce of strength.  
DOCTOR: How long can I keep doing this, Clara? Burning the old me, to make a
new one?  
(The Tardis goes dark. The burnt hand turns to dust. The bloodstains on the
flagstones disappear. We are back to the start of the show.)  
  
**[Teleport chamber room]**  
  
(The Doctor gasps and coughs in the teleport chamber. The cogs stop turning
and he gets out, closing the door behind him before scooping up dust and
letting it run through his fingers.)  
DOCTOR: If you think because she's dead, I am weak, then you understand very
little. If you were any part of killing her and you're not afraid, then you
understand nothing at all. So, for your own sake, understand this. I'm the
Doctor. I'm coming to find you, and I will never, ever stop.  
  
(After he leaves the room, the camera sweeps across the word Bird to the skull
with power leads attached. Then the Doctor is throwing the stool through the
window.)  
DOCTOR [bedroom]: Because you won't see _this_ __coming!  
(He dives into the sea and sees all the skulls. He exchanges his wet clothes
for the dry set and excavates the grave again. He picks up Yorick and ends up
on the top of the tower with the Veil behind him.)  
DOCTOR: If I didn't know better, I'd say I've travelled seven thousand years
into the future.  
(Yorick falls into the sea, the Doctor opens the door to room 12 and punches a
few more molecules off the Azbantium wall.)  
DOCTOR: Aah! How many seconds in eternity?  
(He crawls back to the teleport to do it all again.)  
DOCTOR [tower]: If I didn't know better, I'd say I've travelled twelve
thousand years into the future.  
DOCTOR [room 12]: How many seconds in eternity? And the shepherd's boy Argh!  
(And again.)  
DOCTOR [tower]: Six hundred thousand years into the future.  
DOCTOR [room 12]: Argh! How many seconds in eternity? And the shepherd's boy
says Argh!  
(Digging again, dropping the spoon in the soup.)  
DOCTOR [tower]: Twelve hundred thousand years into the future.  
DOCTOR [room 12]: Argh! And the shepherd's boy says Argh!  
DOCTOR [tower]: Two million years into the future.  
DOCTOR [room 12]: And the shepherd's boy says  
(And again, and again, and again, getting dizzy with the flashing excerpts...)  
DOCTOR [tower]: Twenty million years into the future.  
DOCTOR [room 12]: Ow! And the shepherd's boy says, there's this mountain of
pure diamond. It takes an hour to climb it, and an hour to go around it!  
(Even faster flashes of scenes.)  
DOCTOR [tower]: 52 million years.  
DOCTOR [room 12]: Every hundred years, a little bird comes and sharpens its
beak on the diamond mountain.  
(Faster still.)  
DOCTOR [tower]: Nearly a billion years.  
DOCTOR [room 12]: Argh! And when the entire mountain is chiselled away, the
first second of eternity will have passed!  
(Faster still.)  
DOCTOR [tower]: Well over a billion years.  
DOCTOR [room 12]: Argh! You must think that's a hell of a long time,  
(More and more.)  
DOCTOR [tower]: Two billion years.  
DOCTOR [room 12]: Personally, I think that's a hell of a

(The Doctor charges the remaining layer of crystal at the end of the twenty
foot tunnel.)  
DOCTOR: Aaargh!  
(The Azbantium finally gives way. Bright light floods in and the Veil
explodes, cogwheels and shrouds falling to the floor.)  
DOCTOR: Personally, I think that's a hell of a bird.  
  
**[Planet surface]**  
  
(The Doctor walks out of the portal created by the hole in the Azbantium onto
a dry planet with a golden sky. The portal closes and a small round metal
object falls to the ground. The Doctor picks up a miniature of the castle
surrounded by blue water. Brass cogwheels fill the space and then an engraved
cover closes over it. It is his confession dial. A small boy runs up to him.)  
DOCTOR: Go to the city. Find somebody important. Tell them I'm back. Tell
them, I know what they did, and I'm on my way. And if they ask you who I am,
tell them I came the long way round.  
(The boy runs off towards a tall metallic city with a towering Citadel at its
heart. The Doctor speaks to his confession dial.)  
DOCTOR: You can probably still hear me, so just between ourselves, you've got
the prophecy wrong. The Hybrid is not half Dalek. Nothing is half Dalek. The
Daleks would never allow that. The Hybrid destined to conquer Gallifrey and

(The Doctor dons his sonic sunglasses.)  
DOCTOR: Is me.
