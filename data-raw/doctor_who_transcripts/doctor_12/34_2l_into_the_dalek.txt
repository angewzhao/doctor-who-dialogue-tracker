**Into the Dalek**  
  
Original Airdate: 30 Aug 2014  

**[Fighter]  
  
**(A small space fighter is dodging weapons fire and asteroids. It's female
pilot has an injured co-pilot.)  
JOURNEY: Aristotle, this is Wasp Delta, do you hear me? Stay with me, Kai.
Stay with me, please. Aristotle! We have been hit. Major damage. Aristotle!  
(Her enemy is a massive flying saucer.)  
JOURNEY: Aristotle! The enemy are right on top of us.  
(The fighter is hit.)  
JOURNEY: I'm sorry.  
  
**[Saucer]  
  
**DALEK: Exterminate.  
(A second laser pulse finds its mark. The little fighter explodes as Journey
screams.)  
  
**[Tardis]  
  
**(Journey opens her eyes to see the brass handles of the console. She sees
the Doctor and scrambles for her hand gun, and keeps it pointing at him.)  
DOCTOR: You'll probably feel a bit sick. Please, don't be.  
(The Doctor is holding a card tray with two takeaway coffees in it.)  
JOURNEY: Where's my brother?  
DOCTOR: Hello, I'm the Doctor.  
JOURNEY: He was right beside me. Where's Kai? How did I get here?  
DOCTOR: I materialised a time capsule exactly round you and saved your life
one second before your ship exploded, but do please keep crying.  
JOURNEY: My brother's just died.  
DOCTOR: His sister didn't. You're very welcome. Put the gun down.  
JOURNEY: Or what?  
DOCTOR: Or you might shoot me. Then where will you be?  
JOURNEY: In charge of your vessel.  
DOCTOR: You'd starve to death trying to find the light switch. Who are you?  
JOURNEY: I'm Lieutenant Journey Blue of the Combined Galactic Resistance. I
demand you take me back to my command ship, the Aristotle, which is currently
located  
DOCTOR: No. Hey, not like that.  
JOURNEY: You will take me back to my command ship, which is currently
positioned  
DOCTOR: No, no. Come on. Not like that. Not like that. Get it right  
(Journey lowers her gun.)  
JOURNEY: Will you take me back to my ship? Please?  
DOCTOR: The Aristotle's the big fella parked in the asteroid belt, yeah?  
(The Doctor sets the Tardis moving.)  
JOURNEY: It's shielded.  
DOCTOR: More or less.  
(The Aristotle is hiding by one edge of a long thin asteroid. Journey opens
the Tardis door.)  
DOCTOR **:** Dry your eyes, Journey Blue. Crying's for civilians. It's how we
communicate with you lot.  
  
**[Med Sec 07]  
  
**(The Tardis has neatly parked herself in a corner of a large section. There
are pieces of metal debris and a soldier is driving a small buggy in the
background.)  
JOURNEY: It's smaller on the outside.  
DOCTOR: It's a bit more exciting when you go the other way. This isn't a
battleship. Medical insignia. It's a hospital.  
(An older man with a greying beard speaks. He is backed up by armed soldiers.)  
MORGAN: We don't need hospitals now. The Daleks don't leave any wounded, and
we don't take any prisoners.  
DOCTOR: I saved your little friend here, if that's in any way relevant to
mention.  
JOURNEY: That's true, sir. He did.  
MORGAN: Thank you.  
DOCTOR: You're welcome. I wish I could've done more.  
MORGAN: Then you should have.  
DOCTOR: Okay.  
MORGAN: But you did save Journey, and for that I am personally grateful.  
DOCTOR: Well  
MORGAN: However, the security of this base is absolute. So we're still going
to kill you.  
DOCTOR: Oh, it's a roller coaster with you, isn't it?  
MORGAN: Shoot him, bag him and throw him outside.  
JOURNEY: No! Stop!  
MORGAN: I'm sorry. He might be a duplicate.  
JOURNEY: He's a doctor. And we have a patient, don't we, Uncle?  
  
**[Corridor]**  
  
DOCTOR: Why does a hospital need a doctor?  
MORGAN: The Aristotle wasn't always hidden. The Daleks got here before us.  
JOURNEY: You don't like soldiers much, do you?  
DOCTOR: You don't need to be liked. You've got all the guns.  
  
**[Lab 01]  
**  
(The soldiers stand guard at door 078.)  
DOCTOR: Wow! A moleculon nanoscaler.  
(A large clear tube with bench seats down the inside. A bit like a
decompression chamber for divers.)  
JOURNEY: You know what it does, then?  
DOCTOR: It miniaturises living matter. What's the medical application, though?
Do you use it to shrink the surgeons so they can climb inside the patients?  
MORGAN: Exactly.  
DOCTOR: Fantastic idea for a movie. Terrible idea for a proctologist. Are you
going to miniaturise me?  
MORGAN: You're a doctor, aren't you?  
(He opens a pair of secure doors further along.)  
MORGAN: And this is your patient.  
(A scratched eyepiece glows blue.)  
DOCTOR: No, you don't understand. You can't put me in there.  
RUSTY: Doctor?  
(This is a battered 2005 style Dalek with various cables going into its dome.)  
  
**[Coal Hill school playground]**

(A short haired, dark-skinned man with a neatly trimmed short beard shouts in
the playground.)  
DANNY: Atten-shun. Look at you lot. I've never seen such a miserable bunch.
What are you, children?  
FLEMING: Yes, sir.  
(Danny and his troop are wearing matching t-shirts.)  
DANNY: You think you're funny, Fleming?  
FLEMING: Yes, sir.  
DANNY: All right, me too.  
(The school bell rings.)  
DANNY: Dismissed.  
(The members of the Coal Hill Cadet Corps run off to the school building.)  
BOY: What you doing, Fleming?  
(Clara smiles at Danny and follows the children inside.)  

**[Secretary's office]  
**  
(A little later, Danny enters, now dressed in shirt and tie, to check the
timetable on the notice board for any changes.)  
SECRETARY: So, Mister Pink, did you have a good weekend?  
DANNY: Yeah, I did, thanks.  
SECRETARY: Yeah, I'll bet you did. What did you get up to?  
DANNY: Er, you know. A bit of reading.  
SECRETARY: Oh, I bet you were reading.  
DANNY: I was, yeah.  
SECRETARY: Yeah, I bet you were.  
DANNY: Well, yeah, I was.  
SECRETARY: I know your type.  
(A schoolgirl is listening at the public counter.)  
COURTNEY: She wishes.  
SECRETARY: Be quiet, you.  

**[Maths classroom]  
**

DANNY: So that's all the questions on page 32, except the last one, and then
everything on page 33. All that in for Thursday. Any questions?  
FLEMING: Sir? Have you ever killed a man?  
(Groans from the rest of the class.)  
DANNY: I was a soldier. There were other soldiers and some of them weren't on
our side. I shall leave the rest to your imagination. And, please, think of
another question?  
FLEMING: Okay. Have you ever killed anyone who wasn't a soldier?  
DANNY: Just to repeat, that's all the questions on page 32, except the last
one, and then everything on page 33. All that in for Thursday. Is everyone
clear?  
CLASS: Yes, sir.  
(The class watch a lone tear roll down Danny's cheek.)  

**[Staff room]  
**  
(The staff are putting on their coats to leave. Clara is discussing timetables
with the headmaster.)  
CLARA: Fine, I'll take that class and then, they can do some of the test.  
ARMITAGE: I know. Oh, Clara, you've not met Danny Pink yet? New fella, maths.
Danny? Clara Oswald.  
CLARA: Hey.  
ARMITAGE: English.  
DANNY: Hey, nice to meet you.  
CLARA: You too.  
ARMITAGE: Want to watch yourself around him. Bit of a lady-killer, but always
denies it.  
DANNY: I am not a lady-killer.  
ARMITAGE: See what I mean? Oh, Beth, can I have a word?  
BETH [OC]: Yeah, yeah, sure.  
CLARA: Er, was it you that I saw outside doing the soldiery thing?  
DANNY: Ah yeah, probably. The Coal Hill Cadets. Just a bit of fun.  
CLARA: What, teaching them how to shoot people?  
DANNY: There's a bit more to modern soldiering than just shooting people. I
like to think there's a moral dimension.  
CLARA: Ah, you shoot people then cry about it afterwards?  
DANNY: Ah.  
CLARA: Something wrong?  
DANNY: Nothing, no. Sorry, no, nothing. I just. I didn't think they'd say
anything, that's all.  
CLARA: Sorry?  
DANNY: Have they told everyone?  
CLARA: No, no, no. As far as I know, nobody has told anybody anything. What
are you talking about?  
DANNY: Why did you just say the crying thing?  
CLARA: I was being funny.  
DANNY: Why?  
CLARA: I just do that.  
DANNY: Why?  
CLARA: I don't know.  
DANNY: Anyway I, er, I've left some stuff in my class.  
CLARA: Okay, see you.  
DANNY: See you.  
CLARA: Er, are you going to the, er, leaving thing tonight for Cathy?  
DANNY: Um.  

**[Maths classroom]  
**

DANNY: Yeah. I wasn't going, but I am now, because you're going to be there,
and suddenly it seems like the best idea ever.  

**[Staff room]  
**  
DANNY: No, I'm not.  
CLARA: Oh, okay, never mind.  
DANNY: Good night.  
CLARA: Change your mind.  
DANNY: Excuse me?  
CLARA: I'm going. Er, I'll give you a lift. Why not?

**[Maths classroom]  
**  
DANNY: Actually, now that you mention it, seems like the best plan ever. Thank
you.  

**[Staff room]  
**  
DANNY: No, I've got some reading.  
CLARA: Ah, okay. Maybe some other time, then?  

**[Maths classroom]  
**

DANNY: Thank you!  
(He bangs his forehead on his desk.)  
CLARA: Ahem. Is the wooden sound you or or the desk?  
DANNY: How long have you been there?  
CLARA: Longer than you would like.  
DANNY: Okay.  
CLARA: Are you going to look that terrified when you take me out for a drink?  
DANNY: I, I absolutely promise I won't.  
CLARA: Play your cards right and you might.  

**[Supply cupboard]  
**  
(Clara enters, and nearly walks into the tray of coffees that the Doctor is
holding out to her. The Tardis just fits the width of the back of the
cupboard.)  
CLARA: Where the hell have you been?  
DOCTOR: You sent me for coffee.  
CLARA: Three weeks ago. In Glasgow.  
DOCTOR: Three weeks, that's a long time.  
CLARA: In Glasgow. That's dead in a ditch.  
DOCTOR: It's not my fault, I got distracted.  
CLARA: By what?  
DOCTOR: You can always find something. Come on.  

**[Tardis]  
**

DOCTOR: Why were you smiling?  
CLARA: Was I? No, I wasn't.  
DOCTOR: You were smiling at nothing. I'd almost say you were in love, but to
be honest  
CLARA: Honest?  
DOCTOR: You're not a young woman any more.  
CLARA: Yes, I am.  
(Clara takes the coffees and puts them on the console.)  
DOCTOR: Well, you don't look it.  
CLARA: I do look it.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's right, keep your spirits up, Clara, Clara, Clara, Clara.
Clara, Clara. Clara, Clara. I need something from you. I need the truth.  
CLARA: Okay. Right, what is it? What's  
(They sit on the console steps.)  
CLARA: You're scared.  
DOCTOR: I'm terrified.  
CLARA: Of what?  
DOCTOR: The answer to my next question, which must be honest and cold and
considered, without kindness or restraint. Clara, be my pal and tell me, am I
a good man?  
CLARA: I don't know.  
DOCTOR: Neither do I.  
(He gets up and goes to the console.)  
CLARA: Er, hey, no offence, but I've got plans.  
DOCTOR: I need you.  
CLARA: Right. Where are we going?  
(He starts the Tardis flying.)  
DOCTOR: Into darkness.  

**[Rusty's room]  
**  
RUSTY: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: How do you know who I am?  
MORGAN: He doesn't. We promised him medical assistance.  
RUSTY: Are you my doctor?  
JOURNEY: We found it floating in space.  
MORGAN: We thought it was deactivated, so we tried to disassemble it.  
DOCTOR: You didn't realise there was a living creature inside.  
JOURNEY: Not till it started screaming.  
RUSTY: Help me.  
DOCTOR: Why would I do that? Why would any living creature help you?  
RUSTY: Daleks will die.  
DOCTOR: Die all you like. Not my problem.  
RUSTY: Daleks must be destroyed.  
DOCTOR: Daleks must be de. What did you just say?  
RUSTY: All Daleks must die. I will destroy the Daleks. Destroy the Daleks.
Destroy the Daleks!  

**[Tardis]  
**  
(Drinking her coffee.)  
CLARA: A good Dalek?  
DOCTOR: There's no such thing.  
CLARA: That's a bit inflexible. Not like you. I'd almost say prejudiced.  
DOCTOR: (sigh) Do I pay you? I should give you a raise.  
(The Tardis lands.)  
CLARA: You're not my boss, you're one of my hobbies.  
DOCTOR: Come on.  

**[Lab 01]  
**

JOURNEY: That was quick.  
DOCTOR: This is gun girl. She's got a gun, and she's a girl. This is a sort of
boss one. Are you the same one as before?  
MORGAN: Yes.  
DOCTOR: I think he's probably her uncle, but I may have made that up to pass
the time while they were talking. This is Clara, not my assistant. She's, er,
some other word.  
CLARA: I'm his carer.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, my carer. She cares so I don't have to.  

**[Rusty's room]  
**

RUSTY: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Hello again.  
RUSTY: Will you help me?  
CLARA: Will you?  
DOCTOR: A Dalek so damaged, it's turned good. Morality as malfunction. How do
I resist?  
RUSTY: Daleks must die. Daleks must die.  
CLARA: So, what do we do with a moral Dalek, then?  
DOCTOR: We get into its head.  
CLARA: Mmm. How do you get into a Dalek's head?  
DOCTOR: That wasn't a metaphor.

**[Lab 01]  
**

(They go to the moleculon nanoscaler.)  
JOURNEY: These are nanocontrollers. Once we're miniaturised, they take over
the molecular compression. When the mission's over, hit the button.  
(Journey puts the bracelet on Clara's wrist.)  
JOURNEY: Are you sure you understand?  
CLARA: Why wouldn't I?  
JOURNEY: Because this is a dangerous mission and you look like a school
teacher.  
CLARA: I am a school teacher. Still didn't catch your name.  
JOURNEY: Journey Blue.  
CLARA: Blue?  
JOURNEY: Blue, yes. Problem?  
CLARA: No. Er, I just met a soldier called Pink.  
JOURNEY: Lucky fella.  
CLARA: Lucky?  
JOURNEY: From the way you smile.  
CLARA: So, er, who makes you smile or is nobody up to the job?  
JOURNEY: My brother. But he burned to death a couple of hours ago, so he's
really letting me down today. Excuse me.  
DOCTOR: What are those ones for? I don't need armed baby-sitters.  
GRETCHEN: We're not baby-sitters.  
ROSS: We're here to shoot you dead if you turn out to be a Dalek spy.  
DOCTOR: Well, that's a relief. I hate baby-sitters.  
JOURNEY: Okay, listen up. Now, remember, do not hold your breath when the
nanoscaler engages. You'll feel like you want to, but you must keep breathing
normally during the miniaturisation process.  
CLARA: Why?  
DOCTOR: Ever microwaved a lasagne without pricking the film on top?  
CLARA: It explodes.  
DOCTOR: Don't be lasagne.  
MORGAN: Nanoscaler engaging in five four three two. Nanoscaler engaging now.  
COMPUTER: Nanoscaling in progress.  
(A crossbeam passes back and forth over chamber id AR-O13-AR-F74 until it
shrinks with a bump.)  
COMPUTER: Nanoscaling complete.  
MORGAN: Nanoscaling successful. Everyone okay in there?  
(The chamber is carefully picked up with a pair of tweezers.)  
JOURNEY [OC]: We made it.  

**[Nanoscaler]  
**

JOURNEY: Nobody popped.  
CLARA: Whoa. Ha. I can't believe this.  
DOCTOR: No, neither can I.  
(The chamber is injected into Rusty's eye-piece. The Doctor reaches out and
the surface wibbles.)  

**[Lab 01]  
**  
MORGAN: We'll be following you all the way, Rescue One. Good luck all of you.  
(The Doctor's arm distorts as he slowly reaches into the blue 'eye' on the end
of the stalk. Then they all push their way through.)  
COMPUTER: Integration complete. Dalek levels steady.  

**[Eye stalk]  
**

CLARA: That was weird.  
DOCTOR: You've seen nothing yet.  
CLARA: What are the lights?  
DOCTOR: Visual impulses travelling towards the brain.  
CLARA: Beautiful.  
DOCTOR: Welcome to the most dangerous place in the universe.  

**[Lab 01]  
**  
(The computer is monitoring their locations inside Rusty.)  
JOURNEY [OC]: Entering the cranial ledge now.  

**[Cranial ledge]  
**  
JOURNEY: Here.  
CLARA: Oh, my God.  
(They look down from the ledge onto the red tentacled blob that is the organic
part of Rusty. Should really be green, but times have obviously changed.
Cables run down into it.)  
DOCTOR: Behold, the belly of the beast.  
CLARA: It's amazing.  
ROSS: It's huge.  
GRETCHEN: No, Ross. We're tiny.  
CLARA: So how big is it, that living part, compared to me and you, right now?  
DOCTOR: You see all those cables?  
CLARA: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: They're not all cables.  
ROSS: Does it know we're here?  
JOURNEY: It's what invited us in.  
(The Doctor looks at banks of vertical lights around the inside of part of the
ledge.)  
DOCTOR: Now, this is the cortex vault, a supplementary electronic brain.
Memory banks, but more than that. This is what keeps the Dalek pure.  
GRETCHEN: How are Daleks pure?  
DOCTOR: Dalek mutants are born hating. This is what stokes the fire,
extinguishes even the tiniest glimmer of kindness or compassion. Imagine the
worst possible thing in the universe, then don't bother, because you're
looking at it right now. This is evil refined as engineering.  
RUSTY [OC]: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Oh, hello, Rusty. You don't mind if I call you Rusty? We're going to
need to come down there with you. Medical examination, and all that.  
GRETCHEN: What, with those tentacles and things?  
JOURNEY: How close do we have to get?  
DOCTOR: Well, you know, we're never going to insert a thermometer from up
here.  
(Journey nods, and Ross fires a harpoon into Rusty's ledge. It hurts him. )  
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no! Stop, stop, stop, you idiot!  
(Another harpoon goes in.)  
JOURNEY: We need a way down, the only way  
DOCTOR: This is a Dalek, not a machine. It's a perfect analogue of a living
being, and you just hurt it. So what's going to happen now?  
CLARA: Oh, God.  
GRETCHEN: What? What is it?  
CLARA: Antibodies?  
DOCTOR: Dalek antibodies.  
(Little round objects fly into view.)  
DOCTOR: Nobody move Any attempt to help him, or attack those things, will
identify you as a secondary source of infection. Stay still!  
(The antibodies open to reveal a big blue eye, then surround Ross.)  
CLARA: But the Dalek wants us in here. Why is it attacking?  
DOCTOR: Can you control your antibodies?  
JOURNEY: Ross, stay calm. We're going to get you out of this.  
CLARA: Can you?  
DOCTOR: Ross, swallow that.  
ROSS: What is it?  
DOCTOR: Trust me.  
(Ross swallows the little whatever it was that the Doctor threw to him.)  
ROSS: Now what?  
(An antibody aims a painful bright beam at him.)  
JOURNEY: Ross!  
(Ross disintegrates.)  
CLARA: Oh, my God. What's it doing?  
(The antibody sucks up the remains and its blue eye turns red,)  
DOCTOR: The hoovering.  
(The antibody flies away. The Doctor raises his sonic screwdriver.)  
DOCTOR: Gotcha.  
CLARA: What did you give him?  
DOCTOR: Oh, just a spare power cell, but I can track the radiation signature.
I need to know where they dump the bodies.  
JOURNEY: I thought you were saving him.  
DOCTOR: He was dead already. I was saving us. Follow me and run.  
CLARA: Run!  
(The other antibodies follow at a distance. The Doctor stops at a hole in the
ledge.)  
DOCTOR: They've dumped him in here. Organic refuse disposal. We need to get in
there.  
CLARA: Why?  
(Gretchen and Journey shoot at the antibodies.)  
DOCTOR: Those antibodies won't give up until we're inside there. I'd rather go
in alive than dead.  
JOURNEY: You don't know where it goes.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. Away from here. Now in. In! In!  
(Clara jumps down the hole.)  
GRETCHEN: I can hold them off.  
DOCTOR: No, you can't.  
(He tries his screwdriver on the antibodies.)  
DOCTOR: Pull back. Down. Jump, everyone, jump.  
(The Doctor goes in last, and enjoys the ride.)  

**[Organic refuse disposal]  
**

(They splosh into liquid gunk. Shades of Star Wars episode IV.)  
CLARA: Urgh. What is this stuff?  
DOCTOR: People. The Daleks need protein. Occasionally, they harvest from their
victims. This is a feeding tube.  
JOURNEY: Is Ross here?  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Top layer, if you want to say a few words.  
(Journey pushes the Doctor against the wall.)  
JOURNEY: A man has just died. You will not talk like that.  
DOCTOR: A lot of people have died. Everything in here is dead, and do you know
why that's good?  
JOURNEY: There is nothing good about that.  
DOCTOR: Nothing is alive in here, so logically this is the weakest spot in the
Dalek's internal security. Nobody guards the dead. Mortuaries and larders,
always the easiest to break out of. Oh, I've lived a life Tell Uncle Stupid
that we're in. Ah ha! A bolt hole.  
(The Doctor unscrews the large bolt with the sonic screwdriver.)  
CLARA: He'll get us out of here. The difficult part is not killing him before
he can.  
DOCTOR: Bolt hole. Actually, a hole for a bolt. Does nobody get that?  
CLARA: Also, there's the puns.  
DOCTOR: Watch it, decontamination tubes are hot.  

**[Lab 01]  
**  
(The schematic on the screen shows our heroes' Nanotags are just over half way
down Rusty's innards, below where he is sitting by the plunger and gun arms.)  
COMPUTER: Anomaly threat displaced. Dalek levels returning to normal
parameters.  
JOURNEY [OC]: Rescue One to Mission Control.  
MORGAN: This is Blue, Rescue One. Report.  

**[Decontamination tube]  
**  
JOURNEY:The Dalek has an internal defence mechanism.  

**[Lab 01]  
**

JOURNEY [OC]: We've lost Ross.  
MORGAN: What kind of defence mechanism?  

**[Decontamination tube]  
**

MORGAN [OC]: That thing knows you're in there to help it.  
JOURNEY: Yeah, well, who knows? It's a Dalek. We're going to continue the
mission.  
DOCTOR: Are you all right back there? It's a bit narrow, isn't it?  
CLARA: Any remarks about my hips will not be appreciated.  
DOCTOR: Ach, your hips are fine. You're built like a man.  
CLARA: (sotto) Thanks.  

**[Power unit]  
**

(The Doctor helps Clara down from the tube.)  
DOCTOR: What's that noise? Are you wearing a Geiger counter?  
GRETCHEN: Standard battle equipment. That's just low level radiation.  
(There are large printed circuit boards here.)  
DOCTOR: But stronger down here, for some reason. Gimme.  
MORGAN [OC]: Was that him?  

**[Lab 01]  
**  
MORGAN: How's he working out?  
JOURNEY [OC]: It's hard to say.  

**[Power unit]**  

JOURNEY: He's  
(The Doctor sweeps the circuit boards with the Geiger counter.)  
DOCTOR: I've got it. I know what's wrong with Rusty.  
CLARA: Okay, that's good. Is that good?  
DOCTOR: Well, you know how I said this was the most dangerous place in the
universe? I was wrong. It's way more dangerous than that.  

**[Lab 01]  
**  
JOURNEY [OC]: Colonel, we have radiation indicators red-lining in here. Could
be that the Dalek is badly damaged than we thought.  
MORGAN: Copy that.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Old Rusty here is suffering a trionic radiation leak.  

**[Power unit]  
**

DOCTOR: It's poisoning the Dalek and us. Just as well we're here.  
JOURNEY: Really? Perhaps we should get out while we can. Why should we trust a
Dalek? Why would it change?

**[Organic compartment]  
**  
(Rusty is watching them on an internal monitor.)  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Good question. Rusty? What changed you?  
RUSTY: I saw beauty.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: You saw what?  
RUSTY: In the silence and the cold, I saw worlds burning.  
JOURNEY [on screen]: That's not beauty, that's destruction.  
RUSTY: I saw  

**[Power unit]  
**

RUSTY [OC]: More.  
DOCTOR: What? What did you see?  
RUSTY [OC]: The birth of a star.  
DOCTOR: Stars are born every day. You've seen a million stars born. So what?  
RUSTY [OC]: Daleks have destroyed a million stars.  

**[Organic compartment]  
**

DOCTOR [on screen]: Oh, millions and millions. Trust me, I keep count.  
RUSTY: And yet, new stars are born.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Every time.  

**[Power unit]  
**

RUSTY [OC]: Resistance is futile.  
DOCTOR: Resistance to what?  
RUSTY [OC]: Life returns. Life prevails. Resistance is futile.  
DOCTOR : So you saw a star being born, and you learned something. Oh, Dalek,
do not be lying to me. Come on.  

**[Lab 01]  
**

JOURNEY [OC]: Heading for the Trionic power cells, Colonel.  
MORGAN: Radiation approxing two hundred Rads. Danger levels.  
COMPUTER: Radiation levels increasing.  

**[Power cell]  
**

(Directly underneath Rusty.)  
DOCTOR: We're at the heart of the Dalek.  
CLARA: It's incredible.  
(Energy arcs above them.)  
JOURNEY: Geiger counter's off the scale. Looks like it's about to blow.  
DOCTOR: Good.  
JOURNEY: How is that good?  
DOCTOR: Well, I like a bit of pressure. Rusty, can you hear me?  
RUSTY [OC]: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Rusty, we've found the damage. I'm sealing up the breach in your power
cell.  
(He uses the sonic screwdriver as a welder.)  
DOCTOR: No more radiation poisoning. Good as new. There. Job done.  
CLARA: That's it? Just like that?  
DOCTOR: An anti-climax once in a while is good for my hearts. Rusty? How do
you feel? Rusty? Rusty? Rusty.  
RUSTY [OC]: The malfunction is corrected.  
JOURNEY: What's happened?  
DOCTOR: Not entirely sure.  
(Lights come on.)  
JOURNEY: It's like it's waking up.  
DOCTOR: Rusty, come on, talk to me. What's going on?  
RUSTY [OC]: The malfunction is corrected. All systems are functioning.  

**[Rusty's room]  
**

RUSTY: Weapons charged.  

**[Power cell]  
**

DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no.  

**[Rusty's room]**  

RUSTY: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
(Rusty kills the man keeping watch through the window in his cell door. It is
a return to the classic black and white skeleton effect as the victim dies.
Rusty breaks free and Morgan sounds the alarm.)  

**[Power cell]  
**

DOCTOR: No, no, no,  
RUSTY [OC]: Exterminate.  

**[Lab 01]  
**

RUSTY: Exterminate.  

**[Power cell]  
**

(The team are thrown about as Rusty moves.)  
RUSTY [OC]: The Daleks will be victorious The rebels will be exterminated.  
JOURNEY: Colonel? What's happening out there?  

**[Lab 01]  
**

(Morgan and his troops are too busy shooting at Rusty.)  
RUSTY: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.
Exterminate.  
(Two more soldiers die.)  
RUSTY: Exterminate. (and another) Exterminate.  
MORGAN: Pull back, pull back.  
(Rusty plugs into a console with his plunger arm.)  
RUSTY: Dalek fleet. Communications open.  

**[Saucer]  
**

DALEK: The rebel ship has been identified.  
DALEK 2: Prepare fourteen Daleks.  

**[Power cell]**  

CLARA: Doctor, what happened?  
DOCTOR: Do you see?  
CLARA: Do I see what?  
DOCTOR: Daleks don't turn good. It was just radiation affecting its brain
chemistry, nothing more than that. No miracle.  
JOURNEY: Let me get this straight. We had a good Dalek, and we made it bad
again? That's all we've done?  
DOCTOR: There was never a good Dalek. There was a broken Dalek and we repaired
it.  
JOURNEY: You were supposed to be helping us.  
DOCTOR: I gave it a shot. It didn't work out. It was a Dalek, what did you
expect?  
JOURNEY: No more talking. You are done! Okay, new objective. We are taking
this Dalek down.  
RUSTY [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
DOCTOR: What's that look for?  
CLARA: It's the look you get when I'm about to slap you.  
(And she does. Hard.)  
DOCTOR: Ow. Clara.  
CLARA: Are we going to die in here? I mean, there's a little bit of you that's
pleased. The Daleks are evil after all. Everything makes sense. The Doctor is
right.  
DOCTOR: Daleks are evil. Irreversibly so. That's what we just learned.  
CLARA: No, Doctor, that is not what we just learned.  

**[Aristotle]  
**

RUSTY [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
MORGAN: Secure the door! Wasp fighters to action stations. Wasp fighters to
action stations.  
SOLDIER [OC]: The security systems have been hacked. We don't have access to
the Wasps.  
MORGAN: Then God save us all.  

**[Power cell]  
**

JOURNEY: We need to place these charges for maximum effect. I'm going to scan
the rest of the architecture for weaknesses.  
CLARA: One question.  
JOURNEY: No time.  
(Journey and Gretchen place grenades on handy surfaces.)  
CLARA: Why did we come here today? What was the point? You. You thought there
was a good Dalek. What difference would one good Dalek make?  
DOCTOR: All the difference in the universe, but it's impossible.  
CLARA: Is that a fact? Is that really what we've learned today? Think about
it. Is that what we've learned?  

**[Aristotle]  
**

MORGAN: Journey, what the hell's happening? That thing's set the Daleks on us.  

**[Power cell]  
**

MORGAN [OC]: And it's locked us out of our defences.  

**[Aristotle]  
**

MORGAN: Journey, you're the Aristotle's only hope.  

**[Power cell]  
**

MORGAN [OC]: I need you to destroy that Dalek.  

**[Aristotle]  
**

RUSTY: The rebels will be exterminated.  
MORGAN: Whatever it takes.  

**[Power cell]  
**

JOURNEY: Understood, Uncle.  

**[Aristotle]  
**

MORGAN: I'm sorry.  

**[Power cell]  
**

JOURNEY: Yeah. Me too.  
DOCTOR: Clara Oswald, do I really not pay you?  
CLARA: You couldn't afford me.  
DOCTOR: Whatever you're going to do, don't do it This Dalek must not be
destroyed. We can do better.  
JOURNEY: Are you out of your mind?  
DOCTOR: No, I'm inside a Dalek. I'm standing where I've never been. We cannot
waste this chance. It won't come again.  
JOURNEY: What chance? I have my orders.  
DOCTOR: Soldiers take orders.  
JOURNEY: And I'm a soldier.  
DOCTOR: A Dalek is a better soldier than you will ever be. You can't win this
way.  
(Journey holds up a grenade to pull the pin, then puts it down again.)  
JOURNEY: Bah! So what do we do?  
DOCTOR: Something better.  

**[Saucer]  
**

DALEK: Prepare to board the rebel ship. We must find our comrade Dalek. Spare
no humans. Exterminate them all.  
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.  
(The Saucer flies over the asteroid where the Aristotle is hiding.)  

**[Inner casing]  
**

(They climb up to a recess.)  
DOCTOR: The Dalek isn't just some angry blob in a Dalekanium tank. If it was,
the radiation would have turned it into a raging lunatic.  
JOURNEY: It is a raging lunatic, it's a Dalek.  
DOCTOR: But for a moment, it wasn't. The radiation allowed it to expand its
consciousness, to consider things beyond its natural terms of reference. It
became good. That means a good Dalek is possible. That's what we learned
today. Am I right, teach?  
CLARA: Top of the class.  
JOURNEY: But now it's back to how it was.  
DOCTOR: But what it saw, what it felt, is still there.  
JOURNEY: Yeah, I'm not really seeing that.  
DOCTOR: Not here. There.  
(He points upwards.)  
JOURNEY: You mean in the cortex vault?  
CLARA: The evil engineering?  
DOCTOR: Every memory recorded. Some suppressed, but all still intact. We need
to show the Dalek that star being born again. Recreate that moment. You need
to get up there, find that moment and reawaken it.  
CLARA: Me?  
DOCTOR: Yes, you. Good idea.  
CLARA: How?  
DOCTOR: Haven't the foggiest. Do a clever thing. And then once you've done it,
the Dalek will be suggestible to new ideas. It will be open again. And I will
show it something that will change its mind forever  
JOURNEY: What? Not a clue.  

**[Aristotle docking port]  
**

DALEK [OC]: Docking initiated.  
(The space doors are blown in.)  
DALEK [OC]: Pressures equalised. Boarding corp, begin attack.  
DALEK 2: Advance. Exterminate the humans.  
DALEKS: Seek, locate, destroy. Surrender is not accepted.  
(Note - as they come through the burning spacedoors, some of the rubber
plungers catch fire.)  

**[Inner casing]  
**

JOURNEY: This is crazy. There is no way that we can get back up there in time.  
GRETCHEN: Yes, there is.  
JOURNEY: No, Gretchen. It'll bring the antibodies back down on us.  
GRETCHEN: Tell me the truth. Is he mad, or is he right? I've come this far.
Probably going to die anyway. Wouldn't mind something to do for the rest of my
life. Is he mad, or is he right? CLARA: Hand on my heart? Most days he's both.  
GRETCHEN: One question, then. Is this worth it?  
DOCTOR: If I can turn one Dalek, I can turn them all. I can save the future.  
GRETCHEN: Gretchen Alison Carlisle. Do something good and name it after me.  
DOCTOR: I will do something amazing, I promise.  
GRETCHEN: Damn well better.  
(Gretchen primes her harpoon.)  
JOURNEY: No, Gretchen.  
(She fires two wires up to the cranial ledge.)  
GRETCHEN: Go.  
(Antibodies approach.)  
CLARA: They're coming. They're coming.  
(Journey fastens a pulley onto the zip wire.)  
JOURNEY: Grab hold of the rope. Don't look down.  
GRETCHEN: Good luck.  
(Journey and Clara fly upwards. The Doctor leaves, and Gretchen shoots at the
antibodies until she is killed, screaming.)

**[Tea rooms]**

(And stops screaming when she realises she is still breathing and sitting
down. Gretchen looks at the Edwardian lady seated across the tea table by the
French windows.)  
MISSY: Hello. I'm Missy. Welcome to heaven. Would you like some tea? Little
splosh? Lovely.

**{Aristotle]  
**

MORGAN: Fire!  
DALEK: Exterminate. Advance. Seek, locate, destroy.  
DALEK 2: Seek, locate, destroy.  
DALEK 3: Exterminate.  
(A Dalek goes KaBOOM!)  
DALEK: Advance. Seek, locate.  
DALEK 2: Exterminate. Exterminate.  

**[Organic compartment]  
**

DOCTOR: Well, Rusty, here we are. Eye to eye.  
RUSTY: You cannot save the humans. They will be exterminated.  

**[Lab 01]  
**

RUSTY: I shall join the Dalek units in the final attack.  

**[Cranial ledge]  
**

JOURNEY: So what do we do?  
CLARA: Er, a clever thing, quickly. Think, think, think, think, think. Some of
the lights are out.  
JOURNEY: Yeah, we've got a damaged Dalek. You want to complain to someone?  
CLARA: But it's not damaged, look at them.  
JOURNEY: So?  
CLARA: So, the Doctor said this was a memory bank and some of the memories
were suppressed. What if. What if the dark spots are hidden memories? What if
one of those is the Dalek seeing a star?  
JOURNEY: Seriously?  
CLARA: Yeah. Well, maybe. It's either that or the bulbs need changing.  
JOURNEY: It really could be the bulbs.  
CLARA: Got a better idea?  
JOURNEY: Really wish I had.  
CLARA: Yep, me too. Ah-ha.  
(She pulls one of the panels off.)  
CLARA: Watch out for antibodies. Let's see if there's an on switch.  
(Clara goes behind, into the memory banks.)  

**[Organic compartment]  
**

DOCTOR: I saved your life, Rusty. Now I'm going to go one better. I'm going to
save your soul.  
RUSTY: Daleks do not have souls.  
DOCTOR: Oh, no? Imagine if you did. What then, Rusty? What would happen then?  

**[Cortex vault]  
**

CLARA: I'm in the cortex.  
**  
[Cranial ledge]  
**

JOURNEY: If there's a pack of spare bulbs, break it to me gently.  
(Clara hits a dark panel and there is a flash. Some lights come on. The Doctor
sees the flash travel down neurones to Rusty. Images of dying soldiers are on
the screens.)  

**[Organic compartment]  
**

DOCTOR: Your memories. I'm about to give some back to you.  

**[Cranial ledge]  
**

JOURNEY: Are you okay? Clara?  

**[Cortex vault]  
**

CLARA: Yeah. I think there was some sort of energy charge.  

**[Cranial ledge]  
**

JOURNEY: You got the first lights on.  

**[Cortex vault]  
**

CLARA: Of course, it's a brain. Brains work with electrical pathways linking
up memories. It's working. It's working, we're turning the memories back on.  
(She continues to crawl over flexible tubing.)  

**[Organic compartment]  
**

DOCTOR: See, all those years ago, when I began  
(The Doctor is using his sonic screwdriver to cut through the flexible tubing
covering a set of neurones, then pulls them apart.)  
DOCTOR: I was just running. I called myself the Doctor, but it was just a
name. And then I went to Skaro. And then I met you lot and I understood who I
was. The Doctor was not the Daleks.  

**[Aristotle]  
**

DALEKS: Exterminate.  
MORGAN: Fall back. Follow me. Fall back.  
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.  

**[Cranial ledge]  
**

(Antibodies are rising up through Rusty's body.)  
JOURNEY: You'd better get a move on, There's company coming.  

**[Aristotle]  
**

(Soldiers continue to die as Daleks close in from all corridors.)  
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
MORGAN: Fall back, fall back.  
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate.  
(The soldiers seal a bulkhead door.)  

**[Cranial ledge]  
**

(Journey starts shooting at antibodies.)  
JOURNEY: Hurry up!  

**[Cortex vault]  
**  
CLARA: Show me a star, Rusty.  
(More lights come back on.)  

**[Organic compartment]  
**

(Impulses flow down the cables to Rusty. These images are of Daleks flying in
space, attacking the Valiant in Stolen Earth.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, look. It's your memories again. It's like somebody's mucking about
up there. Memories, all those memories. Do you remember the star you saw being
born?  

**[Cortex vault]  
**

CLARA: Almost done. One more to go.  

**[Cranial ledge]  
**

JOURNEY: Hurry up, Clara! Hurry up.  
(The last set of lights come on, and Rusty's eyepiece goes dark. The
antibodies retreat.)  
JOURNEY: Clara, you did it. It's rebooting.  

**[Cortex vault]  
**

JOURNEY [OC]: The antibodies have reset.  

**[Organic compartment]  
**

RUSTY: I, I remember.  
DOCTOR: You saw the truth, Rusty. Remember how you felt. You saw a star being
born. The endless rebirth of the universe.  
RUSTY: No.  
DOCTOR: And you realised the truth about the Daleks  

**[Aristotle]  
**

(Rusty is spinning around.)  
RUSTY: Truth? What is the truth?  

**[Organic compartment]  
**

DOCTOR: Let me show you the truth. I've opened your mind and now I'm coming
in.  

**[Aristotle]  
**

(The Daleks are starting to burn through the bulkhead door.)  
MORGAN: That door is never going to hold. But I'm damned if I'm going to make
it easy for them.  

**[Rusty's mind]  
**

(The Doctor splices the two pieces of cut neurone together with his bare
hands, and screams as the energy surges through his body.)  
DOCTOR: I'm part of you. My mind is in your mind.

**[Lab 01]  
**

RUSTY: I see your mind, Doctor. I see your universe.  

**[Rusty's mind]  
**

DOCTOR: And isn't the universe beautiful?  
RUSTY [OC]: I see beauty.  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. That is good. Hold on to that.  
RUSTY [OC]: I see endless, divine perfection.  
DOCTOR: Make it a part of you. Remember how you feel right now. Put it inside
you and live by it.  
RUSTY [OC]: I see into your soul, Doctor. I see beauty. I see divinity. I see
hatred.  
DOCTOR: Hatred?

**[Lab 01]  
**

RUSTY: I see your hatred of the Daleks and it is good.  

**[Rusty's mind]  
**

(Behind the Doctor, the Crucible explodes.)  
DOCTOR: No, no, no. You must see more than that, there must be more than that.  

**[Lab 01]  
**  
RUSTY: Death to the Daleks.  

**[Rusty's mind]  
**

RUSTY [OC]: Death to the Daleks. Death to the Daleks.  
DOCTOR: No, there must be more than that. There must be more than that.
Please.  

**[Aristotle]  
**

RUSTY: Daleks are evil. Daleks must be exterminated. Daleks are evil.  
(Rusty approaches his former comrades from the rear, while Morgan and his
surviving soldiers prepare for them to break through the bulkhead door.)  
MORGAN: God save us all.  
RUSTY: Daleks must be exterminated.  
(The Daleks turn and Rusty shoots them to pieces.)  
RUSTY: Exterminate.  
DALEK: Under attack from a Dalek!  
(KaBOOMs all round!)  
RUSTY: The Daleks are exterminated  

**[Rusty's mind]  
**

DOCTOR: Of course they are. That's what you do, isn't it?  

**[Aristotle]  
**

(The humans have left Rusty and are normal size again.)  
MORGAN: Journey.  
JOURNEY: Uncle Morgan.  
RUSTY: I have transmitted a retreat signal. The Daleks will believe the humans
have initiated the ship's self-destruct.  
(Journey briefly hugs Morgan.)  
CLARA: What about you, Rusty?  
RUSTY: I must go with them.  
DOCTOR: Of course you must. You've unfinished work, haven't you?  
RUSTY: Victory is yours, but it does not please you.  
DOCTOR: You looked inside me and you saw hatred. That's not victory. Victory
would have been a good Dalek.  
RUSTY: I am not a good Dalek. You are a good Dalek.  
(Rusty turns to leave, then looks back at the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: Till the next time.  
(The Doctor goes through the door to Med Sec 07.)  
JOURNEY: Is he leaving? Isn't he going to say goodbye?  
CLARA: I think that was it. Yep, that was it. Sorry, got to run.  
(Clara goes after the Doctor. Rusty leaves.)  
JOURNEY: I'm sorry.  
(Journey kisses Morgan on the cheek and follows Clara.)  
MORGAN: Sorry?  

**[Med Sec 07]  
**

JOURNEY: Doctor. Take me with you.  
DOCTOR: I think you're probably nice. Underneath it all, I think you're kind
and you're definitely brave. I just wish you hadn't been a soldier.  
(Journey and Clara exchange final sheepish smiles before Clara follows the
Doctor into the Tardis. The Dalek Saucer leaves the asteroid belt.)

**[Tardis]**

(Clara runs up the stairs in new clothes. The Tardis is in flight.)  
CLARA: How do I look?  
DOCTOR: Sort of short and round-ish, but with a good personality, which is the
main thing.  
CLARA: I meant my clothes. I just changed.  
DOCTOR: Oh, good for you, still making an effort.  
(The Tardis lands.)  
DOCTOR: Okay, right, you're back in your cupboard, thirty seconds after you
left.  
CLARA: When will I see you again?  
DOCTOR: Oh. Soon, I expect. Or later. One of those.  
(Clara opens the door.)  
CLARA: I don't know.  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry?  
CLARA: You asked me if you're a good man and the answer is, I don't know. But
I think you try to be and I think that's probably the point.  
DOCTOR: I think you're probably an amazing teacher.  
CLARA: I think I'd better be.  

**[Corridor]  
**

(Clara comes out of the supply cupboard.)  
DANNY: Ah, hey.  
CLARA: Hey, Danny.  
DANNY: Have you changed your clothes?  
CLARA: Yes. Yes, I, I have. Well noticed.  
DANNY: Okay, good.  
CLARA: Yes, good. Very good. Good work. You passed the test.  
DANNY: Are you really going to go for a drink with me?  
CLARA: Yeah, course I am. Why wouldn't I?  
DANNY: I just thought  
CLARA: Thought what?  
DANNY: I thought you might have a rule against soldiers.  
CLARA: No. No, not at all.  
(They go different ways.)  
CLARA: Not me.
