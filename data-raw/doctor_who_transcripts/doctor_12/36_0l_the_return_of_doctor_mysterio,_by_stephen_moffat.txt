**The Return of Doctor Mysterio, by Stephen Moffat**  
  
Original Airdate: 25 Dec 2016  

(We look at a comic book's blank panel that says 'later that night', then down
from the night sky to an American street. A New York yellow cab passes by
Joe's Pizza, then we look up the fire escape and into a young man's window.
Comic books are by the bed, along with his spectacles, and he is dreaming of a
time when -)  

**[Young Grant's bedroom]**  

(The swoosh of a large pendulum outside the window wakes a boy. He coughs.)  
DOCTOR: Hey!  
(Grant puts on his spectacles, turns on his flash light and goes to the window
as the Doctor swings by, upside down.)  
DOCTOR: Hello there! Ah, hello!  
(Grant opens the window.)  
YOUNG GRANT: Hello?  
DOCTOR: Hello!  
YOUNG GRANT: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: I was setting a trap.  
YOUNG GRANT: A trap?  
DOCTOR: On your roof.  
YOUNG GRANT: What happened?  
DOCTOR: I tried it out.  
YOUNG GRANT: How?  
DOCTOR: Accidentally.  
(The Doctor stops swinging. Grant sneezes.)  
DOCTOR: Bless you.  
YOUNG GRANT: Thanks.  
DOCTOR: What's your name?  
YOUNG GRANT: Grant.  
DOCTOR: Hello, Grant. What floor is this?  
YOUNG GRANT: Sixty.  
DOCTOR: Ah!  
(The rope and electrical cable around his ankles begin to part and fray.)  
DOCTOR: Would it all right if I came in?  
YOUNG GRANT: I'll have to ask my mom.  
(Grant shuts the window on the Doctor's fingers.)  
DOCTOR: Ow!  
YOUNG GRANT: Mom, wake up.  
(The Doctor tries to sonic the sash window open, then Grant opens it again.)  
DOCTOR: Oh!  
YOUNG GRANT: Mom says you can come in. You're expected.  
DOCTOR: Expected? Argh!  
(The rope and cable have finally parted. The Doctor heaves himself back up
over the window sill and collapses on the floor. Grant puts a glass of milk
and plate of cookies down for him.)  
DOCTOR: Sorry, did you say I was expected?  
YOUNG GRANT: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: Who did you say I was?  
YOUNG GRANT: I told her I saw an old guy at the window. (sneezes)  
DOCTOR: Ho-ho-ho-ho. Merry Christmas, Grant!  
(He eats a cookie and browses Grant's collection of Superman comics. Grant
returns to his bedroom.)  
YOUNG GRANT: Mom and Dad are asleep now. I can get you back on the roof. I
know the way.  
DOCTOR: Shh.  
YOUNG GRANT: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Take a look at that picture.  
(Clark Kent talking to Mrs Olsen.)  
YOUNG GRANT: Okay.  
DOCTOR: Now this one. (Superman) Take a good, long look. It takes a moment to
see it.  
YOUNG GRANT: See what?  
DOCTOR: Superman and Clark Kent are one and the same person.  
YOUNG GRANT: Are you serious?  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Look, I drew specs on Superman.  
YOUNG GRANT: Everyone knows they're the same person.  
DOCTOR: Well, Lois Lane doesn't, and she's a reporter.  

**[Stairs]**  

DOCTOR: Why did they call him Spider-Man? Don't they like him?  
YOUNG GRANT: He was bitten by a radioactive spider, and guess what happened?  
DOCTOR: Radiation poisoning, I should think.  

**[Roof]**  

YOUNG GRANT: No, he got special powers.  
DOCTOR: What, vomiting, hair loss and death? Fat lot of use. Hey! What do you
think?  
YOUNG GRANT: That looks  
DOCTOR: I know.  
YOUNG GRANT: Cheap.  
(A pile of bits of metal and various styles of television antennae and
satellite dishes.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, shut up! Got a cold there, Grant?  
YOUNG GRANT: I always get a cold at Christmas.  
DOCTOR: Me too. Or an invasion.  
(He hands Grant a glass of water.)  
YOUNG GRANT: Where did you get that from?  
DOCTOR: My pocket.  
YOUNG GRANT: How do you keep a glass of water in your pocket?  
DOCTOR: Skills. Now hush, I've got a lot of work to do. Take this.  
(A small red glowing octahedron.)  
YOUNG GRANT: Who are you?  
DOCTOR: The Doctor.  
YOUNG GRANT: Yeah, but who are you?  
DOCTOR: The Doctor.  
YOUNG GRANT: Which one, though? There's lots of doctors.  
DOCTOR: _The_ one. I'm the main one. The original. I started it. They're all
based on me. Now everyone who wants to sound clever calls themselves Doctor.
Bandwagon!  
YOUNG GRANT: In a comic book, you know what you'd be called? Doctor Mysterio.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I like that. Doctor Mysterio! I'll have that. Nearly ready.  
YOUNG GRANT: What is it?  
DOCTOR: Well, in terms that you would understand? Sorry, there aren't any.
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a time-distortion equaliser thingy.  
YOUNG GRANT: A what?  
DOCTOR: Well, there's been a lot of localised disruption here in New York, so,
er, my fault, actually. Hopefully this will make it all calm down.  
YOUNG GRANT: I don't understand.  
DOCTOR: Do you know what a lightning conductor is?  
YOUNG GRANT: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: Well, it's not like that.  
YOUNG GRANT: I thought you were setting a trap.  
DOCTOR: I was, to protect this. I don't want anyone turning it off, or
stealing it for a Christmas tree.  
YOUNG GRANT: But it looks like a Christmas tree.  
DOCTOR: Of course it does, it's science. Do you want to turn the lights on?  
YOUNG GRANT: Can I?  
DOCTOR: Go on. It's Christmas Day.  
YOUNG GRANT: What do I do?  
DOCTOR: Ah! Right, you put this into this, and you flick all those little
switches on.  
YOUNG GRANT: Nothing's happening.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, because now we get to the cool bit. Come here. Do you see that
little door there? Pop it open. Now we turn on the lights. Pop the gemstone
right in there.  
(Six sets of wires going into a circular holder.)  
YOUNG GRANT: What gemstone?  
DOCTOR: The gemstone that I gave you. Pop it right in there.  
YOUNG GRANT: (sotto) That was a gemstone?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's more than just a gemstone, it's also like a kind of on-
board computer. Come here. Can you see, can you see that little yellow star at
the end of that curve? It comes from near there. Formed in the heart of a red
hole and stabilised in pure dwarf star crystal. The gemstone is intuitive. It
knows what you want and draws energy from the nearest star to make it happen.
There's only four of them left in the universe. The Apocalypse Monks of the
Andorax called this one the Hazandra, the Ghost of Love and Wishes. Okay,
then, pop it in.  
YOUNG GRANT: I thought it was medicine.  
DOCTOR: What?  
YOUNG GRANT: It looked like medicine.  
DOCTOR: What have you done with it?  
YOUNG GRANT: Well, you gave me medicine and a glass of water, and you said you
were a doctor. I thought it was for my cough.  
(There is a red glow in Grant's chest.)  
DOCTOR: Oh! You swallowed it. You can't go round swallowing things. What age
are you, 36?  
YOUNG GRANT: Eight.  
(The Doctor runs the sonic screwdriver over him.)  
YOUNG GRANT: Am I going to get sick?  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. Quite the opposite.  
YOUNG GRANT: The opposite? What's the opposite?  
(Grant's feet have left the ground. The Doctor gently pushes him back down.)  
YOUNG GRANT: What happened?  
DOCTOR: Nothing.  
YOUNG GRANT: What's wrong with me?  
DOCTOR: Well, you've got a cough and a slight case of levitation. Stay calm.  
YOUNG GRANT: What happens if I don't stay calm?  
(The Doctor has to jump to grab the boy's legs.)  
DOCTOR: Oh! Don't panic.  
YOUNG GRANT: What happens if I panic?  
(They zoom off into the night sky, screaming.)  

**[Nursery** **** **]**  

(A baby's crying is being relayed by a monitor. Grown up Grant wakes, puts on
his spectacles and goes to the nursery.)  
GRANT: Oh, hey, you're all right. Hi, you're okay.  
(He picks up the baby.)  
GRANT: Yeah. Ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh! (later, on the phone) Hey, Mrs Lombard. No,
don't worry, Jennifer's fine. She just woke up, but I'm going to put her back
to sleep. No, it's okay, Mrs Lombard. It's what you pay me for. okay.
Goodnight.  

**[Top of the Empire State Building]**  

DOCTOR: Grant, you need to concentrate.  
YOUNG GRANT: What's happened to me?  
DOCTOR: Intuitive crystal, plus too many comic books. The gemstone is giving
you what it thinks you want. You're a superhero!  

**[Harmony Shoal]**  

(A skyscraper with a rotating globe on top, with Harmony Shoal written where
it ought to say Daily Planet. A press conference is closing.)  
BROCK: Any questions after today can be handled by Miss Shuster or Miss
Siegel, who can be contacted on the e-mail addresses provided in your welcome
pack. That's all we have time for, ladies and gentlemen. I hope you had a
stimulating day, and maybe saw a little of what makes Harmony Shoal the
foremost innovator in science and technology the world over. Like we always
say, we're here to open your minds.  
LUCY: Mister Brock, just one more question. I've been looking into your
funding, and you seem to have a lot of benefactors for a research institute.  
BROCK: The world is changing, Miss Fletcher. Science got sexy.  
LUCY: Yeah, but your benefactors? I can't seem to find any of them.  
BROCK: Very simple reason for that. I killed them all, buried them in my back
yard.  
(Laughter.)  
LUCY: How big is your back yard, Mister Brock?  
BROCK: At the last count, Wyoming.  
(More laughter.)  
BROCK: Now, if you good people will excuse me, this young lady will guide you
to the exit.  
NARDOLE: Mister Brock? Er, Mister Brock? Mister Brock? Mister Brock.  
BROCK: Apparently we have one more question.  
NARDOLE: Yes. Where is the little boys' room?  
BROCK: I think you'll find the restrooms to the left, on your way out.  
NARDOLE: No, not the restrooms, the little boys' room.  
BROCK: If you successfully locate the restrooms, I think you'll find
everything you need in there. Thank you all.  
WOMAN: This way, ladies and gentlemen.  
NARDOLE: I don't want a rest. If everyone's just having a rest, I might cause
an incident.  
(Lucy looks across at a woman sweeping the floor. Meanwhile Brock goes to a
man dabbing at his nose and getting a blue stain on his handkerchief.)  
BROCK: Doctor Sim, is there a problem?  
SIM: It's the brains. There's something I need to show you. It's necessary.  
(Brock sees Lucy with the cleaner.)  
BROCK: Later. Meet me here at midnight.  
SIM: Thank you, sir.  
(Midnight, Sim is sitting in front of one of a few rows of computer screens
ranged to the side of the main open area where the conference was held, and
just behind the big corporate logo, when a hand grasps his shoulder and makes
him jump.)  
SIM: Mister Brock. You startled me.  
BROCK: Shall we?  
SIM: Of course.  
(Lucy, dressed as a cleaner, watches them walk through reception, then
follows. Nardole is also watching, and speaks into one of his duffel coat
toggles.)  
NARDOLE: All clear.  

**[Brain safe]**  

(A thick strongroom door opens and the lights come on to reveal a horseshoe
arrangement of three shelves, all containing brains in glass cases.)  
BROCK: Well?  
SIM: Look at them. You see nothing unusual?  
BROCK: I see brains every place except here. (Sim's head.) These specimens
were donated to this facility by our benefactors for a top-secret research
project. A project which is not to be questioned, impeded, or in fact
mentioned by any of the employees of the Harmony Shoal Institute. Even I don't
have the clearance to know what's going on in here.  
(Lucy is eavesdropping.)  
SIM: But why?  
BROCK: It's not your job to ask questions. Stick to science.  
(Sim's eye flickers sideways.)  
BROCK: Something wrong with your eyes?  
SIM: Sir, the first time I came in here, I counted twenty four specimens. The
second time I counted, there were thirty. Now there are thirty six.  
BROCK: Well, I guess they've got the space.  
SIM: You don't understand. There have been no deliveries. I checked it. Some
of these brains, sir, they just... ..arrived.  

**[Outside the Brain Safe]**  

(Lucy leans back to hear someone eating. The Doctor is snacking on sushi or
more likely hosomaki.)  
DOCTOR: It's okay. I'm an intruder too. Yeah, I brought snacks. Mark of a pro.
Keep listening.  

**[Brain Safe]**  

BROCK: Looks like a brain to me. Kind of blue, I guess,but that's the fluid,
right?  
SIM: Yes. That's the fluid. (which is dribbling out of his nose.) Tap the
glass, sir.  
BROCK: What'd you say?  
SIM: Tap the glass, please.  
(Brock taps the glass, and two eyes appear between folds of the brain.)  
BROCK: What? What the hell is that? Is that a joke?  
SIM: No sir, it's not a joke.  
BROCK: It's got eyes! Look at them, they're like (Sim's eyes flicker sideways
again.) They're like _your_ __eyes.  
SIM: Yes sir, they are.  
BROCK: Doctor Sim? What are you pointing at?  
(Sim points at a brain in an empty jar on the top shelf.)  
SIM: I'm pointing at Doctor Sim. Don't look so alarmed. We merely exchanged
containers. You might call this a hijack.  
(Brock punches Sim, who grabs him by the throat, then throws him to the floor.
Sim pushes the two halves of his head back together along the diagonal scar.)  
BROCK: What happened to you? I don't understand.  
SIM: The same thing that is about to happen to you. I had a change of mind.  
(Sim leaves, closing the strongroom door behind him. Three doors slide up
behind the shelves and three blank-faced figures in white surgical scrubs and
masks step out.)  
BROCK: No, no, please, no! Let me out of here! What's happening?What are you
doing?  
(One of the surgeons unscrews the lid of a brain jar.)  

**[Outside the restrooms]**  

(Sim finishes sealing the strongroom door and leaves. The Doctor taps Lucy
with a chopstick and gestures for them to go the opposite way, down some
stairs. The Tardis has parked herself on a mezzanine above the restrooms.)  
DOCTOR: Who are you?  
LUCY: Lucy Fletcher, reporter from the Daily Chronicle. Hang on, why am I
telling you the truth?  
DOCTOR: Spooky, isn't it? Looking for a story?  
LUCY: I think I just found one.  
DOCTOR: Brains with minds of their own? No one will believe that. This is
America.  
LUCY: Who are _you_ __?  
(They go over to a map of the world with markers in it.)  
DOCTOR: Special Agent Dan Dangerous from Scotland Yard, Scotland. The Doctor
for short. See, they've got institutes all over the world. And always in
capital cities.  
NARDOLE: Nope.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, they are, see?  
NARDOLE: New York's not a capital city,is it?  
DOCTOR: (sotto) You don't need to point out the mistakes. That's not what
you're for.  
NARDOLE: Washington's got its own one, yeah.  
(The main lights come on.)  
SIM: I would call Security, but they might leave you alive. I do not want any
awkward questions about the intruders I was forced to shoot for my own
protection.  
DOCTOR: Good plan. Here's another one. (he turns his back on Sim.) Go on. Tell
them you shot us in the back in self-defence. We'll be laughing all the way to
the slab.  
(Knocking nearby.)  
SIM: Face me.  
DOCTOR: Maybe not.  
SIM: Face me now.  
(Knock, knock, knock.)  
SIM: What is that?  
NARDOLE: It's not me.  
LUCY: It sounds like  
DOCTOR: Like someone knocking at a window.  
LUCY: We're on the hundredth floor.  
(They all turn to look at the plate glass windows behind them. A masked man is
standing there in mid-air.  
LUCY: Oh, my God, he's real.  
DOCTOR: Who's real?  
LUCY: The Ghost.  
DOCTOR: Who's the Ghost?  
LUCY: Masked vigilante. But he's  
DOCTOR: What?  
LUCY: Super.  
(The Ghost snaps his fingers and the plate glass shatters. He glides inside.)  
GHOST: Mind if I come in?  
SIM: Impressive. Those windows, like everything in this building, are built to
withstand a blast equivalent to four nuclear explosions.  
GHOST: Sorry about that. Would you like me to call a glazier?  
SIM: Hmm.  
(Sim empties his gun clip into the Ghost, but they just bounce off. The Ghost
brushes the final bullet of his G breast plate, then in a blink he is holding
Sim up by the neck.)  
GHOST: Please understand, it's against my personal code to cause lasting harm
to any individual.  
(He throws Sim against the map.)  
GHOST: However, light to moderate injury's fine.  
NARDOLE: That was good.  
GHOST: Hello. Was that man annoying you?  
LUCY: You're real? I can't believe it, you're actually real.  
GHOST: I'm afraid I am. I enjoy your column, Miss Fletcher.  
LUCY: You read my column? You read? You're real and you read?  
GHOST: Though I find the political bias in your paper's editorial not entirely
to my taste.  
LUCY: I'll pass that on.  
GHOST: Thank you. Who are these gentlemen?  
LUCY: They're, er. I don't actually know.  
DOCTOR: This is my friend, Nardole.  
NARDOLE: Hello, the Ghost.  
DOCTOR: And I'm the Doctor.  
GHOST: The Doctor. I thought we had lots of doctors. I'm the main one.  
(The Ghost gives a little nod then turns to Lucy.)  
GHOST: Can I give you a ride home?  
LUCY: You have a car?  
GHOST: No. (He takes her in his arms.) I hope you're okay with heights.  
LUCY: I'm okay so far.  
GHOST: Have a good evening, gentlemen.  
(He flies of into the night sky, Lucy screaming with delight.)  
NARDOLE: He seems nice.  
DOCTOR: Grant.  

**[Top of the Empire State Building]**  

YOUNG GRANT: So I'm a superhero now?  
DOCTOR: Well, once the gemstone is gone from inside you, you'll be back to
normal. It will pass.  
YOUNG GRANT: But how will it get out?  
DOCTOR: Like I said, it will pass. Looking forward to that.  
YOUNG GRANT: Are you sure?  
DOCTOR: Of course I'm not sure. Nothing's ever sure. Just promise me one
thing. For as long as you have these powers, you will never, ever use them.  
YOUNG GRANT: Sure.  

**[Street]**  

GHOST: Is this the right building? They all look the same from up there.  
LUCY: Yeah. Yeah, this is me, thanks.  
GHOST: Well, I certainly hope this unpleasant experience hasn't put you off a
career in journalism.  
LUCY: Oh, no, no, no, not at all.  
(Something beeps from a pouch in the Ghost's cape. He turns to check a baby
monitor.)  
GHOST: Sorry. Duty calls.  
LUCY: Look at that. The Bat-Signal's an app now? What is it? Bank robbery?
Hijack?  
GHOST: Er, something like that. Excuse me.  
(He flies off.)  
LUCY: Go get 'em.  

**[Nursery]**  

(Baby Jennifer is crying when the Ghost flies into his bedroom window, does a
Wonder Woman twirl to change into mild-mannered Grant, puts on his spectacles
then discovers that the crib is empty. The Doctor is cradling the baby.)  
DOCTOR: With great power comes great responsibility. No man worthy of the
title leaves a baby alone.  
GRANT: How did you find me?  
DOCTOR: I tracked the gemstone inside you.  

**[Apar** **tment** **]**  

(They go through to the main living area, with kitchenette in the corner and a
dining table, etc.)  
DOCTOR: Your powers, they don't belong in this world. They're an anomaly. You
promised me you'd never use them.  
GRANT: May I take her?  
DOCTOR: She's yours?  
GRANT: I'm hers. I'm her nanny.  
DOCTOR: (handing Jennifer over) You're her nanny?  
GRANT: Yeah, her nanny. You got a problem with that?  
DOCTOR: No, no, it's just, well, okay, so you are a superhero and a nanny?  
GRANT: Well, you've got to make a buck somehow. I mean, you don't get paid for
saving people.  
NARDOLE: Oh, you don't have to tell us. Here you go, nice and warm. And tasty.  
(Grant takes the baby bottle from Nardole, who then spots a toy to play with.)  
NARDOLE: Ooo, elephant.  
GRANT: It's fine. It's a long-range baby-monitor. I can get back to this
apartment quicker than most people can get to their kids' bedrooms.  
DOCTOR: Grant, Grant, this is insane. Look, I'm me, the Doctor, and even I
think this is insane.  
NARDOLE: Even him.  
GRANT: I can cope.  
DOCTOR: Of course you can't. When do you sleep? When are you not on call? How
complicated do you need your life to be?  
(The apartment door opens and closes. The Doctor and Nardole have nowhere to
hide.)  
GRANT: Well, not as complicated as it's about to get. Er, we're in here, Mrs
Lombard.  
LUCY: Oh, Jennifer, look at you, up again? Don't you ever sleep?  
GRANT: Did you have a good evening, Mrs Lombard?  
LUCY: Oh, it was work. Why would it be good?  
GRANT: Well, I don't know, you seem a little buzzed. I thought maybe you'd met
someone.  
LUCY: Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. Grant (spots the Doctor and Nardole.) What
are you doing here?  
NARDOLE: We could ask you the same question. But it's your apartment, so we
probably won't.  
DOCTOR: Well, we, we, we, we were worried about you. We wanted to make sure
that you were all right, so, er, we followed you.  
LUCY: You followed me and got here first?  
DOCTOR: Well, that's just a measure of our concern.  
NARDOLE: Very concerned.  
GRANT: They said they knew you. I let them in.  
LUCY: We met tonight. We need to talk, you and me.  
GRANT: Oh! Did something happen?  
LUCY: Nothing for you to worry your pretty little head about. I'll put her to
bed.  
GRANT: I can do that.  
LUCY: No, it's okay, I want to.  
(Lucy leaves them.)  
GRANT: Lombard's her married name. He ran off when the baby came along.  
DOCTOR: Lucy. Of course.  

**[High school]**  

(Grant is sitting on a bench staring at the floor as the other students go
by.)  
DOCTOR: Hey.  
TEEN GRANT: What are you doing here?  
DOCTOR: I'm your relief algebra teacher. Thought I'd check in on you and see
how you're coping.  
TEEN GRANT: Well, it hasn't passed, if that's what you want to know.  
DOCTOR: I think that it's a part of your DNA now. It's bonded with you. I'm
sorry. Why aren't you looking at me?  
TEEN GRANT: I don't want to.  
DOCTOR: You're not looking at anyone. Are you shy now? Is that floor really
interesting?  
TEEN GRANT: I'm not shy. I just can't stop it.  
DOCTOR: Can't stop what?  
TEEN GRANT: The X-ray vision.  
DOCTOR: Oh.  
TEEN GRANT: I'm in hell. Naked hell. I just can't look at people.  
DOCTOR: It's the gemstone, responding to puberty.  
TEEN LUCY: Hey, Grant!  
TEEN GRANT: Hey, Lucy!  
DOCTOR: You really like her, don't you?  
TEEN GRANT: I have X-ray eyes. I like everyone.  
DOCTOR: But Lucy is your favourite.  
TEEN GRANT: Who says?  
(The Doctor gently pulls him down from halfway up the wall.)  

GRANT [OC]: A couple of years after high school, I ran into her again.  

**[Fire** **escape** **]**  

GRANT: She even remembered me.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that was lucky.  
GRANT: And I was with my best friend at the time, and she couldn't take her
eyes off him.  
DOCTOR: Okay.  
GRANT: Love at first sight.  
DOCTOR: Right.  
GRANT: Then marriage, then a baby, and then he ran off with someone else.  
DOCTOR: Leaving, I suppose, the field open for you to move in.  
GRANT: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: And care for the child she'd had by another man.  
GRANT: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: So she could keep working and possibly date other friends of yours.  
GRANT: Pretty much.  
DOCTOR: You tiger. Thank you!  
GRANT: Who are you thanking?  
DOCTOR: The universe. There's somebody worse at this than me.  
(Fire engines roar past with a police escort. Grant hands the Doctor his
spectacles. Whoosh!)  
GRANT: Excuse me.  
(Squeak.)  
LUCY: This is Mister Huffle. Mister Huffle feels pain.  
(She squeezes the toy with the tufty hair and it squeals. Oh, how I want one
of those.)  
LUCY: Meet me in the kitchen.  

**[Apartment]**  

(Lucy is at the table typing on her laptop as the television on the
kitchenette wall reports a major fire in Manhattan. She points to a chair and
the Doctor sits obediently.)  
LUCY: With you in a minute.  
(On the television, the Ghost flies into the burning building.)  
LUCY: So, you're from Scotland Yard?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
(Lucy grabs Mister Huffle, hard.)  
LUCY: It's fine if you don't tell me your secrets. I intend to keep mine. But
don't lie to me.  
DOCTOR: Or what?  
LUCY: I hurt Mister Huffle.  
(Huffle re-inflates with a long squeak.)  
LUCY: I assume you belong to some kind of, I don't know, agency, I don't care
which one, and that your current assignment is to investigate Harmony Shoal.
Correct?  
DOCTOR: No, I was just passing through  
(Lucy grabs Huffle with both hands.)  
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Yes, fine, okay, yes, broadly speaking, yes.  
LUCY: What are those brain things?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. It's nothing that need concern you.  
LUCY: I'm a reporter. That category does not exist. What are they?  
DOCTOR: You wouldn't believe me if I told you.  
LUCY: No reason not to tell me, then.  
(Huffle is struggling to re-inflate.)  
DOCTOR: Those brains, they aren't just brains. They're independent alien life
forms.  
LUCY: And?  
DOCTOR: They migrate from planet to planet, extracting and replacing the
central nervous systems of compatible hosts.  
LUCY: And?  
DOCTOR: Harmony Shoal is a multinational corporation whose true purpose is to
extract and replace the brains of key authority figures from around the world,
and prepare Earth for full colonisation.  
(Huffle re-inflates with a quick squeak!)  
LUCY: Ha.  
DOCTOR: You believe me?  
LUCY: I don't think you're lying. Slightly different. What has Harmony Shoal
got to do with the Ghost?  
DOCTOR: Nothing.  
LUCY: Ah, so you know who the Ghost really is, then?  
DOCTOR: No, I have no idea.  
LUCY: Oh, stop it. We just went to a top-secret science research facility
apparently run by brains from space, and a flying man with superpowers turns
up. Anybody would assume the two were connected, except for somebody who
already knew they weren't. So, clearly, you know the Ghost and trust him.
Nobody trusts anybody without knowing who they are, so you know who he really
is. So now you can tell me. Who is he? Oh, that's interesting. You don't work
for an agency, do you?  
DOCTOR: Don't I?  
LUCY: You're not used to being spoken to like this, which means you don't have
a boss or an employer. So why are you investigating Harmony Shoal? What's in
it for you?  
DOCTOR: I like to keep busy.  
LUCY: Why? What happened to you?  
DOCTOR: Nothing. Oh, look!  
(He grabs Huffle and goes to the television. The Ghost is being interviewed.)  
LUCY: Oh!  
GHOST [on TV]: Because fire prevention is the responsibility of every citizen,
so get a smoke detector!  
(Jennifer cries. Lucy turns away and doesn't see the Ghost check his baby
monitor.)  
GHOST [on TV]: Sorry, duty calls.  
LUCY: Oh, look at him go. I need to know who he is.  
GRANT: You're all right. She just needs a change.  
LUCY: Oh, it's okay, I'll do it. You're so quick, Grant.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. He's definitely quick.  
(The Doctor puts Grant's spectacles back on him.)  
REPORTER [on TV]: In less than a minute, this major fire  
DOCTOR: Do you have any time off?  
GRANT: Sure.  
REPORTER 2 [on TV]: As the storm hit, it became clear that two children were
still trapped on the big wheel. The two small can be seen clinging on to the  
(Grant's spectacles fall off again.)  
LUCY [OC]: Doctor?  

**[Nursery]**

LUCY: So, can you put me in touch with him? The real guy behind the mask?  
DOCTOR: You're smart. You're so clever I actually noticed. I hardly ever
listen when other people are talking.  
LUCY: So what?  
DOCTOR: So why can't you find him yourself?  
LUCY: I got a lead.  
DOCTOR: What lead?  
LUCY: You. You know him. Don't even try telling me you don't.  
DOCTOR: Maybe you know him too.  
LUCY: Hey, where'd Grant go?  
GRANT: Right here, Mrs Lombard.  
LUCY: Oh.  
GRANT: Would you like your coffee?  
LUCY: Oh, no, I'm okay, thanks. Are you all right?  
GRANT: Sure. Why?  
LUCY: You're kind of wet.  
GRANT: I prefer mild-mannered.  
(Lucy turns from the dripping Grant to the Doctor.)  
LUCY: Can you put me in touch with him?  
DOCTOR: The Ghost?  
LUCY: Yeah, the Ghost.  
(Grant shakes his head.)  
DOCTOR: Mrs Lombard, there are some situations which are just too stupid to be
allowed to continue.  
(Grant whooshes off and the phone rings.)  
LUCY: Hang on. Hello.  
GHOST [OC]: Is this Lucy Fletcher?  
LUCY: Yes. Who is this?  
GHOST [OC]: Sorry, I had to fly.  
LUCY: (gasp) Am I? Sorry, am I, am I speaking to the Ghost?  
GHOST [OC]: Hello, Lucy.  
LUCY: So, I'm hoping this means I'm getting an interview.  
GHOST [OC]: An interview is entirely possible, but I must make one thing
clear. There must be no talk of who I really am.  
(Grant is in the kitchen area. We get split screen.)  
LUCY: Hey, you make the headlines, you make the rules.  
GRANT: Discussion of my true identity would put the people closest to me at
risk. That is not acceptable.  
LUCY: Fair enough, get that. How about tomorrow night?  
GRANT: For what?  
LUCY: The interview? We could get dinner.  
GRANT: Dinner.  
LUCY: Do you eat dinner?  
GRANT: Of course I eat dinner.  
LUCY: Okay, then. Pick me up here tomorrow night, er, eight o'clock? I'll wait
for you on the roof? Wait a second.  

**[Apartment]**  

(Grant hides the phone in the oven.)  
LUCY: Grant, could you babysit for me tomorrow night?  
GRANT: Er  
LUCY: Please, it's important.  
BOTH: I've got a date. A date?  
LUCY: Er, kind of a date.  
GRANT: Okay.  
LUCY: An interview. Are you seeing someone?  
GRANT: Er  
LUCY: None of my business. I mean. But are you? I mean, you never even go out,
and suddenly you've got a date?  
GRANT: Yeah, well, it kind of came as a surprise to me too.  
LUCY: I'm sorry?  
GRANT: It's complicated.  
DOCTOR: I can confirm that it's definitely complicated.  
GRANT: You know, don't worry about it, I'll look after Jennifer.  
LUCY: You will?  
DOCTOR: You will?  
GRANT: I'll figure it out. Let me take care of it.  
LUCY: Okay.  
GRANT: Okay.  
(Lucy leaves.)  
DOCTOR: (sotto) She's jealous.  
GRANT: (sotto) I'm jealous!  
DOCTOR: Grant, you are jealous of you.  
GRANT: Technically, she's jealous of her.  
DOCTOR: Grant, how long have you known this woman?  
GRANT: Since elementary school. Twenty four years.  
DOCTOR: Twenty four years? Yeah, of course it would be that, wouldn't it.  
GRANT: Are you okay?  
DOCTOR: Time passes for everyone. Even for me. So, please, as much as it is
possible for a human male, try not to be an idiot.  
GRANT: No, seriously, are you okay?  
DOCTOR: I'm always okay.  
(The Doctor looks at Mister Huffle and walks away. Sirens wail, Grant sighs
and removes his spectacles. Whoosh!)  

**[Harmony Shoal]**  

(Sim is working at a keyboard when Brock walks up.)  
SIM: Ah, welcome, brother. How is your vehicle?  
(Cracking sounds as Brock adjusts his skull.)  
BROCK: A little cramped.  
SIM: It will relax with wear. Observe this. The finest vehicle this planet has
to offer.  
(CCTV footage of his encounter with The Ghost.)  
BROCK: Interesting. And can it be acquired?  
SIM: A plan is being formulated.  
BROCK: This one. Who is he?  
(The Doctor, of course.)  
SIM: I'm not sure. But he may be dangerous.  
BROCK: He doesn't look dangerous.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: Boo! I'm talking to you live! (the lights come on)  
DOCTOR: In person! You can jump back in your skins now. Except, of course,
they're not _your_ skins, are they?  
BROCK: What do you want?  
DOCTOR: Mercy.  
BROCK: We have none.  
DOCTOR: It's not a request, it's an offer. I'll give you a head start. I'll
close my eyes and I'll count to ten. I will make no attempt to follow you.
But, starting now, all of you, everywhere, pack your bags and get off of this
planet.  
BROCK: Are you declaring war on us?  
DOCTOR: I am drawing a line, and I'm suggesting you step back from it with
awesome speed.  
BROCK: Then war it is.  
(Brock opens its head along the diagonal scar, reaches in and takes out a
weapon.)  
DOCTOR: Multi-nucleate organism, functioning as an infinitely adaptable,
independently functioning, peripatetic central nervous system. Good to keep an
open mind. Ha! Of course it won't work.  
BROCK: What won't work?  
DOCTOR: Whatever it is, whatever you've got planned. Stating the obvious,
you've set up in every capital city in the world, so clearly the plan is to
unzip the head of every world leader, pop yourselves inside. Of course, you
can't just roll up with a team of surgeons to the White House or to the
Kremlin, because they've got big fences, shouty people and cross dogs.  
SIM: They will come to us, and they will come running.  
DOCTOR: Oh. I very much doubt it. Take this!  
(The Doctor takes a round object wrapped in paper from his pocket. Sim takes
it.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, take that!  
BROCK: Who are you?  
DOCTOR: There have been many attempts to conquer the Earth. I've lost count.
Not one of them has succeeded. Not a single one. They all lost and burned and
ran. That's who I am.  
(The Doctor puts his fingers in his mouth and whistles.)  
SIM: What is this?  
DOCTOR: It's a burger. I always bring a snack. But I don't want it now. He's
put me off my dinner.  
(The Tardis materialises around the Doctor.)  

**[Tardis]**  

DOCTOR: Very good. Right on target.  
NARDOLE: Trial and error, to be honest. A few accidental stop-offs along the
way.  
(Nardole is wearing ornate bejewelled robes and headdress, and concentrating
on flying the Tardis smoothly.)  
DOCTOR: Where'd you get the robes?  
NARDOLE: Twelfth century Constantinople. I ruled firmly, but wisely.  
(The Doctor moves a lever, Nardole moves it back.)  
NARDOLE: Ah, ah, ah. How did it go?  
DOCTOR: Oh, you know. Issued a warning, donated a burger, nicked some
stationery. The Ghost. What have you got?  
NARDOLE: The whole story.  
DOCTOR: Fact me, baby. It's why I reassembled you.  
NARDOLE: No, sir, that's not the reason, is it.  
DOCTOR: Oh, just get on with it.  
NARDOLE: You cut me out of Hydroflax because you were worried you'd be lonely.
And we both know why, don't we. But, oh, look at you, avoiding the subject.  
DOCTOR: I'm not avoiding anything, I'm just trying to save a planet.  
NARDOLE: Which is what you always do when the conversation turns serious.  

**[Nursery]**  

LUCY: Good girl.  
(Lucy tucks Jennifer into her cot.)  
GRANT: Mrs Lombard? You look nice.  
LUCY: You look surprised.  
GRANT: No, no, no, it's just that, well, normally you wear the little red
dress when you're er  
LUCY: This is business, Grant. Strictly business. So I won't be late.  
GRANT: Okay.  
(Lucy leaves, Grant rips his shirt open and flies up to the roof carrying a
picnic hamper.)  

**[Roof]**  

LUCY: Hi.  
(She has changed into the little red dress.)  
GHOST: Hi.  
LUCY: Is something wrong?  
GHOST: You look nice.  
LUCY: You look surprised.  
GHOST: I am, a little.  

**[Tardis]**  

DOCTOR: He's not supposed to be using those powers. He made a promise.  
NARDOLE: What, like the Time Lord promise never to interfere in the affairs of
other peoples or planets?  
DOCTOR: I glued your head back on. You should have a little bit more respect.  
(The Tardis lands.)  
NARDOLE: Oh!  
DOCTOR: Come on.  
NARDOLE: Where are we?  
DOCTOR: Where we were, except not.  
NARDOLE: Oh. Sorry?  

**[Harmony Shoal]**  

(Happy people are running towards the exit of an identical building to the one
in New York.)  
NARDOLE: Oh, Tokyo branch.  
DOCTOR: Yep.  
NARDOLE: A bit empty, isn't it?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I created a distraction. I flooded downstairs with Pokémon.  
(The Doctor sits at a computer.)  
JAPANESE MAN: You're not supposed to be in here.  
DOCTOR: I know, it's terrible. Sorry, I'm doing everything I can to stop me.
See that?  
NARDOLE: It's a signal, isn't it?  
DOCTOR: It's a signal beaming into space. There was one from the New York
office too. There's something in low orbit.  

**[Roof]**  

(A table has been laid, with a candle as centrepiece.)  
LUCY: I did book a restaurant.  
GHOST: I'm not comfortable in restaurants.  
LUCY: I suppose you get a lot of stares, dressed like that.  
GHOST: Right back at you. Are you sure you're warm enough?  
LUCY: Yeah. Okay, no.  
(He lights the candle with a snap of his fingers.)  
GHOST: Now?  
LUCY: Yeah, definitely.  

**[Tar** **dis** **]**  

DOCTOR: Yep, low orbit.  
NARDOLE: But you can't get a fix on it?  
DOCTOR: I'm trying. The shielding's too good.  
NARDOLE: But can't we track the signals?  
DOCTOR: Tracking them now. Boom.  
NARDOLE: Ha, ha!  

**[Roof]**  

LUCY: So what powers do you have?  
GHOST: Well, basic flying, basic super strength.  
LUCY: Basic X-ray vision?  
GHOST: Yep.  
LUCY: Is that ever tempting?  
GHOST: Adolescence was difficult.  
LUCY: In what sense?  
GHOST: It went on a lot longer.  
LUCY: How much longer?  
GHOST: I'll let you know.  
(On a green screen zooming in on The Ghost - Subject Located.)  

**[Harmony Shoal]**  

BROCK: We're moving into position. It won't be long now.  
SIM: The Ghost is located.  
BROCK: Action the surgeons.  
(The three doors in the Brain Safe open.)  

**[Earth orbit]**  

(Looking out of the Tardis door at a spaceship. Nardole is back in his normal
clothes.)  
DOCTOR: That's what Harmony Shoal is signalling to. Shall we pop over and have
a look? Pretty sure no-one's on board.  
NARDOLE: How do you know? Did you scan for lifeforms?  
DOCTOR: No. All the lights are off.  
NARDOLE: Mmm.  

**[R** **oof** **]**  

(Lucy is recording the interview and taking written notes.)  
LUCY: Do you have a girlfriend? Boyfriend? Well, there has been speculation.
You do fly around New York dressed in rubber with a big G on your chest.  
GHOST: Are we very slightly stereotyping here?  
LUCY: I get it. There's some stuff you'd like to keep private.  
GHOST: Was it the mask that tipped you off?  
LUCY: How do you cope with your double life?  
GHOST: I'm nothing special. Everyone has a day job.  
LUCY: Come on. You spend half your time as a regular person.  
GHOST: I spend all my time that way.  
LUCY: And the other half saving the world. How do you cope?  
GHOST: How do _you_ __cope with a career and a baby?  
LUCY: How do you know I have a baby?  
GHOST: I did my research.  
LUCY: I have a nanny, that's basically your answer.  
GHOST: Yes, of course.  
LUCY: He's downstairs right now.  
GHOST: I see.  
LUCY: And, yes, I said he.  
GHOST: Yes, you did.  
LUCY: Yes, I did.  
GHOST: Is that a problem?  
LUCY: I'm sorry, it's just that guys like you sometimes find it funny, a man
being a nanny.  
GHOST: With respect, Miss Fletcher, there aren't too many guys like me.  
LUCY: There aren't too many guys like Grant either!  
GHOST: You okay?  
LUCY: Excuse me a minute.  
(Lucy walks to the parapet around the edge of the roof. An ambulance pulls up
outside the building, and Brock lets the three surgeons out of the back.)  

**[Spaceship]**  

(The Tardis materialises. The spaceship is dripping with moisture.)  
DOCTOR: Bridge is this way.  
(They walk past an electric toothbrush on a shelf, which beeps and flashes
red.)  

**[Har** **mony Shoal** **]**  

(The alarm from the spaceship sounds here. Sim ejects a man from his computer
and starts typing.)  
SIM: Move.  
(Up on the spaceship, two humanoids with half a head and a red light sticking
out of them, follow the Doctor and Nardole.)  

**[Roof]**  

GHOST: I didn't mean to imply there's something wrong with your friend Grant.
You know, not everyone can be a superhero.  
LUCY: Not everyone can be a nanny! Sorry. He's downstairs right now and he was
supposed to be on a date and he cancelled it and you know what's really
bugging me about that? Who is he dating? Why is that bugging me? Why do I
care?  
(The Ghost removes his mask behind her back. He puts his hand on her shoulder
but she walks away and sits down again.)  
LUCY: What's wrong with me?  
GRANT: There's probably something I ought to tell you.  
LUCY: Grant. The perfect name. A man I take for granted.  
GRANT: Er, really, if you could just look up about now  
LUCY: Always there, always kind, never lies. I even lied to him about this
dress but I don't think he's ever told a single lie to me, not once, about
anything. Not once.  
(When Lucy finally looks up, the Ghost has his mask back on.)  
GHOST: That's very commendable.  
(The roof door opens.)  
BROCK: Good evening. Please, take no aggressive action, or your friend's life
is over.  
LUCY: Mister Brock? What do you want here?  
BROCK: The same thing you do, Miss Fletcher. His body.  
(A surgeon places a jar containing a brain on the table.)  

**[Spaceship]**  

(The Doctor runs his sonic screwdriver over the bridge control panels.)  
DOCTOR: Hmm.  
NARDOLE: Bit rubbish, innit?  
DOCTOR: Don't touch anything.  
NARDOLE: No, it's quite safe, it's just a freighter.  
DOCTOR: I said, don't touch.  
NARDOLE: What do you  
DOCTOR: You see? The reactor core. It's cycling at critical. Someone's been
rewiring. This isn't a ship any more. It's a giant bomb.  
NARDOLE: Ooo! Just going to move out. (spots movement on a monitor) Doctor!  
(The Doctor sonicks the bridge door shut.)  
DOCTOR: They're security drones, that's all.  
NARDOLE: So what do they want a bomb for?  
DOCTOR: What does anybody want a bomb for?  
NARDOLE: Surely they want to conquer the Earth, not blow it up.  
DOCTOR: Oh, you couldn't blow up the Earth with this. But you could wipe out a
city. Good point, well made.  
NARDOLE: What point?  
DOCTOR: New York. It's not a capital city. You're quite right.  
NARDOLE: Oh. I don't understand.  
DOCTOR: What if you dropped this ship on New York? What would happen?  
NARDOLE: The reactor core would split and New York would vaporise.  
DOCTOR: Not all of it. Not all of it, Nardole. Remember what he said, the
scary little German fella?  
SIM [on monitor]: This building can withstand a blast up to four times the
strength of a nuclear explosion.  
DOCTOR: Oh, this is very good, very meta.  
SIM [on monitor]: Did you understand?  
DOCTOR: You're stage-managing an alien attack when the aliens have already
landed.  
NARDOLE; But why?  
DOCTOR: Because of what happens next. When everyone thinks that the Earth is
being attacked from space, what then?  
NARDOLE: Mass panic.  
(Thumping on door.)  
NARDOLE: Ooo, speaking of panic!  
DOCTOR: Don't worry, it's triple deadlock-sealed. It'll hold for at least ten
minutes. The people will panic, yes. But what about the world leaders? The
presidents and kings, the prime ministers and generals? What will they do?
What do the rich old men always do when the fighting starts? They'll find the
safest place to hide themselves away and send all their young people to die.
And where's the safest place in every capital city now? What's the only part
of New York still standing?  
NARDOLE: Harmony Shoal.  
DOCTOR: New York isn't a capital city. It's a shop window. When the world is
in danger, come hide with us. Harmony Shoal will open its doors to the
terrified leaders of the world.  
SIM [on monitor]: And they will come running.  
DOCTOR: A few hours later, every politician and commander-in-chief will have a
zip in their head. An alien sitting inside their skull. In one day of terror,
the executive authority of Planet Earth will pass to Harmony Shoal. It's a
good plan. I like it. How come our side never gets plans like that?  
SIM [on monitor]: The humans have no plan at all.  
DOCTOR: (laughs) That's where you're wrong. They have the same plan they
always have.  
SIM [on monitor]: What plan?  
DOCTOR; Me.  
NARDOLE: Hey, hey!  
DOCTOR: Don't do that.  
NARDOLE: Sorry.  

**[Roo** **f** **]**  

(The Ghost is being restrained by two surgeons. Brock takes the lid off the
brain jar.)  
BROCK: The operation is swift and quite painless. You realise I'm talking to
my colleague in the jar?  
GHOST: You'll find me a lot harder to cut open than your previous victims.  
BROCK: Harmony Shoal have been conquering your world for five years. Whatever
our faults, we have the virtue of patience.  
LUCY: Ghost, don't worry about me. Do what you've got to do.  
BROCK: Do anything at all and we'll kill her.  
LUCY: Don't listen to him!  
BROCK: Remove the mask.I like to see their faces.  
GHOST: I'm truly sorry.  
(The Ghost thumps the surgeons and flies into the sky.)  
BROCK: On the bright side, at least I get to kill you.  
(Brock opens his head and takes out his gun.)  
LUCY: No, you can't. That's the trouble with one hostage. You kill me, the
only reason he'll come back is for revenge. You really want to deal with that?  
BROCK: One hostage? (closes his head) Isn't there a child downstairs?  
(Grant falls through the roof door.)  
GRANT: Nobody touches that child.  
BROCK: And who are you?  
(Grant holds out the baby monitor.)  
GRANT: I'm the nanny.  

**[Spaceship]**  

SIM [on monitor]: Stand away from the controls, Doctor. Any attempt to
interfere with them will precipitate the attack immediately.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that. Very clever. One question, as long as I'm here. Why
haven't you done it already?  
SIM [on monitor]: When the time is right, there will be no delay.  
DOCTOR: Oh, you told me something there. You told me something useful. You
shouldn't have done that.  
SIM [on monitor]: What did I tell you?  
DOCTOR: You told me that the time is currently wrong.  
NARDOLE: Oh, it's the smile. I don't like the smile!  
DOCTOR: The Sword of Damocles hanging over New York. I can't destroy it, I
can't remove it, I can't stop it falling. There's only one thing I can do.  
NARDOLE: What?  
DOCTOR: The unexpected! The thing about being in a room full of buttons and
switches is, I love buttons and switches!  
NARDOLE: Oh, don't!  
SIM [on monitor]: What are you doing?  
NARDOLE: No!  
SIM [on monitor]: What are you doing?  
(Pressing buttons and throwing switches. The spaceship tilts forward.)  
COMPUTER: Thrusters engaged.  
DOCTOR: Next stop New York. Say wheeee!  
NARDOLE: Oh!  

**[Harmony Shoal]**  

SIM: Lower shields! Brace for impact! New York is under attack.  

**[Roof]**  

BROCK: It occurs to me, Miss Fletcher, I now have three hostages.  
GRANT: Why don't you point the gun at me?  
BROCK: What difference would it make? Besides, this is the one the Ghost will
come for, I think. Ghost! Can you hear me? Do you have super-hearing? I'm
going to kill her. I'm going to kill her right now!  

**[Spaceship]**  

(Alarms wailing, fire coming off the heat shield.)  
NARDOLE: Stop! You're going to destroy New York!  
DOCTOR: Of course not! Now the bomb is arming, the shields are down  
NARDOLE: Help!  
DOCTOR: We can use the Tardis to hijack the controls and divert it into space!
No bomb, no plan, no problem!  
NARDOLE: No, wait! Those things are out there.  
DOCTOR: The ship is crashing! They're not going to be worrying about us!  
(The Doctor sonicks the door open and an arm grabs Nardole.)  
NARDOLE: Ooo! Oh!  
(He sonicks it shut again, trapping the arm.)  
DOCTOR: Okay, plan B.  
NARDOLE: Doctor! Help me!  
DOCTOR: Oh, you'll be fine. This ship will have blown up long before you've
been strangled to death!  
NARDOLE: What's plan B?  
DOCTOR: I have no idea, but it's going to be a very big relief when I think of
it.  
NARDOLE; You are completely out of your mind!  
DOCTOR: How is that news to anyone?  
NARDOLE: I know you miss her, but couldn't you just write a poem?  
DOCTOR: Excellent! The controls are locked, but they've still got a little bit
of give. It means I can take aim.  
NARDOLE: At what?!  
DOCTOR: New York. There's exactly one chance, and one is all you need.  
NARDOLE: No! Nooo.  
(The Doctor drops his sonic screwdriver into the controls.)  

**[Roof]**  

(Rumbling sound. They look up.)  
BROCK: No. No, it's too soon.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Grant! Grant! This is the Doctor! You are the only living thing
on Earth that can hear this frequency. Look up! We're coming right at you. If
that thing hits the ground, then New York is finished! Over to you.  
(Grant removes his spectacles and uses his Ghost voice.)  
GRANT: Mrs Lombard, please, get down.  
(Lucy obeys.)  

**[Spaceship]**  

DOCTOR: Nardole!  
NARDOLE: Yeah?  
DOCTOR: Brace for impact!  
(Nardole screams as the fiery object streaks through the atmosphere, then
boom, blackout.)  

**[Street]**  

(Traffic screeches to a halt and the people get out to look up.)  
MAN: What is that?  
WOMAN: Up there!  
(Mobile phones take photos and videos. Up on the roof, Grant is holding up the
spaceship with one hand. Triumphant Superman-like music plays.)  

**[S** **paceship** **]**  

DOCTOR: Nardole? Nardole!  
NARDOLE: Okay, one more, but text me a rickshaw.  
DOCTOR: Nardole, it worked. The reactor core didn't split.  
NARDOLE: Why not?  
DOCTOR: Shock absorber.  

**[Roof]**  

GRANT: Mrs Lombard, I realise in many ways it would have been better to have
mentioned something about this earlier in the evening, but, please, don't slap
me. I think I'm holding a giant bomb. (The Tardis materialises.)  
DOCTOR: There, on you go, take a look at him. That's why _you_ don't stand a
chance. You want to know why? He's actually left-handed.  
(Grant is holding the spaceship nose cone with his right hand, and the baby
monitor in his left.)  
GRANT: Sorry, instinct. I couldn't let go of this.  
(Lucy is very close to Grant.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, oh, ho! Ho! If you two are about to get excited, maybe you could
get rid of that spaceship first.  
LUCY: You know what? I think I prefer you in your superhero costume.  
GRANT: It's a bit difficult for me to change right now.  
LUCY: I'll do it for you.  
(She puts his spectacles on him, then they kiss. They lift off.)  
DOCTOR: Grant! Grant! Remember, when you're finished, throw that thing into
the sun. Jennifer's still downstairs!  
(The baby monitor lands at the Doctor's feet. Jennifer is crying.)  
BROCK: So, Doctor, you think this is over?  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
(He sonicks the gun out of Brock's hand.)  
DOCTOR: Your bomb's gone, your plan's finished. (helicopters) And look,
there's UNIT, on the way to close your head office. It's almost like they've
been tipped off.  
BROCK: The vengeance of Harmony Shoal is known and feared throughout the five
star systems!  
DOCTOR: Ooo, is it. Is it really. Well, I'd like to stick around and listen,
but it's been a very long night. Also, someone needs changing. You're not the
only one that's full of it.  

**[Harmony Shoal]**  

SOLDIERS: Let's go, let's go, let's go! Get down! Down here now!  
WOMAN: Get off of me!  
OFFICER: And he was like this when you found him?  
SOLDIER: Yes, sir.  
(Sim is slumped forward. The officer sits him up and sees that his eye sockets
are empty.)  
OFFICER: Wait here. I'm putting a call into Osgood.  
(We are shown that the soldier has a diagonal scar across his face, and his
eyes flicker sideways.)  

**[Apartment]**  

DOCTOR: So, no more Ghost, then?  
GRANT: Nah, laid to rest.  
LUCY: Are you sure?  
GRANT: Yeah, of course I'm sure. I mean, life's not a comic book, right,
Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Possibly I'm not the right person to ask.  
LUCY: What if something happens? What if the whole world is in danger?  
GRANT: Well, you know, maybe I'll keep the outfit, then. You know, just in
case.  
LUCY: Hmm.  
DOCTOR: The world will be fine. I've been away for a while, but I'm back. I'll
take care of anything that comes up.  
GRANT: You were away?  
NARDOLE: Huh. Twenty four years. What a night.  
GRANT: Where'd you go?  
LUCY: Wrong question. (puts Mister Huffle on the table) What was her name?  
DOCTOR: I'm sure that I must be busy. I better go.  
GRANT: You okay?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, I'm okay.  
(Lucy squeezes Mister Huffle.)  
DOCTOR: Things end. That's all. Everything ends, and it's always sad. But
everything begins again too, and that's always happy. Be happy. I'll look
after everything else. Nardole.  
LUCY: Hey, Doctor? (throws Mister Huffle to him) Keep it real.  
(The Doctor leaves.)  
NARDOLE: Her name was River Song. They were together for a while and they were
very happy. And then she died, a long time ago, in a library.  
GRANT: Are you sure he's going to be all right?  
NARDOLE: Hmm. He's the Doctor. He's very brave and he's very silly and I
think, for a time, he's going to be very sad. But I promise, in the end, he'll
be all right. I'll make sure of it. Bye!  
(Nardole leaves. Mister Huffle is on the Tardis console.)  
LUCY: You never explained. Who exactly is he? Doctor who?  
GRANT: Doctor Mysterio.
