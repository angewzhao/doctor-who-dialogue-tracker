**The Zygon Invasion**  
  
Original Airdate: 31 Oct 2015  

Once upon a time, there were Three Doctors.  
(10th, 11th and War Doctor in the Tardis.)  
Two Osgoods.  
**  
[National Gallery lift]**  
  
(Previously on The Day of the Doctor, in case you don't recognise it.)  
(Osgood is cringing in the corner of the lift sucking on her asthma inhaler as
a Zygon snarls at her before transforming into her double.)  
OSGOOD: The Doctor will save me. The Doctor will save me.  
OSGOOD-Z: Excuse me, I'm going to need my inhaler.  
  
One peace treaty.  
  
**[Black Archive]**  
  
DOCTOR 10: Any second now, you're going to stop that countdown. Both of you.
Together.  
DOCTOR 11: And then you're going to negotiate the most perfect treaty of all
time.  
DOCTOR 10: Safeguards all round, completely fair on both sides.  
DOCTOR 11: And the key to perfect negotiation?  
DOCTOR 10: Not knowing what side you're on.  
(The Doctors push back their chairs, stand up, and get out their sonic
screwdrivers.)  
DOCTOR 11: So, for the next few hours, until we decide to let you out  
DOCTOR 10: No one in this room will be able to remember if they're human  
DOCTOR 11: Or Zygon.  
(Doctor 10 jumps onto the table, followed by 11.)  
DOCTOR 10: Whoops-a-daisy!  
(Memory filter in the ceiling explodes.)  
BOTH KATES: Cancel the detonation!  
  
**[Office]**  
  
(We are watching a recording in progress. The Osgoods are sitting behind a
desk with a eighteen inch square box on it, making a video. The one on the
right has a 4th Doctor scarf looped around her neck. We'll call her Osgood 1.
The one on the left is wearing the 7th Doctors query motif pullover. Designate
her Osgood 2. One of the papers pinned to a notice board on the wall is a
headline - White House Appoints Alien Ambassador.)  
OSGOOD 2: Hello.  
OSGOOD 1: Hello. Do you want to?  
OSGOOD 2: No, you can, if you  
BOTH: Shall we do it together? Operation Double. The Zygon peace treaty.  
OSGOOD 2: I'm Osgood.  
OSGOOD 1: I'm also Osgood.  
OSGOOD 2: Remember that. It'll be important later.  
OSGOOD 1: Operation Double is a covert operation, outside of normal UNIT
strictures, to resettle and rehouse an alien race in secrecy on planet Earth.  
OSGOOD 2: With UNIT's help, twenty million Zygons have been allowed to take
human form, been dispersed around the world, and are now living amongst us.  
OSGOOD 1: We're making this in case something goes wrong. In case UNIT is
infiltrated. In case something occurs to unmask the Zygons.  
OSGOOD 2: Or in case one or both of us dies.  
(We are shown a cemetery, with an Osgood standing in front a black marble
headstone simply engraved My Sister, holding white flowers.)  
OSGOOD 1: The Zygons are a peaceful race.  
OSGOOD 2: Their shape-changing ability should not be considered a weapon.  
OSGOOD 1: It's a survival mechanism.  
OSGOOD 2: They embed themselves in other cultures, and live out their lives in
their new bodies in peace and harmony. Mainly.  
OSGOOD 1: Any race is capable of the best and the worst.  
OSGOOD 2: Every race is peaceful and warlike.  
OSGOOD 1: Good and evil.  
OSGOOD 2: My race is no exception.  
OSGOOD 1: And neither is mine.  
OSGOOD 2: If one Zygon goes rogue  
OSGOOD 1: Or one human  
OSGOOD 2: Then the ceasefire will break.  
(They put their hands on the box.)  
OSGOOD 2: That's why the Doctor left us this.  
OSGOOD 1: He called it the Osgood Box.  
OSGOOD 2: If you've been paying attention, you'll be able to guess why.  
OSGOOD 1: This is the last resort.  
OSGOOD 2: The final sanction.  
OSGOOD 1: Pray this box is never needed.  
OSGOOD 2: Because if it is, that means the ceasefire is breaking  
OSGOOD 1: And with twenty million shape-changing Zygons dispersed around the
world  
OSGOOD 2: That is the Nightmare Scenario.  
  
(In Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, an adobe building is the Police
Station. A woman runs for it as others unseen fire guns and shout a lot. It is
Osgood, this time in a 6th Doctor question mark on the shirt collar costume,
and brown Brigadier-style jumper. A bullet whizzes through the now open door
and breaks a glass. She tries another door, but it is locked, so she hides
under a desk and uses her inhaler before getting out her mobile phone. Before
she can dial, something with red rubbery skin walks in. Her finger hovers
email icon on her The Doctor T A R D I S Direct Link contact page, then she
presses send. The Zygon grabs her and pulls her out from under the desk, then
incapacitates her with a jolt of electricity to the forehead. Osgood drops her
phone. The time is 10:21.)  
  
**[Tardis]**  
  
(While Osgood's message is coming up on the scanner, the Doctor is playing
Amazing Grace on his electric guitar. He sees the words Nightmare Scenario
flashing.)  
  
**[Brockwell Park, London]**  
  
(A crocodile of school children are being escorted by two women teachers. The
Tardis is standing nearby and the Doctor is sitting on a swing in the
designated play area, using his mobile phone.)  
TEACHER: Come on, kids, no pushing!  
CLARA [OC]: Hi, this is Clara Oswald. I'm probably on the Tube or in outer
space. Leave a message! (beep)  
DOCTOR: Hello, it's Doctor Disco. I'm in the twenty first century. I don't
know what month. I'm staking out some of the most dangerous creatures
imaginable.  
(Two little girls stop and stare at him.)  
DOCTOR: Operating under deep cover. Trying not to attract suspicion. Give me a
call, Clara. Nightmare Scenario. I'm worried.  
(He follows the little girls to the monkey bars.)  
DOCTOR: Okay. Hey, Monster High and Cinderella. Down off the monkey bars.
Listen to me. We've got to talk.  
  
**[UNIT Safe House, South London]**  
  
(A grand old building with a For Sale or To Let sign outside. Downstairs, Kate
Lethbridge Stewart is giving orders.)  
KATE: Get me Colonel Walsh. And I need you to coordinate the Operation Double
locations.  
JAC: There are twenty million Zygons. And most of the data was with  
(Kate is holding a photograph of the two Osgoods.)  
JAC: Her.  
KATE: Do what you can. Start with any that have intelligence flags from the
past six months.  
(Beeps.)  
JAC: Walsh coming through.  
WALSH [OC]: Walsh. Turmezistan.  
KATE: Any new arrivals?  
(Walsh is a lady Red Beret.)  
WALSH [on screen]: One. The pictures aren't very good.  
(Kate puts on her glasses to see.)  
KATE: Can you zoom in on the prisoner?  
(Osgood is in manacles, being escorted by two Zygons.)  
KATE: It's her. (to Jac) Get into her files. We have to assume they've been
compromised.  
(Jac's tablet screen fills with Truth Or Consequences over and over again.)  
JAC: Er, too late. The encryption system's already been hacked. And they've
sent through another video.  
  
**[Brockwell Park]**  
  
(The Doctor is on the monkey bars with the serious two little girls..)  
DOCTOR: Look, I admire you, okay? I think you're ingenious. Pretending to be a
couple of seven year olds is a splendid way to conceal your blobbiness. But
let's not pretend. You're very blobby. In fact, you two are the big blobs. And
you are not patrolling the ceasefire.  
(The girls climb down, the Doctor goes down the slide.)  
DOCTOR: Fine. Fine, bury your heads. Listen to me. Listen! There are other
factions. I know that there are other blobby factions that you don't control.
They're planning something. And if we don't get together and stop it, it'll be
the end of this. Of all of you.  
JEMIMA: This is our jurisdiction, Doctor. These are our creatures. We are
close to finding them.  
CLAUDETTE: They are our children, and we will deal with them.  
DOCTOR: Your kids are out of control. I'm taking this out of your hands.  
(His phone rings.)  
DOCTOR: Don't even think about going anywhere.  
(He walks away to answer it.)  
DOCTOR: Are you phoning me with your backside again, or are you really sending
me a distress signal?  
KATE [OC]: I'm really sending you a distress signal.  
  
**[UNIT Safe House]**  
  
KATE: They've kidnapped Osgood and they've stolen the location of every Zygon
on Earth. Doctor, the ceasefire's broken down.  
  
**[Brockwell Park]**  
  
(Red gas is hissing from an alien canister.)  
DOCTOR: Hey! Away! Away! Get those kids out of the way! Out of the way! Out of
the way! Out of the way! Move! Out of the way!  
(The school children and their teachers flee. Zygons step through the gas to
grab Jemima and Claudette, who screams, and carry them away to a nearby Parks
Maintenance van, registration LR55 YOY. It leaves with a squeal of tyres so
the Doctor runs back to the Tardis, past a black three finger symbol on the
notice board.)  
  
**[UNIT Safe House]**  
  
(That same symbol, this time in white on a black background along with alien
lettering, is on the flag behind Osgood as she reads a prepared statement. She
is flanked by Zygons.)  
OSGOOD [on screen]: UNIT troops will be destroyed wherever they are in the
world. The enemies of our race will be destroyed wherever they are in the
world. The war is about to begin. There will be truth or there will be
consequences.  
(Message ends. The Doctor uses his phone.)  
CLARA [OC]: Hi, this is Clara Oswald. I'm probably on the Tube or in outer
space. Leave a message! (beep)  
DOCTOR: Call me now.  
  
**[Block of flats]**  
  
(Clara removes her helmet and gloves, and goes inside. Her phone bingles. The
Doctor 127 Missed Calls. She listens to one of the messages.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Hello, it's Doctor Disco.  
(Then she encounters a sad boy sitting on the stairs.)  
SANDEEP: Hello.  
CLARA: Oh, hello. Sandeep, hello. You okay?  
SANDEEP: I can't find my mummy and daddy.  
CLARA: Well, why don't you wait here, and I can go see if I can find them?  
  
**[Sandeep's flat]  
  
**(Clara walks into the flat at the end of the corridor. It is dark.)  
CLARA: Hello? Hello?  
(Suddenly Sandeep's father is standing behind her. She gasps.)  
CLARA: Oh! Sorry. Er, your little boy is out there. He couldn't find you.  
(The man walks out.)  
SANDEEP'S DAD [OC]: Daddy's here!  
(Then the mother walks in.)  
SANDEEP'S MUM: We can take him.  
(Sandeep is screaming as his father carries him in over his shoulder.)  
CLARA: Is, is he okay?  
SANDEEP'S MUM: Everything's fine.  
  
**[Block of flats]**  
  
(Clara leaves number 52, tying back her hair. The door slams behind her. She
gets out her phone and calls the Doctor.)  
CLARA: Did you just call yourself Doctor Disco?  
  
**[Drakeman Junio** **r School, Dulwich** **]**  
  
(A UNIT vehicle arrives, and the Doctor and Clara get out.)  
KATE: This is where the Zygon High Command had their secret base.  
CLARA: A junior school?  
(They go inside. Photographs of Jemima and Claudette are on a wall collage.)  
KATE: Terms of the settlement, Operation Double, were these. Twenty million
Zygons, the entire hatchery, were allowed to be born and to stay on Earth.
They were permitted to permanently take up the form of the nearest available
human beings.  
JAC: In this case, a large percentage of the population of the UK.  
  
**[Boiler room]**  
  
KATE: You left us with an impossible situation, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. It's called peace. What about the two little girl
commanders? Weren't they helping you?  
KATE: They've been almost impossible to deal with since Osgood left.
Secretive, uncommunicative. We've known there's something going on. Some
radicalisation, some revolution in the younger brood. They said they had it
under control.  
  
**[Command centre]**  
  
(They go through a hole in the brick wall to an area festooned with red cords
or cables. A giant sized polyp stands proud.)  
DOCTOR: The Zygon command centre. That's the control polyp for all Zygons on
Earth.  
JAC: It's horrible.  
DOCTOR: Could you? Would you mind? Thank you.  
(Clara takes his torch. He splashes liquid from the pool in the centre of the
polyp onto its fronds, then caresses some horns.)  
DOCTOR: If this has been compromised, the Zygons are wide open. They'll be
starting to panic. Starting to worry.  
CLARA: Doctor, do you want to be alone with that thing?  
DOCTOR: It's a command computer. You operate it by titivating the fronds.  
CLARA: Are you enjoying that?  
DOCTOR: I snogged a Zygon once. Old habits.  
(Screens come to life, booting up with Sapphire.)  
DOCTOR: Still got the old magic.  
CLARA: So, Osgood's been kidnapped, right? I thought Osgood was dead.  
KATE: There've always been two of her, ever since the ceasefire. We never knew
which one was real.  
DOCTOR: Both of them.  
KATE: Okay, which one was Zygon.  
DOCTOR: Both of them. They would have maintained a live link. They were both
Zygon and human at the same time. They not only administered the peace, they
_were_ the peace.  
JAC: When the other Osgood died, the survivor went pretty much mad with grief.
Then she just disappeared. Went undercover in the States. Now, of course, the
rebels have her.  
DOCTOR: Ah ha! Okay. Zygons hatched and dispersed all over, but something's
gone wrong. Mexico border, North Asia, West Africa, Australia. Panic.
Paranoia. What would happen if they knew who we were?  
(Beep.)  
JAC: We've received another video.  
(They gather round Jac's tablet.)  
KATE: That's the Zygon High Command. It's Jemima and Claudette.  
ZYGON [OC]: We have been betrayed. We were sold. Our rights were violated. We
demand the right to be ourselves. Normalise. Normalise!  
(Jemima and Claudette transform into Zygons, then are zapped to dust by
electricity from two other Zygon hands.)  
ZYGON [on screen]: We are now the Zygon High Command. All traitors will die.
Truth or consequences.  
(Message ends.)  
DOCTOR: So, we have a Zygon revolution on our hands. We need to open
negotiations.  
KATE: I'm not negotiating with them. As far as they're concerned, everyone's a
traitor.  
CLARA: If you're not going to negotiate, what are you going to do?  
KATE: They're holed up in this settlement in Turmezistan. It's where they've
taken Osgood. I'm going to order Colonel Walsh to bomb it.  
DOCTOR: Isn't there a solution that doesn't involve bombing everyone?  
KATE: The treaty's been comprehensively violated, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: This is a splinter group. The rest of the Zygons, the vast majority,
they want to live in peace. You start bombing them, you'll radicalise the lot.
That's exactly what the splinter group wants.  
JAC: Truth or consequences. What exactly does that mean?  
KATE: It's just the usual kind of nonsense these idiots call themselves.  
CLARA: It's in New Mexico.  
KATE: What?  
CLARA: It's a town in New Mexico. Truth or Consequences. Er, they renamed it
after a TV show, for a bet or something. It's a Trivial Pursuit question. I
used to memorise Trivial Pursuit questions so I could win.  
KATE: That's the last place we received signal from Osgood's phone, isn't it?
New Mexico.  
DOCTOR: Okay. Kate Stewart, no bombs for you. Go to Truth Or Consequences. See
what you can find out. The Doctor will go to Turmezistan. Negotiate peace,
rescue Osgood, and prevent this war, cos that's what he does. Clara, Jac, you
stay here. This is your country. Protect it from the scary monsters. And also
from the Zygons.  
CLARA: Fine.  
DOCTOR: Oh, and do you still have the presidential aircraft?  
CLARA: I thought you didn't like being President of the World.  
DOCTOR: No, but I like poncing about in a big plane.  
  
**[Airport tarmac]**  
  
(Night. The Doctor poses on the steps then goes inside his aeroplane. Kate and
Clara walk away.)  
CLARA: How many troops do you have?  
KATE: Not many. Usually on bigger cases we can draft in from the regular army.
We can't do that now. The secrecy of the project has to be maintained.  
CLARA: You got any snazzy weapons?  
KATE: There was an attempted Zygon invasion before, in the seventies,
eighties. One of our staff was a naval surgeon. Worked at Porton Down on the
captured Zygons. Developed Zee-67. It's a nerve gas. Unravels their DNA.
Basically turns them inside out.  
CLARA: Where do you keep it?  
KATE: We don't. It was taken. The formula, the lot.  
CLARA: Who took it?  
KATE: Somebody with a Tardis.  
JAC: They're ready for you, ma'am.  
KATE: (to Clara) Keep in touch.  
(Kate is driven away.)  
CLARA: Oh, I just need to swing by home and grab a couple of things.  
JAC: Yeah, course.  
  
**[Block of flats]**  
  
(Clara closes the door to flat 64, which looks to be directly above flat 52\.
She and Jac are walking down the stairs when they hear -)  
SANDEEP'S DAD: Quick, before someone sees us.  
(Sandeep's parents are dragging a large bundle to the lift. Clara and Jac
watch them put it inside, then hear Sandeep call out. The lift door closes and
it goes down.)  
CLARA: It's really slow. We can catch them. Come on!  
(Jac and Clara stand outside the lift on the ground floor as it creaks and
groans.)  
CLARA: It's slower than usual.  
JAC: What's wrong with it?  
(The lift doors open. It is empty.)  
JAC: Is there a cellar, or somewhere else they could have gone?  
CLARA: No.  
  
**[Lift]**  
  
(They step inside and the doors close. Slime dribbles down the control panel.)  
JAC: Ugh, what is that?  
(The front of the control panel pops loose. Clara opens it to reveal Zygon
style controls.)  
JAC: No, don't.  
(Clara touches the controls. The lights go out and the lift drops, shaking
violently. Clara turns on the light on her phone. Then the lift stops and the
doors open.  
  
**[Tunnel]**  
  
(They step out into a huge tunnel. Sandeep is calling out in the distance.
Shadowy figures with torches are carrying things in the distance. Clara and
Jac press themselves against the wall of the tunnel.)  
CLARA: I think we need to get some reinforcements.  
(They tiptoe back to the lift.)  
  
**[UNIT Command Base, Turmezistan]  
  
**(A spectacular snowcapped mountain dominates the skyline. Two Land Rovers
are let through a check point. They drive past some soldiers fitting missiles
to drone aircraft registration 1028.  
Inside, an American woman is controlling an attack drone in flight.)  
LISA: Approaching target at 1-00-65-12. Confirm strike order  
WALSH: Order confirmed.  
DOCTOR: At ease. I'm the President of the World. I'm here to rescue people and
generally establish happiness all over the place. The Doctor. Doctor
Funkenstein.  
WALSH: Yes, we know who you are.  
LISA: Going to strike altitude.  
DOCTOR: What's going on here? Fun and games?  
PILOT [OC]: We're seven hundred metres lower, seven hundred metres lower than
planned. Over.  
DOCTOR: You're not bombing that town. That's where they're holding my friend.  
WALSH: They're dangerous. And your friend is almost certainly dead. I'm not
going to allow them to disperse. You can't track a shape-shifter.  
LISA: Visual on the target.  
WALSH: Confirm strike.  
DOCTOR: Colonel.  
WALSH: Confirm strike.  
(But Lisa is looking at the image on her screen, and seeing a man and boy
waving at her.)  
WALSH: Confirm strike.  
(The same man and boy in the photograph on her console. The Doctor sees it
too.)  
WALSH: Confirm strike. Confirm strike!  
LISA: Strike aborted. Strike aborted.  
DOCTOR: Well, that's interesting.  
  
**[Sheriff's Office]**  
  
(The black Chevrolet Tahoe leaves Business 25 at exit 79, one mile from Truth
or Consequences and heads into the sleepy town in New Mexico, USA. The Zygon
rebel symbol is present here, on the painted Mexican-style buildings. There
are no signs of life apart from some tumbleweed. Kate stops, gets out and
walks over to a sign on a wall - No Dogs - to which the words No British have
been added. She is watched as she checks her map then takes out her gun before
walking to the same Police Station that Osgood ran into. The place is a mess.)  
KATE: Hello? Hello?  
(She puts her gun away and looks at the notice board by the desk that Osgood
had hidden beneath. There is a photograph of Osgood at a gas station. A
policewoman points her gun at Kate and cocks it.)  
NORLANDER: You one of them?  
KATE: I'm a friend. I've come to help.  
NORLANDER: Alone? Have you come to help alone?  
KATE: What happened here?  
NORLANDER: You must have brought backup. Where's your backup? Tell me!  
KATE: First, tell me why I need it.  
  
**[UNIT Command Base, Turmezistan]**  
  
(Loading up the Land Rovers.)  
WALSH: We think it's a Zygon training camp. We never see more than one or two
of them outside at any one time. But they always take different shapes, we
don't know how many there really are. We don't know how they come and go.
Whether they go through tunnels, or whether they turn into dogs and run out
across the hills.  
DOCTOR: So, that's what we'll find out.  
WALSH: We should have that gas. We should be able to rip them inside out.  
DOCTOR: Colonel, take it easy. They're trying to unsettle you. They're trying
to make you paranoid and panicked.  
WALSH: Any living thing in this world, including my family and friends, could
turn into a Zygon and kill me, any second now. It's not paranoia when it's
real.  
  
**[UNIT Safe House]**  
  
(The weapons are being handed out to the troops.)  
JAC: I've been looking into this. There have been reports all over London of
strange activity in lifts. I've patched into CCTV from Scotland Yard. All the
elevators I can find. Now, this is SOAS. People dragging bundles. They go
down, down, down, down, down, down. A few minutes go by, and then  
(The screen flickers, goes black, then the lights come back on and the lift is
empty.)  
JAC: They're all gone. There is something very wrong happening underneath
London.  
  
**[Sher** **iff's Office** **]**  
  
(Norlander downs a cup of water. Kate is perusing files. The digital clock on
the wall says it is Thu 1, 11:01)  
NORLANDER: The Brits came two years ago. We didn't want them. They just They
just turned up. No jobs. Nowhere to live. No money. And they were, they were
odd. They started getting into fights. Couple of them got killed.  
KATE: More than a couple. What happened here?  
NORLANDER: After the murders, they started banding together. And then, one
day, one of them changed.  
KATE: Changed?  
NORLANDER: One of them was walking down West Main, and suddenly, it turned
into a, a reptile.  
(Kate finds a sketch of a Zygon.)  
NORLANDER: They just came for us. They turned into monsters and they _came_
for us. And, and we couldn't fight them. You can't tell who's who. They can
turn your own family against you.  
(Kate calls up a photo on her phone.)  
KATE: Have you seen her?  
NORLANDER: Yeah, she was here. She was at the motel, asking questions. Before.  
(It is Osgood.)  
NORLANDER: Everybody's gone.  
KATE: Where?  
  
WALSH [OC]: Okay, listen carefully. Once we get to the village we have a
thirty minute window before the airstrike.  
  
**[Zygon Occupied Village, Turmezistan]**  
  
(A small village with a church rather than a mosque.)  
WALSH: We all know what a rabbit warren this place is, but we've got intel
they're holed up inside the church. Hitchley, you take the front, storm it,
draw their fire. The Doctor and I will take the back.  
(The Doctor holds out a photo of Osgood.)  
DOCTOR: This is our object. We need to get her back, safely. Try to kill as
few of them as possible. I need have to have someone to negotiate with.  
WALSH: You know what they're capable of. Do not fall victim to it. Truck open.
Code Green.  
HITCHLEY: Let's move out!  
  
**[Outside the church]**  
  
(Walsh and the Doctor go through the graveyard to the back of the church. At
the front, Hitchley fires three shots into the air.)  
HITCHLEY: Come out! Throw down your weapons! Come out! We have you surrounded!
_Come out of there_!  
(No movement.)  
HITCHLEY: Come out, we have you surrounded!  
(The carved church door opens and an old woman comes out.)  
HITCHLEY'S MUM: I don't have any weapons. Please.  
HITCHLEY: Take aim. On my command.  
HITCHLEY'S MUM: No. No, don't, please. Johnny, you don't understand.  
HITCHLEY: You're not my mother. Don't use my name.  
HITCHLEY'S MUM: They took us here. They came to the house and took us. They
took your sister. Me.  
(She starts to walk down the steps.)  
HITCHLEY: Stay where you are.  
HITCHLEY'S MUM: It's not us who are the impostors. Don't let them trick you.
It's your commanders, your chief. They're the aliens.  
WALSH [OC]: Do not fall victim.  
  
**[Behind the church]**  
  
WALSH: Ask for details. She's a copy. Ask something  
  
**[Outside the church]**  
  
WALSH [OC]: Only your mum could know.  
HITCHLEY: Mom, I'm going to have to ask you some questions.  
HITCHLEY'S MUM: Don't do this. You know it's me. Don't let them trick you.  
HITCHLEY: Date and place of my birth.  
HITCHLEY'S MUM: They brought us here. They're using us against you. I'm
scared. Please, I'm so scared.  
HITCHLEY: Name of my favourite teddy bear.  
HITCHLEY'S MUM: I don't remember. I'm sorry, I don't.  
  
**[Behind the church]**  
  
HITCHLEY'S MUM [OC]: Don't kill me because I can't remember!  
WALSH: Hitchley!  
  
**[Outside the church]**  
  
(More people come out of the church. The soldiers start to lower their weapons
as they recognise them.)  
HITCHLEY: Stay back! All of you, stay back from them!  
  
**[Be** **hind the church** **]**  
  
WALSH: That is not your mother. It is an alien hostile.  
  
**[Outside the church]**  
  
HITCHLEY'S MUM: We're not those creatures. We're hostages.  
  
**[Be** **hind the church** **]**  
  
WALSH: Kill it!  
HITCHLEY'S MUM [OC]: I can prove it.  
  
**[Outside the church]**  
  
(She is almost within reach of her son.)  
HITCHLEY'S MUM: I can prove who we are. Just come inside, I'll show you.  
  
**[Behind the church]**  
  
WALSH: Don't go in there.  
  
**[Outside the church]**  
  
HITCHLEY'S MUM: Please.  
HITCHLEY: You're not my mom.  
HITCHLEY'S MUM: Oh, God, you're going to kill me.  
HITCHLEY: Mom, please.  
HITCHLEY'S MUM: You are. You're going to kill me. I love you. I forgive you
and I love you.  
  
**[Behind the church]**  
  
WALSH: Do it!  
  
**[Outside the church]**  
  
(The soldiers all raise their weapons again. Hitchley's mum closes her eyes,
then Hitchley lowers his gun. He is nearly crying.)  
HITCHLEY: What proof?  
  
**[Behind the church]**  
  
WALSH: Don't go in there. You're going to your death!  
  
**[Outside t** **he church** **]**  
  
WALSH [OC]: Hitchley, kill it.  
HITCHLEY: Let's go. Over and out, ma'am.  
(The soldiers follow their relatives into the church.)  
  
**[Behind the church]**  
  
WALSH: Damn it. _Damn it_!  
DOCTOR: This is pointless! Just let me go in and talk!  
(They run round the church. Walsh shoots the lock off a side door.)  
  
**[Church]**  
  
(Walsh and the Doctor enter a room with a strategy table laid out. There are
sets of hairy bundles on the floor, still sizzling with electricity.)  
WALSH: They've executed my men.  
DOCTOR: Where are the Zygons?  
WALSH: We need to bomb the hell out of this place. It's _infested_ with these
things. We can't tell who the enemy is any more, we can't count them and we
can't track them!  
DOCTOR: I'm not going to let you do that.  
WALSH: I just lost my men, I'll quite happily bomb the hell out of anywhere.
We need to move. Strike's on its way.  
DOCTOR: I need to find Osgood.  
WALSH: You've got ten minutes.  
(Walsh leaves. The Doctor is looking at the coloured blocks on the table when
-)  
OSGOOD [OC]: Help! Help!  
DOCTOR: Osgood! Osgood!  
(He stamps on the floor, looking for a trap door.)  
OSGOOD [OC]: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Osgood!  
OSGOOD [OC]: Doctor, I'm here!  
DOCTOR: Osgood!  
OSGOOD [OC]: Doctor, I'm down here!  
DOCTOR: Osgood!  
OSGOOD [OC]: Doctor!  
(He finds the trap door under a carpet in either a cupboard or a small
corridor.)  
  
**[Basement]**  
  
OSGOOD: Doctor! Doctor!  
(The Doctor jumps down the ladder. and turns on a torch.)  
DOCTOR: Osgood!  
(A jet flies overhead. He finds her sitting, manacled.)  
DOCTOR: Got to get you out. They're going to bomb this place. What do the
Zygons want?  
OSGOOD: They're training, practising new skills. Doctor, what are you doing
here?  
(He sonicks her manacles.)  
DOCTOR: Rescuing you. In quite a dashing way, I might add.  
OSGOOD: They fled through the tunnels. They're going back to the UK. If you're
here, they've got you out of the way. Who's left in the UK?  
DOCTOR: Clara.  
ZYGON: Clara!  
DOCTOR: Oh, hello.  
(Whee Boom! Rocks fall on top of the Zygon.)  
DOCTOR: They've started. So much for ten minutes.  
(Boom!)  
  
**[Truth or Consequences]**  
  
KATE: You found something? What? What do you want me to see?  
(Norlander opens a dumpster full of hair and sizzling electricity.)  
KATE: Oh, God. W-were those all people?  
(Sizzling sounds are coming from more dumpsters nearby.)  
  
**[Tunnel]**  
  
(A lift arrives. Jac, Clara and some soldiers get out.)  
JAC: It's an odd world nowadays, isn't it?  
CLARA: It's always been an odd world.  
JAC: Mmm. I mean, doesn't it feel, sometimes, that things are coming to an
end? Everything's just going nuts.  
CLARA: You're middle-aged, that's what it is. No offence. Everybody middle-
aged always thinks the world's about to come to an end. Hmm. Never does. It's
here. Oh, my God.  
(Lots of Zygon tech.)  
  
**[Aeroplane]**  
  
The Zygon is wheeled in tied to a box trolley. The Doctor follows, on his
phone.)  
CLARA [OC]: Hi, this is Clara Oswald. I'm probably on the tube or in outer
space. Leave a message!  
DOCTOR: Can you change your voicemail message, please, it's getting very
boring.  
(Osgood is behind him and sits down.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, I see you've accessorised it.  
OSGOOD: Yes.  
DOCTOR: The old question marks.  
OSGOOD: You used to wear question marks.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I know, yes, I did.  
OSGOOD: They were nice. Why don't you wear them any more?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I do. I've got question mark underpants.  
OSGOOD: Makes one wonder what the question is.  
(The Doctor pulls up another chair and sits down.)  
DOCTOR: Which one are you? Human or Zygon?  
OSGOOD: I don't answer that question.  
DOCTOR: Why not?  
OSGOOD: Because there isn't a question to answer. I don't accept it. My sister
and I were the living embodiment of the peace we made. I will give all the
lives that I have to protect it. You want to know who I am, Doctor? I am the
peace. I am Human _and_ Zygon.  
DOCTOR: Like a hybrid.  
OSGOOD: A hybrid, if you like.  
DOCTOR: Well, I'm proud to know you, Osgood. And I promise that I won't tell
anyone that you're a human. Zygons need to keep the human original alive to
refresh the body print. If you were a Zygon, you'd've changed back within days
of your sister's death.  
OSGOOD: Those were the old rules, before Zygons could pluck loved ones from
your memory and wear their faces. Zygons only need to keep the original alive
if they need more information from them. If the interrogation is over, then
the original can die.  
  
**[Tunnel]**  
  
(Faces illuminatied by red light.)  
JAC: Oh, my God. These are Zygon pods.  
(Lots of large scaley things attached to the roof and walls.)  
CLARA: I think you might be right.  
JAC: About what?  
CLARA: The end of the world.  
  
**[Aeroplane]**  
  
(In the air. The Zygon roars.)  
DOCTOR: Bit of first-things-first-ness. What's your name? My name's. Well, you
can call me the Doctor. But then you knew that, didn't you? You want
something. What is it?  
ZYGON: You are the President of the World?  
DOCTOR: I suppose so.  
ZYGON: We want the world.  
(The Zygons laughs.)  
  
**[Tunnel]**  
  
(Troops march in from the lift.)  
CLARA: Okay. It looks like whole buildings full of people have been pinched.
In fact, it looks like a whole London full of people have been pinched. But
we've got here early, they're still growing. We've have to neutralise these
before they hatch. Take your positions.  
(Gun bolts slide.)  
CLARA: Do you know what? I'm enjoying this.  
JAC: Clara.  
CLARA: What?  
JAC: We don't know that's what these are.  
CLARA: Oh, come on. These are eggs, or pods, or whatever. Look.  
(She pulls the membrane from one pod 'window'.)  
CLARA: Oh, my God, that's me.  
JAC: I think we should wait.  
CLARA: Look, they're here. They're growing duplicates of us. We have to
destroy them. I've seen this happen before. It happened to that little boy.
They took his parents and then they took him.  
JAC: But I don't see how these _are_ __duplicates. That's not how Zygons work.
They don't grow duplicates, _they_ __kidnap the originals. So these, these
_are_ __the humans. Retreat. Retreat! This is a trap! This is an ambush!  
(A large number of Zygons are there. Clara is calm and smiling slightly.)  
JAC: No. Oh, no, Miss Oswald, please. Please!  
CLARA: Kill the traitors.  
(Lots of screaming while Clara recalls what happened in Sandeep's flat.)  
CLARA [memory]: Is he okay?  
(A Zygon stood behind Sandeep's Mum and zapped Clara, then her duplicate
appeared.)  
CLARA-Z [memory]: Hello, Clara. My name is Bonnie.  
(The UNIT troops have been reduced to hairballs.)  
  
**[A** **eroplane** **]**  
  
ZYGON: We want the truth of who we are to be acknowledged. We want to live as
ourselves. At any cost. We want a home.  
DOCTOR: Well, you can't have the United Kingdom. There's already people living
there. They'll think you're going to pinch their benefits.  
ZYGON: We're already there, Doctor. The invasion's already taken place, bit by
bit, over the last year. We've won the first battle. And now, we are going to
begin the war.  
  
**[Sheriff's Office]**  
  
(Kate is going through more files when Norlander comes in. It is night, 11.01
according to the clock. Insects are chirping.)  
NORLANDER: There's hundreds more. They killed everybody.  
KATE: We have to find out what forms they took, how many of them there were.
How did this happen?  
NORLANDER: Somebody once caught the briefest of glimpses of a Zygon in its
proper form. A child who hadn't learned to preserve its body print, who had
been left alone to learn these things for itself. And then word went round
these primitives that we were monsters.  
KATE: We?  
NORLANDER: There isn't any backup, is there? I just had to be sure.  
(Norlander transforms into a Zygon and reaches for Kate. In the UNIT safe
house, Zygon-Clara is making a call.)  
CLARA-Z [OC]: Commander calling Truth or Consequences. What is your status?
Repeat, Commander calling Truth or Consequences. What is your status?  
(Presumably the Kate who uses Zygon tech to reply is a Zygon, but we cannot be
sure.)  
KATE-Z: Commander, UNIT neutralised in North America. Truth or Consequences.  
  
**[UNIT Safe House]**  
  
CLARA-Z: Copy that.  
(She goes to the armoury and unlocks it, and takes a case from a rack. Then
she logs into the computer and uses her phone.)  
CLARA-Z: Bonnie speaking. UNIT neutralised in the UK. More or less.  
(The screen shows the position of the Doctor's plane returning to the UK.
Clara-Z watches it from a cliff top and makes a call.)  
  
**[Aeroplane]**  
  
ZYGON: Answer it. Say goodbye. This plane will never land.  
DOCTOR: Really. Clara?  
  
**[Cliff top]**  
  
CLARA-Z: Doctor.  
  
**[Aeroplane]**  
DOCTOR: Clara?  
  
**[Cliff top]**  
  
CLARA-Z: There you are.  
(The case contains a missile launcher. She puts her phone on speaker and takes
it out to target the aeroplane.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Clara, I'm glad you're okay. Listen.  
CLARA-Z: You're breaking up.  
DOCTOR [OC]: The invasion has happened. You're probably surrounded by Zygons.
Get to the Tardis, get yourself safe.  
  
**[Aeroplane]**  
  
DOCTOR: And apparently my plane is never going to land, but let's see what
we're going to do about that.  
  
**[Cliff top]**  
  
CLARA-Z: I'm sorry, but Clara's dead.  
  
**[Aeroplane]  
  
**CLARA-Z [OC]: Kate Stewart is dead. The UNIT troops are all dead.  
  
**[Cliff top]**  
  
CLARA-Z: Truth or consequences.  
(She fires the missile and it appears to lock on to the plane.)  
  
**[Aeroplane]**  
  
DOCTOR: Clara!  
(Offscreen explosion.)
