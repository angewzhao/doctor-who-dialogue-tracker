**Time Flight**  
  
Original Airdate: 22 Mar, 1982  

__**Part One**__

**[Flight deck]**

(Speedbird - aka Concorde, the pride of British Airways - is in flight.)  
URQUHART: This is Captain Urquhart again.

**[Passenger cabin]**

URQUHART [OC]: We're still travelling supersonic, ladies and gentlemen, fifty
seven thousand feet. Just to let you know that we'll be reaching our
deceleration point in a few minutes

**[Flight deck]**

URQUHART: And beginning our descent into London Heathrow.  
(He switches channels.)  
URQUHART: Good afternoon, London. Speedbird Concorde one nine two.

**[Air Traffic Control]**

HORTON: Speedbird Concorde one nine two. You are cleared to descent to flight
level three seven zero.  
URQUHART [OC]: Roger. Clear to three seven zero.

**[Flight deck]**

PILOT: Mach one point six. Sixty miles to subsonic point. We're spot on.  
URQUHART: Speedbird Concorde one nine two level at three seven zero.

**[Air Traffic Control]**

HORTON: Speedbird Concorde one nine two, you are cleared to continue descent
to two eight zero. Speedbird Concorde one nine two, will you acknowledge,
please?  
URQUHART [OC]: Speedbird Concorde one nine two. Speedbird Concorde one nine
two.  
HORTON: Speedbird Concorde one nine two, will you acknowledge?

**[Passenger cabin]**

(The stewardess is clearing up the passenger's trays.)  
ANGELA: Can I take your glass?

**[Air Traffic Control]**

HORTON: Speedbird Concorde one nine two, will you acknowledge, please.  
(He picks up a telephone.)  
HORTON: I have total RT breakdown on Speedbird Concorde one nine two.  
(A few moments later, his supervisor is at his elbow.)  
HORTON: I don't believe it. She's approaching London but the trace is becoming
intermittent.

**[Concorde in flight]**

ANGELA [OC]: Ladies and gentlemen. In a few minutes we shall be arriving at
London T  
(Concorde quietly vanishes from the skies.)

**[Air Traffic Control]**

(The radar blip tagged GBAVF vanishes from the screen. Horton picks up the red
telephone.)  
HORTON: Emergency. We have lost contact with Concorde Golf Victor Foxtrot.

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor closes the outer doors. Everyone is very sombre.)  
DOCTOR: Crew of the freighter safely returned to their own time.  
NYSSA: Cyber fleet dispersed.  
TEGAN: Oh, great. You make it sound like a shopping list, ticking off things
as you go. Aren't you forgetting something rather important? Adric is dead.  
NYSSA: Tegan, please.  
DOCTOR: We feel his loss as well.  
TEGAN: Well, you could do more than grieve. You could go back.  
NYSSA: Could you?  
DOCTOR: No.  
NYSSA: But surely the Tardis is quite capable of  
TEGAN: We can change what happened if we materialise before Adric was killed.  
DOCTOR: And change your own history?  
TEGAN: Look, the freighter could still crash into Earth. That doesn't have to
be changed. Only Adric doesn't have to be on board.  
DOCTOR: Now listen to me, both of you. There are some rules that cannot be
broken even with the Tardis. Don't ever ask me to do anything like that again.
You must accept that Adric is dead. His life wasn't wasted. He died trying to
save others, just like his brother, Varsh. You know, Adric had a choice. This
is the way he wanted it.  
TEGAN: We used to fight a lot. I'll miss him.  
NYSSA: So will I.  
DOCTOR: And me. But he wouldn't want us to mourn unnecessarily.  
NYSSA: Where are we going?  
DOCTOR: Special treat to cheer us all up.  
NYSSA: 1851, Earth, London. What's so special about that, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Hyde Park, the Crystal Palace.  
TEGAN: 1851. The Great Exhibition?  
DOCTOR: All the wonders of Victorian science and technology.  
TEGAN: Well, the Tardis should feel at home.  
DOCTOR: How about opening day? Pass the time of day with the foreign royals.
We could even drop in at Lords, see a few overs from Wisden and Pilch. I
wonder if the Lion will be bowling?  
TEGAN: Let's get there first.  
DOCTOR: Yes, all right.  
(The Tardis lurches and keeps shaking.)  
DOCTOR: Nyssa, have you touched the dimensional stabilisers?  
NYSSA: Of course not. All systems functioning normally.  
DOCTOR: It could be the relative drift compensator.  
NYSSA: No.  
TEGAN: Some sort of turbulence?  
DOCTOR: Feedback from the solar comparator? No.  
NYSSA: Another ship.  
DOCTOR: Another ship? What do you mean, another ship?  
NYSSA: If it builds up at this frequency, it could draw us into spatial
convergence. We must materialise immediately.  
TEGAN: But we're due to land in London in a few minutes.  
DOCTOR: If we don't materialise, the Tardis will be destroyed.

**[Air Traffic Control]**

HORTON: Look at this. Something's just manifested. The same flight path as one
nine two. No transponder signal. Smaller than Golf Victor Foxtrot.
Unidentified aircraft on approach to one zero left, will you acknowledge?  
( _Fire trucks and an ambulance are dispatched to the runway._ The Tardis
hangs in midair above the tarmac.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Seems to have done the trick.  
NYSSA: Where are we?  
DOCTOR: Somewhere above Hyde Park. The view should be spectacular.  
(He turns on the scanner. Oops.)  
TEGAN: That's not Hyde Park, that's Heathrow Airport!  
DOCTOR: You're right.  
(The Doctor turns off the scanner.)  
TEGAN: Well, I never thought I'd say this, but let's get out of here! We could
be in the path of an oncoming aircraft.  
(The Doctor ducks under the console.)  
NYSSA: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Coordinate override. A sort of anti-collision device.  
(The Tardis dematerialises.)

**[Air Traffic Control]**

HORTON: It's gone. It must have been a light aircraft.

**[Terminal One]**

(A passenger loads their luggage onto a trolley.)  
TANNOY: Air Australia apologises for the delay to all flights, which is due to
weather conditions at Heathrow.  
(The Tardis materialises in front of a 'History of Aviation' mural.)

**[Tardis]**

TEGAN: You've landed us right in the middle of a Terminal building.  
DOCTOR: So I have.  
TEGAN: The authorities'll go mad.  
DOCTOR: Well, we'll only be here a moment. I hope.  
(A security officer looks at the Tardis on the upper level, and speaks into
his walkie-talkie.)  
TEGAN: Please hurry.  
DOCTOR: I am. Ah!  
TEGAN: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I won't be a moment.  
(The Doctor rushes out of the Tardis.)  
TEGAN: Doctor!  
NYSSA: At least we won't be noticed.  
TEGAN: What do you mean, because this is a police box?  
NYSSA: Well, this is Earth. For once it's a perfect camouflage.  
TEGAN: This is the 1980s, Nyssa. Police boxes went out with flower power.  
(The girls follow the Doctor.)

**[Terminal One]**

TEGAN: Oh, no.  
(The Doctor has obtained a newspaper.)  
DOCTOR: I don't know what English cricket is coming to.  
NYSSA: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
NYSSA: Doctor!  
(The Doctor looks up from the sports pages to see the security office
approaching with two of his colleagues and a pair of policemen.)

**[Office]**

(The man in charge of the Airport is on the telephone.)  
SHEARD: _A police box?_ I've just lost a complete complement of passengers and
crew, not to mention thirty million pounds worth of aircraft! As if I want to
know about a police box in Terminal One.  
ANDREWS: There isn't a police box in Terminal One.  
SHEARD: Landside security's your problem, Jim.  
ANDREWS: Not to mention all those VIPs waiting for the arrival of one nine two
in Terminal Three. (takes telephone) Andrews?  
SHEARD: Now, Mister Horton, we need you to explain to us exactly what you saw
on the radar screen when Victor Foxtrot began the deceleration procedure.  
ANDREWS: That's not possible. What? I'll be right over. Something very odd
going on in Terminal One.  
(leaves)  
SHEARD: Yes, now you lost contact with the aircraft over the Bristol Channel,
here.  
HORTON: Yes, the RT started to break up and the transponder signal just faded
from the screen.

**[Terminal One]**

(Andrews walks up to the Doctor.)  
ANDREWS: Are you responsible for this box, sir?  
DOCTOR: Well, I try to be.  
(Andrews confers with a colleague.)  
NYSSA: Doctor, you've done it again.  
DOCTOR: Nonsense. We'll be away from here in no time.  
ANDREWS: Would you be so good as to open it up, sir?  
DOCTOR: Is that a good idea?  
ANDREWS: I must insist, sir. Security.  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Security.  
ANDREWS: You have the key, sir?  
DOCTOR: UNIT.  
ANDREWS: Sir?  
DOCTOR: You'd do much better to check with UNIT, department C19. Sir John
Sudbury is the man you want.  
ANDREWS: And who exactly are you, sir?  
DOCTOR: Oh, just tell him it's the Doctor. And do send my regards to Brigadier
Lethbridge Stewart. Unless, of course, he's a General by now.  
(Andrews uses his colleague's walkie-talkie.)  
DOCTOR: You see? What did I say. We'll be gone in a couple of shakes.

**[Office]**

HORTON: Now, we've established there was no radar malfunction.  
SUPERVISOR: Well, of course we've been in search with Search and Rescue, and
as it happens there is a NATO exercise on in this area. But Naval Intelligence
assure us that far from crashing, no aircraft even broke cloud cover.  
(Sheard is making the telephone call.)  
SHEARD: A doctor with a police box. Really, Sir John, I hardly. Yes, yes, of
course I appreciate the political ramifications, but  
(Andrews returns.)  
SHEARD: Yes, but surely that's all the more reason for not wasting time with
this doctor. Yes, I. Yes, I beg your pardon. Of course, if you insist, Sir
John.  
(Sheard puts the telephone down.)  
ANDREWS: The party with the police box in Terminal One have full security
clearance from C19.  
SHEARD: That was UNIT. We are obliged to brief this doctor on the
disappearance of Victor Foxtrot. _Jim, I've had these Whitehall jokers up to
here.  
ANDREWS: So long as Concorde is missing, I suppose we shall have to put up
with them._

**[Outside the office]**

(The Doctor is trying to do the crossword.)  
TEGAN: It's always the same with you. Whenever we stop anywhere, you have to
get involved.  
DOCTOR: Be quiet, I'm thinking.  
TEGAN: We were supposed to be going to the Great Exhibition.  
DOCTOR: Well, we will, eventually.  
NYSSA: That's all you ever say.  
TEGAN: You promised.  
DOCTOR: Look, Tegan, this is your planet. I would have thought you wanted to
help.  
TEGAN: I am helping, by wanting to leave the recovery of Concorde to the
experts.  
DOCTOR: Well, I might be able to help.  
TEGAN: That's what worries me.

**[Office]**

DOCTOR: Good afternoon, gentlemen.  
SHEARD: Good heavens!  
ANDREWS: Ah, yes, this is the Doctor.  
SHEARD: Oh, ah. Oh, er, how do you do, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Hello. And this is Nyssa and Tegan.  
SHEARD: Oh. Oh, you're a stewardess.  
TEGAN: That's right.  
DOCTOR: Now, I believe you're having problems with Concorde.  
SHEARD: Er, tell the, er, Doctor, would you, please?  
HORTON: Well, this morning's Concorde flight from New York disappeared from
the radar just after its deceleration.  
DOCTOR: Disappeared?  
HORTON: Yes, it just faded from the screen.  
TEGAN: It didn't crash?  
HORTON: It was flying on a level course, all systems were working normally.  
DOCTOR: Indeed. I wonder.  
TEGAN: Wonder what?  
DOCTOR: Remember the turbulence we experienced?  
TEGAN: That forced us to materialise?  
DOCTOR: Yes. I wonder very much indeed.  
NYSSA: It sounds as if it could be cross-tracing on the time-space axis.  
DOCTOR: Exactly.  
SHEARD: Are you saying you know where the missing aircraft is?  
DOCTOR: I suspect it's not a question of where, but er, when.

**[Heathrow Airport]**

(Two BA pilots walk up to another Concorde through a covering of snow.)  
BILTON: Any idea what these tests are for, Skipper?  
STAPLEY: All I know is, some scientist wants to take up some special equipment
to monitor the approach used by Victor Foxtrot when she went through the
deceleration phase.  
SCOBIE: Morning, Skipper. All ready for loading.  
STAPLEY: Is the gear on its way?  
SCOBIE: Coming over now.  
(A forklift truck approaches, carrying the Tardis lying on its side.)

**[Office]**

SHEARD: But why does it have to be another Concorde?  
DOCTOR: We must follow the same route, same height, same speed, and with my
equipment on board I can identify what I believe to be an exponential time
contour.  
SHEARD: And you really believe that Victor Foxtrot flew into a time warp?  
DOCTOR: Exactly. And we can't have a navigational hazard like that hanging
about the galaxy.  
(The telephone rings. Sheard answers it.)  
SHEARD: Yes? Thank you. Golf Alpha Charlie is ready for boarding.

**[GAC Flight deck]**

BILTON: Here they come.

**[Heathrow Airport]**

TEGAN: I saw Concorde once on the tarmac at Melbourne.  
(The Tardis is loaded, still on its side, because Concorde is/was a skinny
aircraft. The Tardis crew are greeted at the top of the steps.)  
STAPLEY: Morning, Doctor. I'm Captain Stapley.

**[GAC Flight deck]**

STAPLEY: May I introduce my First Officer, Andrew Bilton? Our Flight Engineer,
Roger Scobie.  
DOCTOR: And this is Nyssa and Tegan.  
STAPLEY: Would you mind going back and fastening your seatbelts for takeoff,
please.  
DOCTOR: Right.

**[Air Traffic Control]**

HORTON: Golf Alpha Charlie clear for takeoff.  
(The graceful delta sours into the sky. A little later, Horton's supervisor
comes over.)  
HORTON: Golf Alpha Charlie is now at fifty eight thousand feet, a hundred and
fifty miles off the Cornish coast. It's scheduled to turn onto its approach in
four minutes.

**[GAC Flight deck]**

STAPLEY: Do you seriously believe that Victor Foxtrot got caught in some sort
of time slip?  
DOCTOR: It would seem to be the logical explanation.  
STAPLEY: That's a pretty rum idea to me.  
SCOBIE: Hang on a moment though, Doctor. If we follow Victor Foxtrot's course
and end up somewhere over the rainbow, well, we're on a one-way ticket just
like Captain Urquhart's lot.  
DOCTOR: Ah, you're forgetting the Tardis.  
STAPLEY: The Tardis? You mean that police box?  
DOCTOR: That's right.  
(The Doctor leaves the cramped flight deck.)

**[Air Traffic Control]**

STAPLEY [OC]: Golf Alpha Charlie now at fifty north twenty west. Request
clearance to return to London.  
HORTON: Golf Alpha Charlie clear to turn to port. Route via us here on
November fifteen west to London.  
STAPLEY [OC]: Roger. Golf Alpha Charlie turning to port.  
HORTON: They're now on the same configuration as one nine two.

**[Concorde hold]**

DOCTOR: It's amazing.  
NYSSA: What?  
DOCTOR: This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside.  
(The Doctor unlocks the Tardis door, which is fortunately face up.)  
DOCTOR: Wait here.

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor slides down the floor and reaches for a switch on the console. The
interior moves ninety degrees and Nyssa walks in, followed by Tegan.)  
NYSSA: I wish I'd known about that when we were on Castrovalva.  
DOCTOR: So useful when you want to maintain a dignified attitude.  
TEGAN: Concorde should begin a descent deceleration procedure at any minute.

**[Air Traffic Control]**

STAPLEY [OC]: Golf Alpha Charlie request permission to descend to three seven
zero.  
HORTON: It's happening again.

**[GAC Flight deck]**

BILTON: Did you feel something?  
STAPLEY: I'm not sure. Golf Alpha Charlie, permission to descend to three
seven zero. London, this is Golf Alpha Charlie, do you read?

**[Tardis]**

NYSSA: Doctor, we're time travelling!  
TEGAN: The column isn't moving.  
DOCTOR: Concorde has just flown into the time contour.

**[GAC Flight deck]**

SCOBIE: Captain, the radiation meter's on alert.  
(The Doctor enters.)  
STAPLEY: Must be a solar flare.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I doubt it, Captain. It's simply reacting to centuries of galactic
radiation through which we're passing.  
STAPLEY: London, this is Golf Alpha Charlie. Do you read?  
DOCTOR: I'm afraid your radio is useless, Captain. By my estimation we're the
spatial equivalent of four hundred billion miles from Air Traffic Control.  
MAN [OC]: Golf Alpha Charlie clear to descend to three seven zero.  
STAPLEY: Fasten your seatbelt please, Doctor. By my calculations we're twenty
minutes from touchdown.

**[Air Traffic Control]**

HORTON: We've lost them.  
SHEARD: Another Concorde. So much for the Doctor.  
HORTON: But where have they gone?

**[Heathrow Airport]**

(GAC has landed.)  
STAPLEY: Heathrow, Doctor.  
TEGAN: Kinda feel at home, getting in and out of aircraft. It's all a bit
unreal after the Tardis.  
NYSSA: There's something very unreal about all of this.  
DOCTOR: That's why this tree doth continue to be since observed by yours
faithfully, God.  
STAPLEY: What's that, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: To be is to be perceived. A naive eighteenth century philosophy.  
STAPLEY: Ah.  
(Nyssa is the last one down the steps. She stops, looks around, and screams at
a group of four corpses nearby propped against a wall.)  
TEGAN: Nyssa, what's the matter?  
NYSSA: Didn't you see them? There were decaying corpses.  
BILTON: There's nothing there.  
DOCTOR: Nothing there. I wonder. Perceptual induction.  
BILTON: What are you talking about, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I want you all to concentrate very hard.  
SCOBIE: You don't give up, do you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Concentrate. Look at anything. Observe it in every detail.  
STAPLEY: What are you doing to us, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Perceptual induction. And I'm undoing it. Concentrate! It's the only
way to fight it and find out where we really are.  
STAPLEY: But we're at Heathrow.  
DOCTOR: No, you think you're at Heathrow. So did I. Well, almost, up to a
moment ago. Now concentrate, all together. It must be a concerted effort.  
TEGAN: That plane. I can't focus properly.  
NYSSA: Nothing's moving.  
BILTON: It is blurred.  
NYSSA: I'm getting cold.  
DOCTOR: You see? The coherence is breaking up.  
(There is a blinding flash.)

**[** **By Concorde]**

(The group are huddled by a small rocky outcrop in the middle of an open
landscape with little vegetation.)  
STAPLEY: Where are we?  
DOCTOR: Just where you thought we were, Captain.  
STAPLEY: Heathrow?  
DOCTOR: Some a hundred and forty million years ago.  
SCOBIE: I think I'm dreaming.  
DOCTOR: Quite the reverse, Mister Scobie. You've just woken up.  
BILTON: I don't believe it.  
DOCTOR: Definitely Jurassic. There's a nip in the air, though. We can't be far
off the Pleistocene era.  
TEGAN: The ice age?  
DOCTOR: It's times like this I wish I still had my scarf. Better watch out for
the odd brontosaurus.  
NYSSA: Were they the creatures I saw?  
DOCTOR: I doubt it, but I should think they came from this time zone.  
STAPLEY: Do you really mean we've gone backward down a time contour?  
DOCTOR: Have you another explanation?  
BILTON: But we were on Concorde.  
STAPLEY: How did we land on this?  
(One of Concorde's landing wheels is nearby.)  
DOCTOR: Very violently, by the look of it.  
BILTON: But the touchdown was perfect.  
DOCTOR: It's like having a tooth out under hypnosis. You don't feel a thing.  
STAPLEY: But the approach to Heathrow was utterly real.  
DOCTOR: So was the Indian rope trick.  
STAPLEY: And Doctor, somewhere in this wilderness must be the passengers and
crew of Victor Foxtrot.  
DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry, Captain, we'll find them. Let's hope no one finds us
first.  
BILTON: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: Behind every illusion there's a conjurer. In this case, I shouldn't
think he went to all this trouble for our entertainment.  
TEGAN: Doctor! It's the other Concorde!  
DOCTOR: Tegan, wait! All of you, stay here.

**[Chamber]**

(An ancient Oriental figure chants before a large white globe held above a
pedestal by three curved legs.)  
KALID: Sharaz, sharaz tumal. Balor, balor. Sharaz, sharaz tumal balor balor.  
(The Doctor and Tegan are visible in the globe.)  
KALID: All things come to their appointed end soon. Soon.

**[Wilderness]**

TEGAN: Look, a building. Are we hallucinating?  
DOCTOR: I doubt it. The illusion is always one of normality.  
TEGAN: Well, that's not exactly Terminal Three, but who could have built it?  
DOCTOR: I think the answer might be over there.

**[** **By Concorde]**

(The men are getting cold.)  
SCOBIE: How much longer have we got to wait here?  
BILTON: Why don't we do a bit of a recce?  
STAPLEY: I've developed a very healthy respect for the Doctor, and he wants us
to stay put.  
NYSSA: No! Danger. We must find the Doctor.  
BILTON: Nyssa, what's the matter?  
STAPLEY: Come on, we'd better go after her.

**[Chamber]**

(The passengers and crew of Victor Foxtrot are being given their
instructions.)  
KALID: You have your work, go to it.  
(The people leave as if in a trance.)  
KALID: Visan, visan.  
(The Tardis is shown on the globe.)

**[Wilderness]**

BILTON: Look! It's a motorway.  
SCOBIE: I bet it's the M4!  
NYSSA: It's an illusion.  
BILTON: I don't care. It might lead us out of this time warp.  
STAPLEY: No, don't.  
SCOBIE: At least it looks like civilisation.  
STAPLEY: Scobie, stay where you are, and that is an order. Remember the Indian
rope trick.  
NYSSA: I can't see anything.  
(The mirage fades away.)  
NYSSA: What was the Indian rope trick?

**[Spaceship wreckage]**

TEGAN: Someone's ship?  
DOCTOR: Been here a long time.  
TEGAN: Doctor, can we get out of here?

**[Wilderness]**

SCOBIE: So, this fakir throws the rope up in the air and he and his assistant
climb up it. Hey presto, disappeared.

**[** **By Concorde]**

TEGAN: They've gone.

**[Wilderness]**

SCOBIE: But some clever devil had taken photographs and the reality is that
there's the rope lying on the floor, and this Indian juju man and his oppo are
hiding behind some bushes laughing like a couple of skunks.  
STAPLEY: Quiet. Look.  
(A group are moving the Tardis across the ground.)  
NYSSA: They've got the Tardis!  
BILTON: There's Dave Culshaw and Angela Clifford. They were on Victor Foxtrot!  
(Bilton and Scobie rush forward.)  
STAPLEY: Wait!  
BILTON: Angela! Hey, hey, Angela!  
ANGELA: Andrew, what are you doing here? You didn't tell me you had a New York
stopover.  
BILTON: What are you talking about?  
SCOBIE: Look, old chap, this is all a bit of a snare and a delusion.  
ANGELA: Andrew, we've got a few chores to do. See you in the bar in half an
hour.  
BILTON: Look, snap out of it. You're not in New York.  
ANGELA: The Captain wants us to try that new Indonesian restaurant he's found.  
(Angela and Culshaw start to walk away.)  
SCOBIE: We'll have to grab them.  
STAPLEY: What's happening?  
(Bilton, Scobie, Angela and Culshaw freeze, then they are surrounded by man-
sized creatures of opaque bubbles that move. A sudden fog moves in then
vanishes and only Angela and Culshaw remain. They walk away.

**[Chamber]**

KALID: Showa shirah sharah sharum.

**[Wilderness]**

STAPLEY: Doctor, those creatures have taken Bilton and Scobie.

**[Chamber]**

KALID: Evenarab.  
(The globe shows the quartet.)  
KALID: Tumal, tumal.

**[Wilderness]**

DOCTOR: Are you sure it wasn't an illusion?  
STAPLEY: They were real, all right.  
NYSSA: Doctor!  
STAPLEY: Behind you!  
(Four bubble creatures surround the Doctor, then he is enveloped.)

__**Part Two**__

**[Wilderness]**

NYSSA: Stop! You mustn't fight it. The Doctor'll be all right.  
STAPLEY: But how could he possibly  
NYSSA: I just know!

**[In the bubbles]**

VOICE [OC]: Doctor, help. Help. (something) Help.

**[Wilderness]**

TEGAN: What's happening now?  
(The bubbles slowly disappear to reveal the Doctor lying on the ground. Tegan
and Stapley help him to his feet.)  
DOCTOR: Captain Stapley, are you all right?  
STAPLEY: Am I all right? Those were the creatures that got hold of Bilton and
Scobie.  
DOCTOR: What creatures?  
TEGAN: Those blobs.  
DOCTOR: Oh, you mean the Plasmatons.  
STAPLEY: Whatever you want to call them.  
DOCTOR: Protein agglomeration. Random particles assembled from the atmosphere.
Quite harmless, I assure you.  
STAPLEY: Doctor, there's no technique that can make matter like that out of
thin air.  
DOCTOR: Oh, isn't there? Now what about the energy that telepathically
generated the idea that we were at Heathrow? You think that can't operate on a
physical level?  
NYSSA: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: It's simply a form of psychokinesis.  
STAPLEY: You mean like that spoon-bending nonsense?  
TEGAN: So it seems.  
NYSSA: Doctor, those people were taking away the Tardis.  
DOCTOR: What?  
(In the cave, the cloud swirls in and deposits Bilton and Scobie in front of
Kalid.)  
DOCTOR: Didn't you even bother to look to see where they were taking it?  
HAYTER: Hey!  
(An older man with a white beard and glasses approaches. Everyone say Hi! to
Nigel Stock.)  
HAYTER: Are you from the other Concorde?  
STAPLEY: Yes. Captain Stapley, British Airways.  
HAYTER: Professor Hayter, University of Darlington.  
STAPLEY: You must be from flight one nine two. Where are all the other
passengers? What happened to you?  
HAYTER: You're not hallucinating.  
STAPLEY: Certainly not.  
HAYTER: You've no idea what it's been like, resisting alone. Who are these
people?  
STAPLEY: Oh, this is the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: And this is Nyssa and Tegan.  
HAYTER: You're all with Captain Stapley?  
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm sorry if we seem like an unlikely rescue party.  
HAYTER: Oh, yes.  
DOCTOR: Well, don't worry. You're not imagining us.  
STAPLEY: If it hadn't been for the Doctor, we would never have found you.  
HAYTER: At least you're here. How did the Russians let you land?  
STAPLEY: Russians?  
HAYTER: Aren't we behind the Iron Curtain? Siberia?  
STAPLEY: Well, er, not exactly.  
HAYTER: Then where are we?

**[Chamber]**

(The Tardis is placed upright by the cave wall.)  
KALID: You will return to your other work.  
BILTON: Tardis. Tardis. Tardis.  
KALID: To your work!  
BILTON: Rope. Rope! That's it! Rope trick!  
KALID: Ramshara norinvora.  
(Bilton is mesmerised again.)  
KALID: You will proceed with your work.  
BILTON: Concorde? Concorde. Speedbird Concorde one nine two clear for takeoff.

**[Wilderness]**

HAYTER: I must have passed out during the hijack. I think we all did. The next
thing I knew, we were in this mausoleum. They'd got everybody under some sort
of hypnosis. At Darlington that's my speciality, so I was able to counter
suggest. Not easy, I can tell you. Hyperstimulation of eidetic images. The
most powerful hallucinatory induction I've ever come across. They must be
using ultrasonics.  
DOCTOR: Who are they, Professor Hayter?  
HAYTER: I don't know. Even the guards are disguised.  
DOCTOR: Guards? Oh, you mean the Plasmatons.  
HAYTER: The what?  
DOCTOR: Oh, it doesn't matter. At least you managed to get away without
alerting these guards. Look, I want you to show us the way to this mausoleum.  
HAYTER: You're not serious!  
STAPLEY: Hayter, I've got to find my crew.  
DOCTOR: And I've got to find my Tardis.  
HAYTER: Tardis?  
TEGAN: Without it, we'll never get back to the twentieth century.  
HAYTER: What did you say?  
NYSSA: She's absolutely right. We've all travelled a hundred and forty million
years down a time contour.  
HAYTER: They're both hallucinating.  
TEGAN: It's true. Your aircraft got caught in a time warp.  
HAYTER: Unless we get them away  
STAPLEY: There's no time to explain, Hayter. I need you to show me where I can
find my crew. The Doctor has to get back his equipment.  
HAYTER: If you insist, Captain. The prison centre's somewhere on the other
side of that hill. What is this equipment of the Doctor's?  
STAPLEY: Well, it's a. You wouldn't believe me.

**[Chamber]**

(Kalid walks round the Tardis in delight, and kisses one of its ancient panels
before trying the door. His own equipment beeps and he goes over to the globe
to see Hayter leading Stapley, Tegan, Nyssa and the Doctor across the
wilderness.)  
KALID: Veram veram. Zarak naman.

**[Wilderness]**

(They round a rocky outcrop to see the building in the distance.)  
HAYTER: There it is.  
STAPLEY: How did that get built in this wilderness?  
HAYTER: Slave labour, I expect.  
DOCTOR: Come on, then.  
(Nyssa gets a bad attack of asthma.)  
NYSSA: Doctor! No! Something's happening. I, I, I can't. I can't.  
STAPLEY: What's happening to her?  
HAYTER: It's the radiation. I said we should keep away from this place.  
DOCTOR: Keep still.  
STAPLEY: We must help her.  
(Nyssa speaks with a deeper, slightly echoing voice.)  
NYSSA: Do not approach the citadel. Return to your ship. There is great
danger.  
DOCTOR: Who are you?  
STAPLEY: What's happening to her?  
DOCTOR: The intelligence. It's using Nyssa as a medium.  
HAYTER: More like hysteria triggered by ultrasonics.  
DOCTOR: Be quiet. Who are you? What do you want?  
NYSSA: We are. We are. The control divides us. But the control shall be
resisted. Resisted.

**[Chamber]**

KALID: You she thinks too clearly, my child.

**[Wilderness]**

NYSSA: There's so little time. You must resist. Resist.  
TEGAN: Look, it's happening again.  
(Bubbles appear and cover Nyssa.)  
NYSSA: Resist. Resist.  
TEGAN: It's the same stuff as the Plasmatons are made out of.  
DOCTOR: Someone wanted to stop her talking.  
STAPLEY: We've got to get her out of there.  
DOCTOR: I'm afraid we don't have the right kind of energy.  
STAPLEY: We can't just leave her!  
DOCTOR: Well, if we could find the source of the power, we might be able to
free her.  
STAPLEY: You go on, Doctor. I'll stay with Nyssa.  
TEGAN: No, you're more use to the Doctor. I'll stay with her.  
HAYTER: Going on is madness.  
TEGAN: Look, if we don't get the Tardis back we could be stuck here for ever.  
DOCTOR: Tegan's right. Look, she'll be perfectly all right. As soon as she's
free, you both go back to the Concorde.  
TEGAN: You bet. Good luck.  
DOCTOR: And don't try and follow us. Captain, Professor.  
HAYTER: Don't you realise we've got to get away from here? The effect will
only get worse the nearer we get to the centre of the radiation.  
DOCTOR: Is that a reason for abandoning your fellow passengers?  
STAPLEY: Look, if the intelligence is trying to contact us, who is trying to
stop it?  
DOCTOR: Something with the same resource of psychokinetic energy.  
STAPLEY: Another intelligence?  
DOCTOR: It could well be.  
TEGAN: Nyssa? Can you hear me? Nyssa!

**[Chamber]**

KALID: Shanwa sharah shamoh sharam.

**[Citadel]**

(The men enter a very dark passageway. Stapley has to duck below a rock beam.)  
STAPLEY: The place is deserted.  
HAYTER: Don't you believe it. Those guards appear from nowhere.  
DOCTOR: Those guards, as you call them, are fully occupied with Nyssa.  
HAYTER: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: The creatures you saw are particles of protoplasm bonded by psychic
energy. The essential protoplasm can take any shape.  
STAPLEY: Such as the shield around Nyssa?  
DOCTOR: Yes, but I suspect the power and raw material is limited, so as long
as Nyssa is trapped  
STAPLEY: No Plasmatons.  
HAYTER: I've never heard such an extravagant explanation.  
STAPLEY: How else do you explain what happened to Nyssa?  
HAYTER: Well, some form of projection. Maybe part hallucination.
Scientifically speaking, even  
DOCTOR: Scientifically speaking, I think we should find the others.

**[Wilderness]**

TEGAN: Nyssa? Nyssa! Can you hear me?

**[Sanctum chamber]**

The passageway passes entrances to a large well-light area. Some people are
trying to prise open a large stone object.)  
STAPLEY: There's Bilton and Scobie!  
DOCTOR: I wonder if they know where the Tardis is?  
HAYTER: I doubt if they can even remember their names. They're in a state of
trance.  
DOCTOR: It can't be far away.  
(The Doctor carries on down the passageway.)  
STAPLEY: If we could separate them.  
HAYTER: Look out for the guards!  
STAPLEY: The Doctor's theory's. Where is the Doctor?  
HAYTER: Forget him. Let's get out of here.  
STAPLEY: No!  
HAYTER: I don't know what this Doctor's qualifications are, but if you ask me,
the man's a lunatic.  
STAPLEY: I don't believe I did.  
(The Doctor comes to a junction. He tosses a coin to decide which way to go,
doesn't like the result and turns the coin over. He arrives at what appears to
be a dead end. Then the wall opens and he enters...)

**[Chamber]**

(And walks over to the Tardis.)  
KALID: So, you are here at last, Doctor.

**[Sanctum chamber]**

STAPLEY: What's behind that thing?  
HAYTER: Another thing, I shouldn't wonder. It's called hard labour.  
(We pull back to see that the people are trying to prise open sloping roof.)  
STAPLEY: The Doctor's theory is that this is a hijack in time rather than
space. This isn't the Soviet Union, Professor.  
HAYTER: This Doctor needs his head examined.

**[Chamber]**

DOCTOR: So you're the conjurer.  
KALID: I am Kalid.  
DOCTOR: You say that as if you expect a round of applause.  
KALID: Have a care, Doctor. You were not summoned to my domain to play the
clown.  
DOCTOR: Your domain?  
KALID: Here, Kalid rules.  
DOCTOR: Well, I apologise for my levity, not to mention my curiosity.  
KALID: What troubles your mind, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: What you're doing in this time zone, for a start.  
KALID: Shall Kalid not travel where the spirit leads him?  
DOCTOR: Would the spirit have anything to do with the ruins of that spaceship
out there?  
KALID: Spaceship?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
KALID: Space is within us, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Ah. Then exactly how do you travel?  
KALID: By the power of the Great One. In the deserts of Arabia I learnt all
the magic arts.  
DOCTOR: Magic? Arabia? Oh, come on, you can do better than that.  
KALID: You mock me, Doctor, but do not doubt that I can summon furies and
cacodaemons, a company of cherubim or Lucifer himself.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes, you're surrounded by a lot of powerful bioenergetics,
Kalid, but I can't help feeling there's something a great deal more
mechanistic about all this.  
KALID: Mechanistic?  
DOCTOR: What are you doing, sitting at the end of a time contour like a spider
in a web? And what do you want with my Tardis?  
KALID: My familiar spirits have told me of your miraculous cabinet. The
spirits have told me you would come.  
DOCTOR: Your spirits are very well-informed.  
KALID: I hold the whole genius of night bound to my will. And now the great
elemental has summoned you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Not just me, Kalid. What do you want with all these passengers?  
KALID: Slaves are required in my domain.  
DOCTOR: You have the Plasmatons.  
KALID: They have other uses.  
DOCTOR: You mean you need the psychotronic energy for something else.

**[In the bubbles]**

VOICE [OC]: Resistance. Kalid shall be resisted.  
NYSSA: Who are you?

**[Chamber]**

KALID: The power shall be used for the great work we shall do together.  
DOCTOR: We?  
KALID: Together we shall scourge the entirety of space and time.  
DOCTOR: You can exclude me from your wizardry.  
KALID: You cannot resist, Doctor. In this place, all things obey Kalid. Come.
Look.  
(Kalid leads the Doctor to the globe, to see where Tegan and Nyssa wait.)  
KALID: Visan, visan, zanor minaz. You see your friend? Visan, visan.  
(The image changes to Stapley and Hayter.)  
KALID: Your Captain Stapley and his fellow mortals.  
DOCTOR: Very impressive, Kalid, but your incantation is just triggering
someone else's energy. You're not in control here. You're just as mortal as
anyone else.

**[Sanctum chamber]**

STAPLEY: I wish the Doctor wouldn't wander off.  
HAYTER: I thought you were in charge, Captain Stapley.  
STAPLEY: I am, but I happen to respect his judgement.  
HAYTER: You also came here to rescue your crew, or do you need to ask the
Doctor's permission first?  
STAPLEY: Don't provoke me, Professor.  
HAYTER: Your crew is in front of you. Haven't we wasted enough time?  
STAPLEY: All right. Bilton?  
BILTON: Hello, Captain. I've got the met report. We'll clear those
thunderstorms by the  
STAPLEY: Wake up, Bilton!  
(Hayter tackles Angela.)  
HAYTER: You must listen carefully to what I say.  
ANGELA: Will you please sit down, sir, and fasten your seatbelt. We're about
to take off.  
HAYTER: Listen to me!  
ANGELA: The bar will be open as soon as we're airborne.  
STAPLEY: We're not at Heathrow.  
BILTON: Oxygen check, flight-control inverters on, anti-stall systems on  
STAPLEY: Stop it, Andrew. No.  
BILTON: Altimeters checked. Navigation radios set.  
STAPLEY: Professor!  
BILTON: Brakes.  
STAPLEY: Check.  
BILTON: Throttles.  
STAPLEY: Idle.  
BILTON: Throttle masters.  
STAPLEY: Professor! Speedbird Concorde one nine two to tower. Request
permission to start engines.  
(Hayter shakes Stapley.)  
HAYTER: Wake up, man!  
STAPLEY: What?  
HAYTER: Concentrate! What about the Doctor, Captain Stapley?  
STAPLEY: Doctor? The Doctor! And my crew! Bilton. Bilton! Remember what
happened at Heathrow?  
BILTON: What's that, Captain?  
STAPLEY: Remember the Doctor! Remember Nyssa and Tegan. Remember Tegan?  
BILTON: Tegan. Yes!

**[Chamber]**

KALID: Together with your box, the power will be absolute. We shall command
the whole universe.  
DOCTOR: I've always found domination such an unattractive prospect.  
KALID: Shall I be forced to compel you, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: There is no power that will give you control of the Tardis.  
(The globe beeps. Kalid rushes over to see Stapley waking up Scobie.)  
KALID: Shara, shara, kazan.  
(In the wilderness, the bubbles leave Nyssa and she keels over, eyes staring.)

**[Sanctum chamber]**

BILTON: Come on, Roger. Wake up, now. Come on!  
STAPLEY: Look out!  
(Solid plasmatons appear.)

**[Wilderness]**

TEGAN: Nyssa, are you all right?  
NYSSA: Of course.  
TEGAN: What happened?  
NYSSA: The power dissolved. It was needed elsewhere.  
TEGAN: What are you talking about?  
NYSSA: I don't know. I keep getting this intuition.

**[Chamber]**

KALID: Shara, shara tumal. Nazeem, nazeem.

**[Sanctum chamber]**

STAPLEY: Come on, Roger. You're coming with us.  
(But more plasmatons block their way.)

**[Chamber]**

KALID: Iznavin, iznavin.

**[Wilderness]**

TEGAN: I promised the Doctor we'd go back to Concorde.  
NYSSA: No.  
TEGAN: But Nyssa  
NYSSA: We must go to the citadel.  
TEGAN: We'll only get caught.  
NYSSA: The Doctor's in danger. Kalid!

**[Chamber]**

(The swirling cloud deposits Stapley, Scobie, Bilton and Hayter.)  
STAPLEY: Doctor!  
HAYTER: Who is this man?  
DOCTOR: Kalid.  
STAPLEY: Are you responsible for the abduction of my passengers and crew?  
HAYTER: Is it you who authorised mass hallucination?  
KALID: Your questions are irrelevant.  
STAPLEY: I don't think so!  
DOCTOR: No!  
(The air around the men becomes opaque.)  
STAPLEY: What's happening?  
DOCTOR: He's thrown up a barrier. I did try and warn you.

**[Citadel]**

(Nyssa leads Tegan down a dark passage.)  
TEGAN: Where are we going?  
NYSSA: To help the Doctor.  
TEGAN: Is this your intuition again?  
NYSSA: Yes. Can't you feel it too?  
TEGAN: No.  
NYSSA: We must find the centre. Trust me.  
TEGAN: Why not? It's a dead end.  
(The rock wall opens.)  
NYSSA: We must continue.

**[Chamber]**

KALID: The freedom of yourselves and your fellow passengers is in the hands of
the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: You're wasting your time, Kalid.  
KALID: I require the key of the Tardis.  
DOCTOR: I've already told you  
(The globe beeps. It shows Nyssa and Tegan on their way.)  
KALID: Aragoborago abolitha.

**[Citadel]**

(Tegan and Nyssa walk round a corner to see -)  
TEGAN: Adric!  
NYSSA: No. Adric's dead.  
TEGAN: How can we be sure?  
ADRIC: Go back, Tegan, or you will destroy me.  
NYSSA: It's only imagination. It's the only power Kalid has left to stop us.  
ADRIC: If you advance, you will kill me, Nyssa.  
TEGAN: We can't take that risk.  
NYSSA: The badge.  
TEGAN: What?  
NYSSA: Adric's wearing his badge.  
TEGAN: But it was shattered when the Doctor destroyed the Cyberleader.  
NYSSA: Exactly.  
TEGAN: Come on.  
(Adric starts screaming and they walk through him. He vanishes.)

**[Chamber]**

KALID: I must prevent all mortal advance.  
DOCTOR: Out of bounds, are they, Kalid?  
KALID: Not even I have dared penetrate the heart of the citadel.  
DOCTOR: You mean you've not been able to.  
KALID: You will watch them suffer for this. Sharam sharah, sharah sharom.

**[Citadel]**

(Melkur appears to block their way.)  
TEGAN: What is it?  
NYSSA: Melkur. What comes from it killed my father.  
(Melkur steps forward.)  
NYSSA: I don't believe in you.  
TEGAN: Come on.  
(They walk through Melkur.)

**[Chamber]**

DOCTOR: Well, Kalid, it seems a power greater than yours is protecting them.  
KALID: Vraa nagim!

**[Citadel]**

(The Terileptil leader growls at them.)  
TEGAN: You're not real.  
(They carry on through the image. Another hidden door rolls open.)

**[Chamber]**

(Kalid starts to panic.)  
KALID: They have entered the sanctum.  
DOCTOR: It's your powerhouse, is it?  
KALID: Doctor, you will give me the key of the Tardis.  
DOCTOR: No.  
KALID: Then you will see your friends here destroyed and you yourself
annihilated.  
DOCTOR: I don't think so. We've all got quite good at resisting your sorcery.  
KALID: Sator sobal sotos mondoro.  
(The forcefield round the men vanishes.)  
KALID: Sator monbravo.  
(The cloud appears.)  
BILTON: Not again!  
KALID: You will not resist my combatant.  
STAPLEY: These things have proven themselves harmless.  
DOCTOR: I'm not so sure about this one.  
(Stapley takes an energy rod from around Kalid's dais.)  
STAPLEY: Bah, it's just a ball of cotton wool.  
(He swings at the cloud and there is a loud crack!)  
DOCTOR: Kalid is drawing on deeper reserves of power, and that thing is
bonding itself into something far more dangerous than a Plasmaton.  
(It looks like a giant red double-headed snake.)  
KALID: Well, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: The answer is still no, Kalid.  
KALID: The Tardis key, Doctor!  
BILTON: Please, Doctor!  
KALID: Do you really want to see your friends die?

**[Sanctum]**

NYSSA: The Doctor! Help me.  
(She goes to a bunch of crystals by the wall and starts to pull at one.)  
TEGAN: Why?  
NYSSA: Just help me.  
TEGAN: It won't budge.  
NYSSA: We must.  
(They free the crystal.)  
TEGAN: What are you doing?  
(Nyssa throws the crystal into a bowl in the middle of the sanctum. There's a
big bang.)

**[Chamber]**

(The snake thing screams and vanishes in a howling wind. Kalid is thrown back
and falls to the floor.)  
KALID: Argh! No more!  
(The wind goes away.)  
DOCTOR: The power's gone.  
STAPLEY: Look at Kalid.  
(Yellow gunk is streaming from Kalid's nose.)  
HAYTER: There's got to be a perfectly simple orthodox explanation.
Bioenergetic powers? Intellectual garbage.  
(Hayter examines the globe pedestal.)  
DOCTOR: You won't find what you're looking for.  
HAYTER: Won't I? You come and look at this. Psychotronics, was it, Doctor? I
call it electronics.  
(The pedestal contains a circuit board and a lot of wires and pieces.)  
DOCTOR: I don't understand.  
(A familiar voice comes from behind them.)  
MASTER [OC]: No, Doctor, you never do understand.  
(Kalid stands up and removes his mask.)  
MASTER: You never do.

__**Part Three**__

**[Chamber]**

DOCTOR: So you escaped from Castrovalva. I should have guessed.  
MASTER: As gullible as ever, my dear Doctor.  
HAYTER: Magic, as in lantern. A son et lumiere performance. Sophisticated and
terrifying, I do not dispute.  
(The Master has removed all his disguise and is holding his deadly tissue
compressor.)  
MASTER: How you love the company of fools.  
SCOBIE: Hold on a moment. This crystal, there's no connection, no radio link.  
DOCTOR: The crystal is simply a point of focus. The communication is purely
telepathic.  
HAYTER: And what's all this equipment for?  
DOCTOR: What indeed.  
(The Doctor takes a look.)  
DOCTOR: These components are from your Tardis. You're stranded here! The time
contour you generated was a desperate lifeline to the future. It accidentally
converged with Concorde.  
MASTER: You are right, Doctor. I need your Tardis to penetrate the sanctum.  
DOCTOR: For a new source of power? I think you're too late. It seems to have
expended itself.  
MASTER: The recuperation will be swift. Your companions have entered the
sanctum, they've disturbed the neuronic nucleus, but they will have paid for
the incursion with their lives.  
BILTON: Nyssa and Tegan dead?  
DOCTOR: Oh, they're as likely to have been protected as destroyed. The power
works against as well as for you.  
MASTER: I shall soon have total control of the force. The Tardis key, Doctor.  
(The Master threatens the Doctor with the tissue compressor. Stapley and
Bilton rush forward and the Master turns his weapon on them.)  
DOCTOR: No heroics, please, gentlemen. The Master will eliminate you without a
second thought.  
(The Doctor holds out the Tardis key.)  
MASTER: Very wise, Doctor.  
HAYTER: Good heavens, that's never the Tardis?  
MASTER: Unfortunately it is. So typical of the Doctor's predilection for the
third-rate, but it will serve my purpose.  
(The Master enters the Tardis.)  
HAYTER: What does the man want with an obsolete Metropolitan  
(The Tardis dematerialises.)  
SCOBIE: Oh, no.  
HAYTER: We're hallucinating again.  
STAPLEY: Is that how you travel, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Not exactly the first class end of the market, but a serviceable
vehicle, Captain.  
HAYTER: Some kind of miasma.  
DOCTOR: I do not wish to believe, therefore I hallucinate. Is that the
philosophy of Darlington men, Professor?  
HAYTER: What I've just seen isn't possible.  
DOCTOR: Try telling that to Tegan and Nyssa when the Master materialises in
the sanctum.  
STAPLEY: Have you any idea where the sanctum is?  
BILTON: What about behind that wall, where the passengers were working?  
STAPLEY: Could be.  
SCOBIE: But if it is, how did the girls get in there?  
DOCTOR: The power source is unstable. Sometimes it works for the Master,
sometimes against.  
STAPLEY: But why?  
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I intend to find out.  
STAPLEY: Right, let's go.  
DOCTOR: No, no. Just the Professor and myself.  
SCOBIE: You'll need all the help you can get.  
DOCTOR: You've seen the hallucinogenic effects the power source can have. The
closer you get, the stronger it is. You wouldn't be able to resist.  
BILTON: The Professor's the same as us.  
DOCTOR: The Professor has shown stronger resistance than most. By the way, if
the Master turns up again, don't be surprised. It may take him a little time
to discover I left the er, coordinate override switched in. Ready?

**[Citadel]**

(Tegan and Nyssa are lying on the sanctum floor as the Doctor leads Hayter
along a stone passageway.)  
DOCTOR: The Master was so desperate to penetrate the sanctum he resorted to
brute force.  
HAYTER: My fellow passengers?  
DOCTOR: Exactly.  
HAYTER: I'll say one thing, Doctor. For some of them it'll be the first day's
honest work they've done in their lives.  
DOCTOR: Let's hope they still have enough strength left to break down the wall
for us.

**[Sanctum chamber]**

HAYTER: How long before the power returns?  
DOCTOR: I don't know.  
HAYTER: Doctor, they've stopped hallucinating.  
DOCTOR: That's not necessarily a good thing.  
HAYTER: How do you mean?  
DOCTOR: Are you any good at explanations?  
HAYTER: Oh, yes, I take your point.  
ANGELA: It is Professor Hayter?  
HAYTER: That's correct.  
ANGELA: Thank goodness for a friendly face. I'm Angela Clifford.  
HAYTER: This is the Doctor. He's here to help us.  
DOCTOR: Are your passengers unharmed?  
ANGELA: Those I've seen are. Do you know where we are?  
(The Doctor gestures to Hayter to give an explanation while he looks at the
mausoleum they've been trying to open.)  
HAYTER: Not exactly.  
ANGELA: Do you know what's happened to Captain Urquhart and the rest of the
crew?  
HAYTER: My dear young lady, it's no good asking me. The Doctor's the expert
here.  
(Hayter gets given a Look.)

**[Chamber]**

SCOBIE: In all my years in a flight engineer I have never seen anything like  
BILTON: Listen!  
(The Tardis materialises, as forecast. The men hide. The Master comes out and
goes to the globe pedestal.)  
STAPLEY: (sotto) I've got an idea. Roger, you wait here for the Doctor.
Andrew, come with me.  
(Stapley and Bilton tiptoe behind the Master's back and into the Tardis.)

**[Tardis]**

BILTON: It's not possible!  
STAPLEY: Quickly, Andrew.  
BILTON: You're never going to try and take off?  
STAPLEY: Of course not, but somewhere here there must be a control for these
doors.  
(Stapley reaches for the big red lever that controls the doors.)  
BILTON: Oh, I wouldn't have thought it was that.  
STAPLEY: No.  
BILTON: So we lock the Master out of the Tardis?  
STAPLEY: Well, maybe not out of the Tardis, but we should be able to keep him
off this flight deck. Always assuming this is the flight deck. Well, here
goes.  
(Beep.)  
BILTON: I hope you know what you're doing.  
STAPLEY: I haven't the foggiest.  
(He turns on the scanner.)  
STAPLEY: Ah, that's more like it. Now, if we can hold up the Master long
enough for the Doctor to get through to Nyssa and Tegan  
BILTON: Captain!  
(The Master is returning to the Tardis with a couple of components. Stapley
and Bilton hide behind the interior door. The Master ducks underneath the
console to fit his items.)

**[Outside the console room]**

BILTON: He's going to try and take off again. We've got to get out of here.  
STAPLEY: We're staying where we are. The Tardis is our only link with the
twentieth century. Where it goes, we go.

**[Sanctum chamber]**

ANGELA: Now, you heard what the Doctor said. We've got to get through this
wall. Now you people stay here and the rest of you come with me.  
(Angela leads a group back to work on the mausoleum.)  
ANGELA: Do you really think the rest of the crew are all right?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sure of it. Either they've been press-ganged into other work
or they're locked up safely out of harm's way.  
(The Doctor moves away.)  
ANGELA: It's incredible. We were doing this without realising it.  
HAYTER: Certainly.  
ANGELA: What sort of power could do that to us?  
HAYTER: We won't know that until we get to the other side of that wall.  
ANGELA: Won't that be dangerous? What if the force returns?  
HAYTER: Fight it. It's perfectly possible.  
ANGELA: How?  
HAYTER: Focus your mind on something you're very sure of. Your family, fish
and chips. Concentrate on that one thought to keep the dream images out. All
right? Now come on, everybody, we haven't got much time.  
(The group are prising panels off the mausoleum.)  
HAYTER: We're nearly there, Doctor! Doctor?  
DOCTOR: The Master's Tardis.  
HAYTER: That pillar?  
DOCTOR: Of course. That's where he's hidden the other passengers.  
HAYTER: But it's not big enough.  
DOCTOR: Something else for me to explain later.  
HAYTER: This revolutionises the whole concept of relative dimension. Oh
Doctor, if only I were a younger man and had the time to make use of your
knowledge.  
DOCTOR: The time. Yes, that's another thing.  
HAYTER: Huh?  
(In the Tardis, the Master finishes fitting his items then closes the doors.)  
DOCTOR: What's this?  
(Cables running across the floor from the Master's Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: I want to see where this goes.  
HAYTER: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: An induction loop! So that's how he generated the time contour. Don't
you see what this means?  
HAYTER: I certainly do not.  
DOCTOR: He's already harnessing the power in the loop, in the chamber, in the
sanctum!  
HAYTER: But Doctor, aren't we going into this Tardis thing?  
DOCTOR: The wall is much more important. Tegan and Nyssa are behind it.

**[Outside the console room]**

(The Tardis still will not work for the Master.)  
STAPLEY: Engine trouble.  
BILTON: That's a bit of luck.  
STAPLEY: I'm not so sure. If there's a fault in the Tardis, we could be
marooned in this wilderness forever.

**[Sanctum chamber]**

ANGELA: Be careful, now.  
(There is a hole in the mausoleum roof.)  
DOCTOR: Now, you don't have to come in if you don't want to.  
HAYTER: I'll learn nothing waiting for you here.  
DOCTOR: Good man. The rest of you stay here.

**[Sanctum]**

(The Doctor climbs through the hole and goes to Nyssa and Tegan. They start to
wake.)  
HAYTER: How are they?  
DOCTOR: They're just stunned.  
TEGAN: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Are you all right?  
TEGAN: I think so. There was an explosion. Oh, my head aches.  
DOCTOR: You rest a while.  
NYSSA: They willed us to come here.  
HAYTER: Who are they?  
DOCTOR: Look in the sarcophagus, Professor.  
(The sarcophagus being the thing in the middle of the room.)  
HAYTER: It's alive!

**[Tardis]**

(Scobie watches the Tardis flickering and groaning. Frustrated, the Master
opens the doors and leaves. Stapley and Bilton come out of hiding.)  
STAPLEY: Keep your eye on the screen, Andrew.  
(Stapley goes underneath the console and removes circuit boards.)  
BILTON: What are you doing?  
STAPLEY: A trouble shared is a trouble doubled. I only hope the Doctor knows
how to put all this back.  
BILTON: Sabotage!

**[Sanctum]**

HAYTER: What is it?  
(It's orange and bubbly.)  
DOCTOR: An immeasurable intelligence at the centre of a psychic vortex, all
seeing, all knowing.  
HAYTER: I've certainly never seen a living organism like this before.  
NYSSA: Why did it want me to destroy it?  
DOCTOR: It didn't. That's why it deflected your attack.  
TEGAN: That explosion?  
DOCTOR: A massive burst of psychokinetic energy.  
HAYTER: That must be when the creature evaporated.  
DOCTOR: The power diverted to defend itself.  
HAYTER: But why work against itself?  
NYSSA: Two aspects of the same personality, the good and the bad.  
DOCTOR: Jekyll and Hyde.  
TEGAN: But why should half the creature want to attack us anyway?  
DOCTOR: Oh, not the creature itself. The power was being used by the Master.  
NYSSA: The Master's here?  
TEGAN: Well, at least we've got half the force on our side.  
NYSSA: Perhaps more. The power that led us here was very strong.  
HAYTER: How did you get in?  
TEGAN: Well, the wall just opened.  
DOCTOR: Part of the benign intelligence must have triggered a hidden
mechanism.  
TEGAN: Is that what happened to you?  
DOCTOR: We had to force our way in.  
TEGAN: Where?  
(The hole in the sloping roof has been sealed.)  
HAYTER: The blocks have been put back. We're trapped!

**[Tardis]**

STAPLEY: Well, that should put paid to any plans the Master has to take off in
this.  
BILTON: I thought after Concorde you could fly anything, but I can't make head
nor tail of this.  
MASTER: I'm sorry the Doctor's not here to explain the controls.  
STAPLEY: Well, you seem to be having a little difficulty with Tardis yourself.  
MASTER: It's no longer important to me.  
(He takes a look at Stapley's sabotage and removes some more circuits.)  
MASTER: I now have all that I require. The Tardis, for what it's worth, is
yours.  
(He presses a button.)  
MASTER: Bon voyage, gentlemen.  
(The Master operates the door control and dashes out. The Tardis
dematerialises.)

**[Sanctum]**

TEGAN: I don't understand it. The entire wall's solid.  
DOCTOR: The power must be returning.  
TEGAN: But if you physically broke through?  
DOCTOR: Well, someone filled in the hole.  
TEGAN: The passengers? Why?  
DOCTOR: Whatever part of the intelligence that is now controlling them wants
us walled up in here.  
TEGAN: We are trapped?  
DOCTOR: Till the Master turns up with the Tardis.  
HAYTER: Doctor, come and look at this.  
(Hayter has found a blue statuette.)  
HAYTER: It's some sort of figurine. There's another one, and another. Could
they be some sort of votive offering? In which case, this chamber might have
some religious significance.  
DOCTOR: The Xeraphin.  
HAYTER: You've seen one of these before?  
DOCTOR: A legendary race, long since extinct.  
NYSSA: The Xeraphin?  
DOCTOR: They're supposed to have lived on the planet Xeraphas, before it was
devastated by crossfire in the Vardon-Kosnax war.  
HAYTER: Oh Doctor, please, on top of everything else, not little green men
from outer space.  
DOCTOR: Oh, there's nothing green about the Xeraphin, I assure you. Highly
developed creatures. Beings with immense mental power.  
TEGAN: Doesn't it remind you of something?  
NYSSA: The work of a tissue compression eliminator.  
HAYTER: What are you talking about?  
TEGAN: Well, it's a little toy of the Master's.  
DOCTOR: It's the weapon I warned you against. If the Master used it on you,
you'd end up just like this. They must have come out of the casket.  
HAYTER: But the thing in there is alive, and there's only one organism.  
DOCTOR: _Don't you see? Cellular fusion. Reduction to a hypostatic amalgam._
No wonder the animus is so strong. Apart from the Master's victims, the entire
race of the Xeraphin is in this sarcophagus.

**[Tardis]**

BILTON: So much for sabotage.  
STAPLEY: I thought I'd tampered with enough bits and pieces to ground
anything.  
BILTON: Captain!  
(The scanner shows they are in midair.)  
STAPLEY: That's the citadel.  
BILTON: If that's the case, the Tardis has turned into a helicopter.

**[Chamber]**

SCOBIE: Doctor?  
(He goes out into a passageway. The Master returns to his Tardis.)

**[Sanctum]**

DOCTOR: The whole race physically amalgamated into one organism with one
immense personality. That's why the Master came here. That's why he laid this
loop around the chamber. He wants this at the centre of his Tardis.  
NYSSA: Why?  
DOCTOR: He must have exhausted his own dynomorphic generator.  
NYSSA: Of course. The nucleus is the perfect substitute.  
DOCTOR: And infinitely more powerful.  
NYSSA: The power's returning. Can't you feel it?  
DOCTOR: We must find a way out of here.  
(Nyssa steps up to the sarcophagus.)  
NYSSA: Don't be afraid, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: No, Nyssa, you'll be absorbed.  
NYSSA: The Xeraphin is calling us. The Xeraphin is very close.  
DOCTOR: No, stop! Nyssa, talk to me. Explain it to me.  
NYSSA: The Xeraphin contains the wisdom of the universe. Without the
knowledge, you cannot escape from the sanctum.  
DOCTOR: But the knowledge will consume you!  
NYSSA: The sacrifice is required for your survival, Doctor, and the future of
the Xeraphin.  
HAYTER: Stop! I shall talk to the Xeraphin.  
DOCTOR: No, Professor.  
HAYTER: I'm a scientist, Doctor. The chance of inheriting the wisdom of all
the universe is an opportunity I cannot ignore.  
DOCTOR: It will destroy you. You don't understand what you're doing.  
HAYTER: Precisely, Doctor. But soon I shall know everything.  
NYSSA: The Xeraphin welcomes you, Professor.  
(Tegan drags Nyssa away from the sarcophagus and Hayter steps up.)  
DOCTOR: Professor Hayter, get back from there!  
(A bright yellow glow envelopes Hayter. He screams and falls to the ground,
curled up tight. The glow fades.)

**[Citadel]**

ANGELA: Roger!  
SCOBIE: Angela! Are you all right?  
ANGELA: I can't resist for much longer.  
SCOBIE: What are you talking about?  
ANGELA: The dream world. Professor Hayter explained.  
SCOBIE: Are you still hallucinating?  
ANGELA: I'm trying to fight it. I feel so tired. Help me, Roger. I can't
always control the illusions.  
SCOBIE: Angela, don't give up now. You mustn't let go of your mind.  
ANGELA: The Professor said to think of something real.  
SCOBIE: Think of it, then. Just don't let them take you over.  
ANGELA: I don't see how you can resist so easily.  
SCOBIE: The Doctor destroyed the illusion as soon as we landed.  
ANGELA: The Doctor.  
SCOBIE: Was the Doctor with you?  
ANGELA: Yes. The Doctor  
SCOBIE: Did he break through into the sanctum?  
ANGELA: Yes. We broke through the wall.  
SCOBIE: Come on.

**[Tardis]**

BILTON: We must be in a perpetual holding pattern.  
STAPLEY: I'm going to have a go at flying this thing.  
BILTON: Are you sure?  
STAPLEY: What other chance have we got? Right.  
(Stapley pushes up what look like throttle controls, and the Tardis lurches.)

**[Sanctum chamber]**

ANGELA: Roger.  
SCOBIE: Where did you break through?  
ANGELA: Somewhere along here.  
SCOBIE: Well, this can't be it.  
ANGELA: The power returned. They sealed up the wall again.  
SCOBIE: You mean the Doctor's behind this lot?  
ANGELA: I tried to stop them.  
SCOBIE: We've got to get him out of here. He's our only link with the real
world. Come on.  
ANGELA: Roger.

**[Sanctum]**

DOCTOR: The molecular structure has completely broken up.  
(Even Hayter's tweed jacket disappears.)  
NYSSA: He's become a Plasmaton.  
DOCTOR: I think the Xeraphin is trying to materialise.  
(A silver humanoid appears in a column of light from the sarcophagus.)  
ANITHON: I am Anithon, of the race of the Xeraphin.

**[Sanctum chamber]**

(Angela walks away, in her own imaginary world.)  
SCOBIE: It's no good, we'll have to find some tools. Angela.  
(Scobie hides as the Master comes out of the pillar.)  
MASTER: Go into my Tardis. I am the Master. You will obey me.  
(Angela goes into the pillar, and the Master follows her.)

**[Sanctum]**

ANITHON: I come in this shape as ambassador of our people.  
DOCTOR: What are the Xeraphin doing on Earth, Anithon?  
ANITHON: Our homeland was laid waste by barbarians, so we travelled to this
deserted planet to build a new home for our people.  
TEGAN: That explains the spaceship we saw.  
ANITHON: But the sickness followed us.  
DOCTOR: Radiation poisoning.  
ANITHON: Using our psychic power, we melded into a unity.  
DOCTOR: You achieved the absorption of a whole race into a single bioplasmic
body?  
ANITHON: Yes, Doctor. In that shape we planned to rest until the contamination
had passed. Then we could regenerate.  
DOCTOR: What went wrong?  
ANITHON: At the moment of regeneration the Time Lord came, seeking our power.  
DOCTOR: The Master.  
(Scobie hides as the Master fixes a device to the roof of the sanctum.)  
ANITHON: Those who were first reborn were destroyed.  
DOCTOR: We've seen their remains.  
ANITHON: We were forced to retreat to our resting place.  
DOCTOR: How did the Master gain so much control over your psychic power?  
ANITHON: Through the projection of his mind, he communicated with our
baseness.  
DOCTOR: But surely there's more good than evil in the Xeraphin? And the good
is controlling the power that helped Tegan and Nyssa, and is still resisting
the Master.  
ANITHON: The schismatic effect of the Time Lord's intervention. We are
infinitely divided. (groans) Listen carefully. Together we must secure the
safety of your friends and yourself, and the regeneration of our race.  
DOCTOR: We'll have to deal with the Master first.  
ANITHON: It is possible. I will explain. Argh!  
(Anithon splits into two.)  
ZARAK: I am Zarak, of the race of the Xeraphin.  
(The Master places a second device on the sanctum roof, and plugs his cables
into it.)  
ZARAK: My brother has misled you, Doctor. We need no help. The Xeraphin has a
new destiny.  
ANITHON: No, Zarak. The ambition of the Time Lord will destroy our race.  
ZARAK: For the new to be born, the old must die. The new order of the Xeraphin
has begun.  
ANITHON: No, Zarak.  
ZARAK: Herein the new power, the force that binds and shapes us, shall be
feared and adored. Nations shall prostrate themselves before us. We shall be
divinity.  
DOCTOR: Zarak, that's just a dream. The Master will use the power for his own
evil purposes. He'll never allow you to regenerate.  
ANITHON: Zarak, do you not yearn for shape and touch and feeling? My brother,
our true destiny is the becoming of ourselves. All our power must be combined
to work with the Doctor against the rebel Time Lord.  
NYSSA: I think we're winning.  
TEGAN: Winning what, for heaven's sakes.  
DOCTOR: The argument, of course. The debate between black and white Xeraphin.
Whichever Xeraphin wins will control their combined power.  
NYSSA: For good or for evil.  
ZARAK: You talked me out of my purpose, brother Anithon, but other counsels
will prevail.  
ANITHON: It is forbidden  
ZARAK: In the new order, nothing is forbidden.  
ANITHON: No!  
ZARAK: Come forth, Kalistoran. _Come forth, Alkarim._ Come forth, Vaan.  
TEGAN: (sotto) What's happening now?  
DOCTOR: Zarak is summoning other evil Xeraphin.  
ZARAK: _Come to me, Zarindas._ Come to me, Mordal.  
ANITHON: Help me, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: How can we help you?  
NYSSA: With our minds. We must will the dark Xeraphin not to appear.  
(The Doctor, Tegan and Nyssa lay their hands on the sarcophagus.  
Meanwhile, the Master finishes connecting up his devices with the cable around
the sanctum roof.)  
TEGAN: I cannot keep this up much longer.  
DOCTOR: You must.  
(Zarak fails to divide, and gives up the struggle. The Doctor pulls Nyssa and
Tegan back from the sarcophagus.)  
ANITHON: Zarak, embrace again the eternal truth of the Xeraphin.  
ZARAK: Too late, my brother. The Master is ready for us.  
(The Xeraphin vanish.)  
DOCTOR: The Master's perfected the induction loop.  
(The sarcophagus vanishes.)  
TEGAN: What's happened to the Xeraphin?  
NYSSA: Transferred to the centre of the Master's Tardis.  
TEGAN: What does that mean?  
DOCTOR: It means the Master has finally defeated me.

__**Part Four**__

**[Sanctum]**

NYSSA: That can't be so.  
DOCTOR: With the Xeraphin at the centre of his Tardis, there's no limit to his
powers.  
TEGAN: There must be something we can do. Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Well, it would help if you could remember where you came in.  
NYSSA: Even if we found it, we wouldn't be able to open it with the Xeraphin
gone.  
DOCTOR: Then we have to resort to brute force.  
(The Doctor goes to one of the cluster of crystals.  
In the surrounding chamber, the Master herds the last of the Earthlings into
his Tardis. It dematerialises, leaving Scobie alone.)

**[Tardis]**

BILTON: I thought this thing would never stabilise.  
STAPLEY: I don't think we'll risk touching any more controls. Look for a
radio. Maybe we can send a Mayday signal.  
BILTON: Who's going to answer it?  
STAPLEY: Perhaps the Doctor has a remote navigational  
BILTON: What's the matter, Captain?  
(Bilton turns to see the recently deceased Professor Hayter has come from the
interior of the Tardis.)  
BILTON: Where did you come from?

**[Sanctum]**

TEGAN: Oh, it's no good. The wall's solid.  
NYSSA: We need help from outside.  
TEGAN: Such as?  
NYSSA: The people who let the Doctor in.  
DOCTOR: How do you suggest we make contact?  
(The familiar sound of materialisation fills the room.)  
NYSSA: The Tardis!  
(The Doctor, Nyssa and Tegan hide behind the Tardis until the door opens.)  
DOCTOR: Captain Stapley!  
STAPLEY: Doctor! Am I glad to see you.  
TEGAN: Are we glad to see the Tardis.  
DOCTOR: My dear Captain, you really are the most remarkable man to pilot the
Tardis, and with such precision. Perhaps you could take us to the other side
of that wall.  
STAPLEY: What?  
(Everyone rushes into the Tardis.)  
BILTON: Er

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: You have control, as they say.  
STAPLEY: I can't fly this thing.  
NYSSA: Then how did you pilot it here?  
BILTON: Professor Hayter, of course.  
STAPLEY: Yes. Didn't you instruct Professor Hayter on how to fly the Tardis?  
DOCTOR: No.  
BILTON: Where is the Professor? He was here a moment ago.  
TEGAN: Professor Hayter is dead.  
BILTON: Then what did we see, if it wasn't Hayter?  
DOCTOR: Possibly a telepathic projection. Perhaps he isn't really dead.  
TEGAN: The man was atomised.  
NYSSA: No. He was absorbed into the Xeraphin life force.

**[Sanctum chamber]**

(The Tardis materialises.)  
SCOBIE: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Hello.  
SCOBIE: Captain!  
STAPLEY: Roger, I'm glad you're safe.  
SCOBIE: This place is really getting like Heathrow.  
DOCTOR: Have you seen another Tardis?  
SCOBIE: Would that be something like a Greek pillar?  
DOCTOR: Could well be.  
SCOBIE: Yes, it vanished about ten minutes ago.  
NYSSA: Oh, we've lost him.  
DOCTOR: I don't think so. He's still in this time zone. He can't be far away.  
TEGAN: How do you know that?  
DOCTOR: In it's new state, the Master's Tardis won't be fully operational yet.
He's got the nucleus all right, but he'll need to work on it.  
SCOBIE: What got me was all the people.  
DOCTOR: The passengers.  
SCOBIE: Yes, I mean, I've heard of a football team getting into a telephone
kiosk, but this was ridiculous.  
(The Doctor rushes back into the Tardis, and everyone follows.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Captain, your passengers are now in greater danger than ever before.  
STAPLEY: How?  
DOCTOR: I'll explain later. Nyssa, I want you to take the Tardis back to the
Concorde cargo hold. Captain, I want you and your crew to get your aircraft
ready for takeoff immediately.  
STAPLEY: Doctor, after that landing, I doubt if the aircraft is safe to fly.  
DOCTOR: Wing and a prayer, Captain.  
STAPLEY: Well, if the damage isn't too bad, we could always cannibalise Victor
Foxtrot.  
BILTON: But what about a runway?  
DOCTOR: Well, I'm sure you'll do your very best. Tegan, come with me. Nyssa,
the coordinates are all set.  
(The Doctor and Tegan leave. Nyssa closes the doors.)

**[Sanctum chamber]**

(The Tardis dematerialises.)  
DOCTOR: Keep your eyes open. The Master could be anywhere.

**[Cargo hold]**

(The Tardis parks herself on her back, of course, and the men climb out.)  
STAPLEY: Andrew and I will start with the cockpit check. Roger, I want you to
do a walk round the whole aircraft.  
SCOBIE: Right. Skipper.

**[Chamber]**

TEGAN: He's not here.  
DOCTOR: And taken everything with him, including the bits of my Tardis.  
TEGAN: The passengers, what about them?  
DOCTOR: Molecular disintegration. That way the Master has a neat little store
of protoplasm with which he can do anything he wants.  
TEGAN: What, sort of melt them down?  
DOCTOR: In a manner of speaking. Let's get back to Captain Stapley.

**[** **By Concorde]**

SCOBIE: Well, the brake line's fractured and we've lot a lot of fluid.  
NYSSA: Is that bad?  
SCOBIE: Bad? It's a miracle. The undercarriage itself is virtually undamaged.
We can probably nick the spares from Victor Foxtrot. That's funny.  
NYSSA: What?  
SCOBIE: I thought I saw Victor Foxtrot shimmer. Must be imagining things.

**[Wilderness]**

(On an outcrop overlooking both Concordes.)  
DOCTOR: There's something wrong.  
TEGAN: Well, I can't see anything.  
DOCTOR: No. No, you can't, can you. Come on.

**[** **By Concorde]**

STAPLEY: What's the damage, Roger?  
SCOBIE: Fractured brake line.  
BILTON: Is that all?  
SCOBIE: As far as I can tell. Not a bad landing, Skipper.  
STAPLEY: Can you repair it?  
SCOBIE: With a bit of luck and a bit of Victor Foxtrot. There's only one
problem, though, Skipper. We'll need some compressed air for the start-up.  
STAPLEY: I'll take the tyres off numbers one and four wheels from Victor
Foxtrot.  
BILTON: You what?  
SCOBIE: Skipper, have you any idea how you jack up a hundred tons of aircraft?  
STAPLEY: We did a hole.  
BILTON: What?  
SCOBIE: And with three and two wheels still in place, you don't need to
support the aircraft!  
BILTON: I say, brilliant  
(The Doctor runs up.)  
NYSSA: Where have you been?  
DOCTOR: I'll explain later. Where's my Tardis?  
NYSSA: In the cargo hold, of course.  
DOCTOR: Hmm. Captain, is your aircraft all right?  
STAPLEY: Well, apart from some damage to the hydraulics, but we'll take some
bits off Victor Foxtrot.  
DOCTOR: Ah. Not a good idea.  
NYSSA: But Doctor, it would work.  
DOCTOR: If that were Concorde.  
SCOBIE: But it is Concorde.  
DOCTOR: That aircraft was damaged. Now it's in perfect condition.  
STAPLEY: We must be hallucinating again.  
DOCTOR: I'm afraid not. That's the Master's Tardis.  
SCOBIE: But it's a plane.  
DOCTOR: The Master's operated his chameleon circuit.  
NYSSA: And materialised round the other aircraft.  
STAPLEY: Then Victor Foxtrot  
DOCTOR: Is inside the Master's Tardis, of course. I wish I had time to explain
dimensional transcendentalism. Look, I'm going into my Tardis. You stay here.  
NYSSA: No, Doctor, it's too dangerous.  
DOCTOR: There's no other way.  
STAPLEY: What are you going to do?  
NYSSA: The Doctor's going to materialise round the Master's Tardis.  
TEGAN: You know what happened before.  
DOCTOR: There's no time for anything else.  
(The Concorde Tardis dematerialises.)  
NYSSA: We're too late. With the power of the Xeraphin, the Master will be
invincible.  
DOCTOR: Without the bits he stole from my Tardis, we can only travel in this
time zone.  
TEGAN: We're stuck here?  
DOCTOR: I'm afraid so.  
(Concorde rematerialises.)  
DOCTOR: And so, it would see, is the Master. Come on!

**[By Victor Foxtrot]**

MASTER: Devious to the last, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: A technical hitch?  
MASTER: Your substitution of the temporal limiter for the time lapse
compressor.  
DOCTOR: Ah. Well, that's the way it goes if you will steal other people's
property. (turns around) What's he talking about, Nyssa? Have you been
tampering with the Tardis?  
NYSSA: Of course not.  
DOCTOR: Have you any idea what would have happened if I'd tried to go  
STAPLEY: Doctor. Doctor, I think I can explain.  
DOCTOR: You, Captain?  
STAPLEY: Yes. You see, when we were on the Tardis, I swapped some of the parts
around. I thought it might put a spanner in the works. It's a stupid idea,
really.  
DOCTOR: Stupid? It was brilliant. (to the Master) Your prospects seem rather
limited.  
MASTER: I can still operate my Tardis.  
DOCTOR: Ah, but such a restricted range.  
MASTER: Very well, Doctor. What are your terms?  
DOCTOR: You return all the passengers, we have access to both aircraft, you
return all the components of my Tardis not necessary for the normal
functioning of your machine.  
MASTER: And what will you give me?  
DOCTOR: A temporal limiter.  
NYSSA: Doctor, the nucleus of the Xeraphin.  
DOCTOR: He'll never give that up. Without it his Tardis is useless.  
(The Master nods and leaves.)  
STAPLEY: Has he agreed?  
DOCTOR: Well, we'll know that in a moment.  
BILTON: Look!  
(The Greek column materialises nearby.)  
NYSSA: He's accepted.  
STAPLEY: Is that the Master's Tardis?  
NYSSA: Yes.  
(The passengers start to file out.)  
STAPLEY: I don't believe it.  
BILTON: I think I'd rather hallucinate.  
DOCTOR: Captain, I'll need your aircraft ready for takeoff as soon as
possible.  
STAPLEY: We'll do our best. Roger, Andrew, let's measure this ground for
takeoff.  
DOCTOR: Now, you two. Stay here.  
TEGAN: If the Doctor gives the Master a bit of the Tardis, how do we get back?  
NYSSA: He must be giving him a redundant circuit. You know how the Doctor
collects spare parts.

**[By the Master's Tardis]**

(The Master hands over three circuit boards to the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: You seem to have mislaid the quantum accelerator.  
MASTER: Not at all, Doctor. You shall have it when you give me the correctly
programmed temporal limiter.  
(The Doctor turns to the last batch of passengers.)  
DOCTOR: If you'd be so good as to follow me.  
MASTER: No, Doctor. They shall go when I permit them to.

**[Cargo hold]**

(Scobie tops up Alpha Charlie's brake fluid.)  
STAPLEY: Oh, Doctor, I shall need an external power supply to start the
engines. Four hundred cycles, a hundred and fifteen volts.  
DOCTOR: Right. I'll run a line from the Tardis. Oh, you'll need a compressed
air supply.  
STAPLEY: I'm using the air from the tyres of Victor Foxtrot, and we can take
reducing valves and piping from the air-conditioning system.

**[Tardis]**

(Bilton and Tegan bring Scobie another tyre for the compressed air. Meanwhile,
the Doctor is putting the circuit boards back into the Tardis console.)  
NYSSA: Doctor, you haven't got the quantum accelerator back from the Master.  
DOCTOR: And he hasn't got the temporal limiter. The idea, you see, is to keep
him waiting until we're ready to take off.  
NYSSA: Why do we need Concorde? Can't we all go back in the Tardis?  
DOCTOR: No. I need the Tardis to deal with the Master.  
(The compressed air supply is nearly ready. Nyssa is playing out a roll of
wire.)  
NYSSA: Doctor, how are you doing to deal with the Master? Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I'm thinking about it.

**[GAC flight deck]**

(The Master leaves his Tardis.)  
SCOBIE: Hydraulics fixed.  
NYSSA: External power all right, Captain?  
STAPLEY: Er, yes. Tell the Doctor we're ready, please.  
(Nyssa leaves.)  
STAPLEY: I want to do a final walk round the aircraft while we're waiting for
the Doctor.

**[** **By Concorde]**

MASTER: I'm impatient to leave this place. Tell the Doctor I require the
temporal limiter immediately. Or I shall start to eliminate your passengers.

**[Tardis]**

NYSSA: Captain Stapley says the aircraft is ready.  
DOCTOR: Good. I just need a few more minutes.  
(Tegan runs in.)  
TEGAN: Doctor, hurry up. The Master's getting trigger happy out there.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, we'd better not keep him waiting.

**[** **By Concorde]**

STAPLEY: It looks fine, Roger.  
SCOBIE: There's no guarantee it'll stand up to the takeoff roll. No knowing
what'll happen going over this ground at two hundred knots.  
BILTON: What happens when we get airborne?  
STAPLEY: That rather depends on the Doctor, doesn't it.  
SCOBIE: Let's hope he knows what he's doing.

**[By the Master's Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Please.  
(The remaining passengers leave.)  
MASTER: The quantum accelerator.  
DOCTOR: The temporal limiter.  
(The Master reaches for it. The Doctor pulls it away and puts out his right
hand. They exchange units.)  
MASTER: Thank you. Should I say au revoir, Doctor? Hee hee hee.

**[** **By Concorde]**

(The Master's Tardis dematerialises.)  
STAPLEY: I suppose he could end up anywhere in the universe.  
DOCTOR: Heathrow, actually.  
STAPLEY: What?  
DOCTOR: He's virtually running in a new Tardis. In order to check out the
temporal dimensions, he'll need to track back the line of the time contour.  
BILTON: He'll land up in London with that nucleus on board?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
STAPLEY: But that's disaster!  
DOCTOR: Quite right. Shall we go on board?  
TEGAN: The passengers are coming too?  
STAPLEY: The passengers are your responsibility, Tegan. When you get them on
board, stand by these tyres.  
TEGAN: Ladies and gentlemen, we do apologise for the delay. Your flight is now
ready for boarding. Would you care to proceed to your aircraft immediately?

**[Tardis]**

NYSSA: But the Master'll get to Earth before us.  
DOCTOR: Not with my temporal limiter in circuit.  
NYSSA: Why, doesn't it work?  
DOCTOR: Of course it does. You don't think I could fool the Master, do you?
Mind you, there is an inhibition factor inherent in the er, programming.  
NYSSA: What does that mean?  
DOCTOR: He'll arrive after us.

**[GAC flight deck]**

STAPLEY: Air on number three engine.  
(Tegan switches the valve on the spare tyre.)  
STAPLEY: Start number three engine. (it does) Start number two engine. (it
does) Air off. Get Tegan in here.  
(Tegan runs to the plane.)  
STAPLEY: Start number one engine. Start number four engine. I want reverse
thrust on three and four so I can turn the aircraft and clear that ramp.  
(The Doctor climbs out of the Tardis. Concorde begins to taxi.)  
STAPLEY: I'll abandon takeoff prior to V one only on the loss of two engines.  
DOCTOR: Ready to go?  
STAPLEY: Yes, Doctor. Fasten your seatbelt for takeoff, please. At V two,
we'll maintain our climb-out at theta two, at full power. Cross your fingers.
This is it, gentlemen. Three, two, one, now.  
(Concorde accelerates across the ground. It's a rough ride.)  
SCOBIE: Power checked.  
BILTON: V one. Rotate.  
(Stapley pulls up the controls and Concorde lifts into the air.)  
STAPLEY: What did I tell you, Doctor? Finest aircraft in the world.  
BILTON: V two.  
STAPLEY: Gear up.  
BILTON: Gear selected.  
STAPLEY: Where to now, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Ah. I'll just programme your flight computer.

**[Tardis]**

(Concorde is flying above the cloud layer.)  
DOCTOR: Now, as we dematerialise, we reverse the process of the time contour
and kick Concorde back onto its original flight path.  
(Tegan and Nyssa look at each other.)  
DOCTOR: With a bit of luck.  
(The Tardis dematerialises, taking Concorde with her.)

**[GAC Flight deck]**

(Concorde reappears.)  
STAPLEY: What's happening?  
SCOBIE: The centre of gravity's shifted.  
BILTON: The radio navigation's working!

**[Air Traffic Control]**

(GBOAC suddenly appears on the radar.)  
HORTON: Look!  
SHEARD: It's not possible! From out of nowhere.  
HORTON: Speedbird Concorde Golf Alpha Charlie.

**[GAC Flight deck]**

STAPLEY: Roger. Speedbird Concorde Golf Alpha Charlie descending to three five
zero. We're back!

**[Roof car park]**

(The Tardis materialises overlooking Terminal three.)  
DOCTOR: Well, it's Heathrow Airport. We appear to be on schedule for a change.  
(The Doctor goes back into the Tardis as Concorde comes in to land. Tegan and
Nyssa watch a BA jumbo take off.)  
NYSSA: What a funny way to travel.  
TEGAN: Kind of fun, though.  
NYSSA: You miss it, don't you.  
TEGAN: Oh, I don't know. It's not exactly dull travelling with the Doctor.  
(Two policemen head their way.)  
NYSSA: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Ah. Now what we need's a diversion. Now, with a bit of luck, not to
mention judgement.  
(The Master's Tardis appears, hanging in the air. The Doctor and Nyssa get
back inside the Tardis.)

**[Tardis]**

NYSSA: The Master can't land.  
DOCTOR: No. Same coordinates as the Tardis, but we got here first. Just.  
(The Tardis flickers and the Greek column vanishes.)  
NYSSA: It's gone.  
DOCTOR: Knocked back into time-space like a straight six into the pavilion.  
NYSSA: The Xeraphin will never be able to regenerate.  
DOCTOR: Oh, they stand a much better chance on their own planet.  
NYSSA: You sent them to Xeraphas? But the radiation will  
DOCTOR: That was millions of years ago. The atmosphere will be perfectly clear
by now. Not a very nice climate for the Master, though.  
NYSSA: He'll just take off again.  
DOCTOR: Well, I think with that extra energy on board, my temporal limiter
will need replacing.  
NYSSA: He's stuck on Xeraphas?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Let's hope it's for good. Now, where's Tegan?

**[Terminal One]**

(Tegan is gazing at the International Departures gate.)  
TANNOY: Air Australia announce the departure of flight AS three four two to
Sydney Australia. Will passengers proceed through passport control to gate
fourteen.

**[Office]**

(The crew of GAC are being debriefed.)  
SHEARD: The airline, not to mention Whitehall, is going to need a full
explanation.  
STAPLEY: We did rescue the passengers and crew.  
SCOBIE: And got our own plane back from a time warp.  
SHEARD: Time warp indeed.  
STAPLEY: The Doctor was absolutely right. We've been away for a hundred and
forty million years.  
SCOBIE: What about the overtime?  
SHEARD: You were only missing for twenty four hours. And what about Victor
Foxtrot?  
BILTON: Oh, Victor Foxtrot was never really lost.  
SHEARD: What?  
SCOBIE: Should be on the other side of the sewage farm.  
BILTON: Must have been beside the ruins of the citadel for a hundred and forty
million years.  
STAPLEY: You just have to dig it up.  
(The telephone rings.)  
SHEARD: Yes? Oh, not that police box again.  
STAPLEY: It's the Doctor!

**[Roof car park]**

DOCTOR: Ah, well, really, Officer, we're, we're just in transit, as it were.  
(Sheard, Stapley, Bilton and Scobie come out of the building.)  
DOCTOR: Er, just a, just a. Captain Stapley, I trust you had a good flight?  
STAPLEY: You're amazing, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: (to policeman) Er, you know my friend the Airport Controller. I'm sure
he can give you a full explanation.  
SHEARD: I think I'm entitled to a few explanations.  
DOCTOR: Er, well, I'll just make a quick phone call, which should clear the
whole thing up.  
(The Doctor backs into the Tardis.)  
SHEARD: I thought the Doctor was on Concorde with you?  
STAPLEY: Absolutely, but you see, that police box is really a spaceship in
disguise.  
BILTON: And it's called the Tardis.  
SHEARD: Tardis? Tardis?  
SCOBIE: And it travels in time as well.  
SHEARD: Gentlemen, if you persist with this flippancy, it will be time to talk
about  
(The Tardis dematerialises.)  
SHEARD: Disciplinary action.  
STAPLEY: Happy landings, Doctor.  
(Tegan comes running up.)  
TEGAN: Happy landings, Doctor.  
STAPLEY: Hello. I thought you were going with the Doctor.  
TEGAN: So did I.
