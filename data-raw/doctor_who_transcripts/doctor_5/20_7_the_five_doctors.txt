**The Five Doctors**  
  
Original Airdate: 25 Nov, 1983  

_Transcriber's note - this is the 1999 Special Edition version of the story._

(The late William Hartnell introduces the Doctor Who twentieth anniversary
story.)  
DOCTOR 1: One day, I shall come back. Yes, I shall come back. Until then,
there must be no regrets, no tears, no anxieties. Just go forward in all your
beliefs and prove to me that I am not mistaken in mine.

(On an alien planet, a tall, dark tower rises from a desolate landscape. A
susurration of voices fills the empty, torch-lit corridors.  
Meanwhile, on another planet, Turlough settles down by a ruin to sketch the
peaceful rural landscape. Welcome to Plas Brondanw, Gwynedd.)

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor runs a cloth over his shiny new console, all gleaming metal and
sharp corners with inset control panels. Tegan enters from the interior.)  
TEGAN: Finished?  
DOCTOR 5: Yes. Looks rather splendid, doesn't it?  
TEGAN: But will the Tardis work properly?  
DOCTOR 5: Of course, once everything's run in.  
TEGAN: Didn't you repair anything?  
DOCTOR 5: Well, the Tardis is more than a machine, Tegan. It's like a person.
It needs coaxing, persuading, encouraging.  
TEGAN: You mean it's just as unreliable.  
DOCTOR 5: You have little faith, Tegan.  
(The Doctor pulls the door lever, and they fail to open.)  
TEGAN: Do you blame me?  
(A well aimed thump opens the doors.)

**[Eye of Orion]**

(The Tardis is parked inside the ruins. The Doctor goes out through an archway
to where Turlough is sketching.)  
TURLOUGH: It's marvellous here. I feel so calm and relaxed.  
DOCTOR 5: It's the high bombardment of positive ions.  
TEGAN: It's like Earth after a thunderstorm.  
DOCTOR 5: Same cause and reason.  
TEGAN: It's beautiful.  
DOCTOR 5: For some, the Eye of Orion is the most tranquil place in the
universe.  
TEGAN: Can't we stay here?  
DOCTOR 5: Why not? For a while. We could do with a rest.  
(Somewhere, a gloved hand turns a ball control by an illuminated pentagon with
a model of the tower in the middle. An image of the Dark Tower appears on a
screen, then we go to an enclosed garden where the First Doctor is taking a
stroll. Everyone say Hi! to  Richard Hurndall, who did a magnificent job in
the role. Suddenly he sees a conical object coming at him from the sky. The
elderly gentleman tries to run, but it quickly sweeps him up. The gloved hand
picks up a model of him and places it on one segment of the pentagon.  
The Fifth Doctor clutches his chest in sudden pain.)  
DOCTOR 5: Ah!  
TURLOUGH: Are you all right?  
DOCTOR 5: Just a twinge of cosmic angst.  
TEGAN: Cosmic?  
DOCTOR 5: As if I'd lost something.

**[Colonel's office]**

(Denham Manors, playing UNIT HQ. David Savile, last seen in War Games, is in
Army uniform. He pours a whisky for Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart, who is
retired and in civilian clothes.)  
CRICHTON: Right.  
BRIGADIER: Thank you.  
CRICHTON: Well, to civilian life.  
BRIGADIER: You know, I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to this
reunion. A chance of re-meeting old friends.  
CRICHTON: There was one chap we tried to get hold of. What was his name? Used
to be your scientific advisor.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, the Doctor.  
CRICHTON: Yes that's right.  
BRIGADIER: Wonderful chap. All of them.  
CRICHTON: Them?  
(The intercom beeps.)  
CRICHTON: Yes?  
SERGEANT [OC]: Excuse me, sir, sorry to interrupt. Someone's arrived.  
CRICHTON: I'm not expecting anyone.

**[Outer office]**

SERGEANT: Insists on seeing Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart.  
CRICHTON [OC]: How did he know he was here?  
(A figure in a big fur coat heads for the door.)  
SERGEANT: I'm sorry, sir, you're not allowed in there.  
DOCTOR 2: Not allowed? Me? I'm allowed everywhere.

**[Colonel's office]**

(The Sergeant grabs at the Doctor's coat. The Doctor does a neat turn
resulting in him taking the coat off.)  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, thank you. Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER: Good heavens. Is it you?  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, yes. For once, I was able to steer the Tardis. And here I am.  
CRICHTON: It's all right, Sergeant.  
SERGEANT: Very good, sir.  
(The Sergeant hangs up the Doctor's coat and leaves.)  
DOCTOR 2: I'm not too late, am I?  
BRIGADIER: What for?  
DOCTOR 2: For your speech as guest of honour.  
BRIGADIER: How did you know?  
DOCTOR 2: I saw it in the Times.  
CRICHTON: That's impossible. The reporter's still here.  
DOCTOR 2: Tomorrow's Times. And, er, and who is this?  
BRIGADIER: That's Colonel Crichton, my replacement.  
DOCTOR 2: Ah. Yes, mine was pretty unpromising, too.  
BRIGADIER: Come along, Doctor, we'll take a stroll round the ground, shall we?
Awfully sorry about this. Do excuse me for a moment. DOCTOR 2: You've had this
place redecorated, haven't you? Hmm. Don't like it.  
(The Brigadier collects their coats and goes to the French windows.)  
BRIGADIER: Come along, Doctor.  
DOCTOR 2: After you.  
BRIGADIER: What?  
DOCTOR 2: After you.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, very well.  
(Outside, the Brigadier helps the Doctor on with his coat. The Sergeant
enters.)  
SERGEANT: Everything all right, sir?  
CRICHTON: What the blazes is going on? Who was that strange little man?  
SERGEANT: The Doctor.  
CRICHTON: Who?

**[Outside UNIT HQ]**

(The Doctor fastens his coat with a piece of string.)  
BRIGADIER: Yes. Yeti, Cybermen. We've seen some times, Doctor.  
DOCTOR 2: And Omega. Don't forget Omega.  
BRIGADIER: As if I could!  
DOCTOR 2: And the terrible Zodin.  
BRIGADIER: Who?  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, you weren't concerned with her, were you? She happened in the
future. They were covered in hair. Used to hop like kangaroos. Well, I must
say goodbye, Brigadier. I really shouldn't be here at all. I'm not exactly
breaking the laws of time, but I am bending them a little.  
BRIGADIER: You never did bother much about rules, as I remember. What's the
matter?  
(The conical object is heading their way.)  
BRIGADIER: What is it?  
DOCTOR 2: Brigadier, I think our past is catching up on us. Or maybe it's our
future. Come on, run!  
(They run for the trees.)  
BRIGADIER: Doctor, I'm too old for his sort of thing.  
DOCTOR 2: Where's it gone? We must get back to the Tardis before it's too
late. Run!  
(But the cone gets them both. The gloved hand places two figures in another
section of the pentagon.)

**[Eye of Orion]**

TEGAN: Doctor, what is it?  
DOCTOR 5: It's fading. It's all fading.  
TURLOUGH: What's fading?  
DOCTOR 5: Great chunks of my past, detaching themselves like melting icebergs.
Ah!  
(More pain.)  
TEGAN: Do something. Help him!  
DOCTOR 5: Oh, no. No, don't look so worried. I'll have it all worked out soon.
Everything's all right. Everything's quite all right.  
(The Doctor puts his hands on Turlough and Tegan's shoulders, and collapses.)

**[Country road]**

(The Third Doctor is driving along in Bessie when he sees the cone coming for
him.)  
DOCTOR 3: Great balls of fire!  
(He turns Bessie around in a junction and floors the accelerator. After a few
moments he loses sight of the cone in his wing mirror.) DOCTOR 3: Good old
Bessie.  
(And promptly gets swept up and taken away.  
The gloved hand places his model in the third segment of the pentagon.)

**[Eye of Orion]**

TEGAN: What's happening to him? What are we going to do?  
TURLOUGH: He seems to be under some kind of psychic attack.  
DOCTOR 5: I am being diminished. Whittled away, piece by piece. A man is the
sum of his memories, you know. A Time Lord even more so.  
TEGAN: What can we do to help you?  
DOCTOR 5: Get me into the Tardis.  
(They carry him back into the ruins.)  
DOCTOR 5: Ah! I have to find, to find  
TURLOUGH: Find what?  
DOCTOR 5: My other selves.

**[West Common Road, Uxbridge]**

(Sarah Jane Smith comes out of her house. K9 trundles down the driveway.)  
K9: Mistress, do not go out.  
SARAH: What is it?  
K9: Danger, Mistress.  
SARAH: What?  
K9: I can sense danger, Mistress. Telepathic trace faint but rapidly
increasing in strength. Do not go out.  
SARAH: What kind of danger?  
K9: Positive data not yet available.  
SARAH: Well, I can't stay home. You have to give me a reason.  
K9: Negative, Mistress. Data analysis shows too many variables. Danger
readings now becoming much higher, Mistress. Suggestion. Take me with you.  
SARAH: I can't. Honestly, I can't. The car's in docks so I've got to go by
bus.  
K9: There is danger, Mistress. My sensors indicate it is now extreme. And the
Doctor is involved.  
SARAH: Well, now I know you're imagining things. See you later.  
(She crosses the road.)  
K9: Danger! Doctor! Danger! Mistress!

**[River Cam]**

(This scene is lifted from Shada, where the Fourth Doctor and the First Romana
are punting.)  
DOCTOR 4: Wordsworth, Rutherford, Christopher Smart, Andrew Marvell, Judge
Jeffreys, Owen Chadwick.  
ROMANA: Who?  
DOCTOR 4: Owen Chadwick. Oh, yes, some of the greatest labourers in the
history of Earth have thought here.  
ROMANA: Newton, of course.  
DOCTOR 4: Oh, definitely Newton.  
ROMANA: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  
DOCTOR 4: That's right.  
ROMANA: So, Newton invented punting.  
DOCTOR 4: Oh, yes. There was no limit to Isaac's genius.  
ROMANA: Isn't it wonderful how something so primitive can be so  
DOCTOR 4: Restful?  
ROMANA: No, simple. You just push in one direction and the boat goes in the
other. Oh, I do love the spring. All the leaves, the colours.  
DOCTOR 4: It's October.  
ROMANA: I thought you said we were coming here for May week.  
DOCTOR 4: I did. May week's in June.  
ROMANA: I'm confused.  
DOCTOR 4: So was the Tardis.  
ROMANA: Oh, I do love the autumn. All the leaves, the colours.  
DOCTOR 4: Yes. Well, at least with something as simple as a punt nothing can
go wrong. No co-ordinates, no dimensional stabilisers, nothing. Just the
water, the punt, a strong pair of hands and a pole.  
(The pole becomes stuck as they go under another bridge. The cone comes down
and whisks them both away.  
The gloved hand punches frustratedly at its controls as the image refuses to
become a model.)

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor sets the Tardis in flight, then falls backwards into Turlough's
arms.)  
TEGAN: Oh no!  
(Sarah gets to her bus stop then sees the cone coming, but she cannot get
away. Her model is placed with the Third Doctor's on the pentagon.)  
TEGAN: Two hearts.  
TURLOUGH: Well, his body's all right. He just seems to be fading away. Why did
he have to set the Tardis moving? We were safe before he did that.  
TEGAN: Look  
(The Doctor starts to fade in and out.)  
TEGAN: Doctor?  
(The time rotor stops moving.)  
TEGAN: What's going on?  
TURLOUGH: We've landed.  
(Turlough turns on the scanner to show the desolate place with the Dark Tower
in the distance.  
The gloved hand places three figures in the fifth section of the pentagon
whilst the fourth flashes on and off.)  
TURLOUGH: According to the instruments, we're nowhere, in no time.  
TEGAN: The Doctor must have forgotten to reconnect something.  
TURLOUGH: No. The instruments are all working perfectly. They just won't tell
us anything. The Tardis is paralysed.  
TEGAN: How did we get here? What do we do now?  
TURLOUGH: We wait until the Doctor recovers.  
TEGAN: And if he doesn't?

**[Conference room]**

(The Lord President of the High Council of Time Lords enters a room where a
man and a woman are already seated at a table.)  
BORUSA: Well?  
CASTELLAN: He has arrived.  
BORUSA: Involving this person does not please me.  
CASTELLAN: The constitution clearly states that when in emergency session, the
members of the inner council are unanimous  
FLAVIA: Which indeed we are  
BORUSA: The President of the Council may be overruled. What a ridiculous
clause. Very well, have him enter.  
CASTELLAN: With all due respect, Lord President, your regeneration has not
helped your stubbornness.  
(Citadel guards open the doors and the Master enters.)  
MASTER: Lord President, Castellan, Chancellor Flavia. This is a very great
and, may I say, a most unexpected honour. I may be seated? Now then, what can
I do for you?  
BORUSA: You are one of the most evil and corrupt beings this Time Lord race
has ever produced. Your crimes are without number and your villainy without
end. Nevertheless, we are prepared to offer you a full and free pardon.  
MASTER: What makes you think I want your forgiveness?  
CASTELLAN: We can offer you an alternative to your renegade existence.  
BORUSA: Regeneration. A complete new life cycle.  
MASTER: What must I do?  
BORUSA: Rescue the Doctor.  
MASTER: What?

**[Metallic corridor]**

(Thunder crashes outside and lightning reflects off the irregular walls of the
zigzagging corridors. The First Doctor is walking through them when he sees a
shadow.)  
DOCTOR 1: Susan. Surely it's Susan.  
SUSAN: Grandfather. Oh, Grandfather!  
(They embrace.)  
SUSAN: Thank goodness I've found you. How did we get here? What's happening?  
DOCTOR 1: I wish I knew, my dear.  
SUSAN: As soon as I found myself in this horrible place I started looking for
you. Somehow I knew I'd find you here.  
DOCTOR 1: Well, the important question now is where are we, and why?  
(The shadow of a Dalek appears on another wall.)  
SUSAN: (sotto) We must be on Skaro.  
DOCTOR 1: (sotto) We were brought here. Perhaps the Dalek was, too.  
(The Dalek comes round the corner.)  
SUSAN: Run, Grandfather!  
DALEK: Halt at once. Halt or you will be exterminated. It is the Doctor. The
Doctor must be destroyed. Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate!  
(The Dalek fires its gun at random.)

**[Conference room]**

(An image of a pentagonal area surrounded by mountains and with the Dark Tower
in the middle is on a large screen.)  
BORUSA: The Death Zone.  
MASTER: Ah., the black secret at the heart of your Time Lord paradise.  
CASTELLAN: Recently, the Zone has become reactivated. Somehow, it is draining
energy from the Eye of Harmony.  
FLAVIA: To an extent which endangers all Gallifrey.  
BORUSA: We must know what is happening there.  
MASTER: Did it occur to you to go and look?  
BORUSA: Two of the High Council went into the Zone. Neither returned.  
MASTER: So you sent for the Doctor?  
CASTELLAN: We looked for the Doctor, but he no longer exists. Not in any of
his regenerations.  
BORUSA: The Doctor has been taken out of time.  
(An image of the Fourth Doctor and Romana appears on the screen.)  
CASTELLAN: We believe the attempt to lift him from his time stream was
unsuccessful. There he must stay until we can find and free his other selves.  
MASTER: And if you cannot? The cosmos without the Doctor scarcely bares
thinking about. What makes you think his other selves are in the Zone?  
BORUSA: Their time traces. They converge there.  
MASTER: And you can get me into the Zone?  
CASTELLAN: We have a power-boosted, open-ended transmat beam.  
MASTER: Ah. Why me?  
BORUSA: Because we need someone determined, experienced, ruthless, cunning.  
MASTER: And disposable?  
CASTELLAN: Not at all. You would be useless to us dead.  
FLAVIA: Will you go?  
BORUSA: Will you?  
MASTER: And rescue the Doctor.  
(The Master laughs.)

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor has disappeared completely.)  
TEGAN: Come on, Doctor.  
TURLOUGH: Hold on!  
(The Doctor reappears.)  
TEGAN: What's happening to you?  
DOCTOR 5: I'm being sucked into a time vortex. Part of me there already. It's
pulling the rest. I must send a signal.  
TEGAN: What signal?  
DOCTOR 5: I must send a signal. Find them. I must be whole.

**[Metallic corridor]**

(The First Doctor and Susan are tiring.)  
DALEK: Halt at once or you will be exterminated. Halt! Halt! Obey. Obey the
Daleks. You will be exterminated. Exterminate! Exterminate!  
SUSAN: Oh, It's a dead end!  
DOCTOR 1: That may be precisely what we need.  
SUSAN: No, Grandfather, come on, please!  
DOCTOR 1: No, no, no, don't argue, Susan. Listen to me. Now, when I say now,
help me to push the Dalek down that alley, and when I say drop, drop.
Understood?  
(They hide behind a jutting section of wall. The Dalek appears.)  
DOCTOR 1: Now, Susan!  
(They push the Dalek into the dead end.)  
DALEK: Under attack!  
DOCTOR 1: Drop!  
DALEK: Under attack!  
(The Dalek fires in the three-sided area, causing multiple ricochets of its
energy weapon.)  
DALEK: Exterminate! Under attack! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!  
(Finally a ricochet hits the Dalek, and it blows up. The explosion rips a hole
in the wall to the outside. The mutant Kaled inside the casing writhes for a
few moments, then dies.)  
DOCTOR 1: It's very dangerous to fire energy weapons in an enclosed space.  
SUSAN: Look!  
DOCTOR 1: The Dark Tower.  
SUSAN: We're on Gallifrey.  
DOCTOR 1: The Death Zone.  
SUSAN: Why were we brought here?  
DOCTOR 1: Instinct, my dear, tells me that the answer to that lies in the
Tower.

**[Death Zone section 2]**

(A slate quarry.)  
BRIGADIER: Charming spot, Doctor.  
DOCTOR 2: My dear Brigadier, it's no use blaming me.  
BRIGADIER: You attract trouble, Doctor. You always did. Where the devil are
we?  
DOCTOR 2: I'm not sure, but I have some very nasty suspicions. What's that?  
BRIGADIER: Huh?  
DOCTOR 2: Over there.  
(The Second Doctor points to a silvery figure in the mist.)  
BRIGADIER: There's something moving.  
DOCTOR 2: No, get down.  
(They crouch down beside an old wall, where a silver hand reaches through and
grabs the Brigadier's arm. He calls out in pain and the Doctor tries to pull
him away in vain.)  
DOCTOR 2: Don't worry, Brigadier.  
(The Doctor finds a metal bar and hits the silver hand with it until it lets
go.)  
DOCTOR 2: Run!

**[Death Zone section 3]**

(The Doctor stops Bessie on a track along the side of a hill.)  
DOCTOR 3: Now what?  
(He hears a scream as Sarah falls off the edge of the road in the mist and
rolls down the slope.)  
SARAH: Oh. Oh, K9, why didn't I listen to you?  
DOCTOR 3: Hang on a minute.  
(The Doctor gets out a coil of rope and ties one end to Bessie's front
chassis.)  
DOCTOR 3: Catch hold of this.  
(He throws the other end down to Sarah then loops it round a convenient
boulder while she ties it around her waist. Then he reverses Bessie slowly,
pulling Sarah up the slope.)  
SARAH: Oh, I never thought I'd be so pleased to see anyone.  
DOCTOR 3: I think we should come away from the ledge, don't you?  
SARAH: Wait a moment. It's you.  
DOCTOR 3: Of course it's me. Hello, Sarah Jane.  
SARAH: No, no, it's you you.  
DOCTOR 3: That's right.  
SARAH: No. No, you changed remember? You became all, er  
DOCTOR 3: Teeth and curls?  
SARAH: Yes.  
DOCTOR 3: Yes, well, maybe I did, but I haven't yet.  
SARAH: Oh, I see. No, I don't. Never mind. Yes, well, thank you very much for
rescuing me, Doctor, and now perhaps you'll explain why I'm here to need
rescuing.  
DOCTOR 3: Steady on, Sarah Jane. I'm not exactly here by choice either, you
know.  
SARAH: Then, what are we doing here?  
DOCTOR 3: Well, I'll try and explain. Come on, get in the car.

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor stands up, with assistance.)  
DOCTOR 5: I've got to. What is it I've got to do?  
TEGAN: You said something about a signal.  
TURLOUGH: About being whole.  
DOCTOR 5: Ah yes, of course. A recall signal.  
TEGAN: What's the signal for, Doctor? Who's it to?  
DOCTOR 5: I must send the signal. They'll hear it. That'll bring them.  
TEGAN: Doctor, tell where the signal control is so we can help you.  
DOCTOR 5: It's, it's  
(The Doctor collapses.)

**[Death Zone section 5]**

(The First Doctor and Susan are walking over scrubby moorland.)  
DOCTOR 1: Oh, it's no good. I shall have to rest.  
SUSAN: Oh, yes, of course, Grandfather. I'll just go and take another look.  
DOCTOR 1: Yes, yes.  
(Susan walks on a little way.)  
SUSAN: Look. Come and see.  
DOCTOR 1: Hmm? What? Goodness me! The Tardis!  
SUSAN: What's it doing here?  
DOCTOR 1: I suggest we go and find out.

**[Tardis]**

TEGAN: He's only just about conscious.  
TURLOUGH: If only he'd managed to send that signal.  
(The First Doctor and Susan walk in. Susan closes the doors.)  
TEGAN: Who are you?  
DOCTOR 1: More to the point, what are you young people doing inside my Tardis?  
TEGAN: It's his Tardis.  
DOCTOR 1: And who might he be?  
TURLOUGH: The Doctor.  
DOCTOR 1: Hmm? Good grief.  
(The Fifth Doctor opens his eyes.)  
DOCTOR 5: You're here. You're here.  
DOCTOR 1: Yes, evidently. Now, take it steadily, my boy, and let me help you
up.  
DOCTOR 5: I tried to send a recall signal.  
DOCTOR 1: Yes, it doesn't matter. How do you come to be here?  
DOCTOR 5: Well, the Tardis was, er. I don't know.  
DOCTOR 1: Never mind that.  
SUSAN: Is he really  
DOCTOR 1: Me? Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so. Regeneration?  
DOCTOR 5: Fourth.  
DOCTOR 1: Goodness me! So, there are five of me now! Oh, er, this is Susan.  
DOCTOR 5: Yes, I know.  
DOCTOR 1: And, er, you two are  
TURLOUGH: Turlough.  
TEGAN: And I'm Tegan Jovanka. Who might you be?  
DOCTOR 1: I might be any number of things, young lady. As it happens, I am the
Doctor. The original, you might say.  
TEGAN: But you shouldn't be here at the same time, with him, should you?  
DOCTOR 1: Certainly not.  
DOCTOR 5: It only happens in the gravest emergencies.  
DOCTOR 1: Like now.  
DOCTOR 5: Yes, unfortunately.  
DOCTOR 1: Now look, young lady. Make yourself useful. This young fellow looks
as though he needs some refreshment and I know that Susan and I do, too.  
TEGAN: Hang on a minute.  
DOCTOR 5: Tegan, Tegan, Tegan. Humour him. You know, I sometimes used to get a
little tetchy. Fortunately one mellows with age. Turlough will help.  
TURLOUGH: Thank you.  
(Tegan and Turlough go into the interior.)  
DOCTOR 1: And now, young fellow, tell me all about it.

**[Conference room]**

FLAVIA: The Seal of the High Council. It may help to convince the Doctors of
your good faith.  
MASTER: Perhaps.  
CASTELLAN: It's time to go. When you have something to tell us, activate this.  
(The Castellan gives the Master a round device with a small button on it.)  
CASTELLAN: We will pick up your signal and transmat you back.  
MASTER: Isn't anyone going to wish me luck?  
BORUSA: We wish you success, for all our sakes.  
(The Master steps back into the transmat cubicle. The Castellan operates it
and the Master disappears.)  
CASTELLAN: And now, we wait.  
BORUSA: I would prefer to wait alone.  
(Borusa puts his hand on a harp, which stands near a large painting on the
wall of a Time Lord playing a harp.)

**[Death Zone]**

(The Master nudges a skeleton with his foot.)  
MASTER: One of my predecessors.  
(An energy bolt comes out of the sky and hits near him.)  
MASTER: Not the most hospitable of environments.

**[Death Zone section 2]**

(The Dark Tower is visible on the horizon.)  
DOCTOR 2: It's just as I feared. We're on Gallifrey, in the Death Zone.  
BRIGADIER: You know this place?  
DOCTOR 2: To my shame. Yes, mine, Brigadier, and that of every other Time
Lord. In the days before Rassilon, my ancestors had tremendous powers which
they misused disgracefully. They set up this place, the Death Zone, and walled
it around with an impenetrable force field, and then they kidnapped other
beings and set them down here.  
BRIGADIER: But what for?  
DOCTOR 2: I'll explain as we go.  
BRIGADIER: Where are we going?  
DOCTOR 2: To the Tower. To Rassilon, the greatest single figure in Time Lord
history.  
BRIGADIER: Is that where he lives?  
DOCTOR 2: Not exactly, Brigadier. It's his tomb.

**[Tardis]**

(Turlough and Tegan have rustled up some exotic looking food, which they and
Susan are now devouring.)  
DOCTOR 1: You're talking nonsense, my boy. We must send the signal as planned
and wait for the others.  
DOCTOR 5: No, there's no time. We must leave immediately. Temporal
instability's already affecting me.  
DOCTOR 1: And without our other selves, we'll be of little use out there.  
DOCTOR 5: Well, they'll never make it. There is evil at work.  
TEGAN: Evil?  
DOCTOR 1: We're in the Death Zone on Gallifrey.  
TURLOUGH: How can you be so sure?  
DOCTOR 5: Well, the Tomb of Rassilon. Look, can we really afford to wait,
especially if someone is tapping his power?  
DOCTOR 1: Well, what do you intend to do, young man?  
DOCTOR 5: I shall go to the Tower.  
DOCTOR 1: But there could be great danger.  
DOCTOR 5: Help me set up the computer scanner. We can at least see what is out
there.

**[Death Zone section 3]**

(Driving along in Bessie.)  
DOCTOR 3: All this was the setting for the games. But old Rassilon put a stop
to it in the end. He sealed off the entire Zone and forbade the use of the
Time Scoop, until now.  
SARAH: But why don't they just tell us why we're here?  
(The Doctor stops Bessie.)  
DOCTOR 3: Because they delight in deviousness, that's why. It amuses them,
chucking us in the deep end, watching us sink or swim.  
SARAH: Why have we stopped?  
DOCTOR 3: So I can get my bearings. Ah ha. There it is.  
SARAH: What?  
DOCTOR 3: The Tomb of Rassilon. That's where we're going.  
SARAH: Look, do you think this is wise, Doctor? I mean, well, whatever's in
that Tower, it's got enormous powers and, well, what can we do against it?  
DOCTOR 3: What I've always done, Sarah Jane. Improvise.  
(Further along the road, the Master spots them and waves.)  
MASTER: Doctor, wait!  
(The Doctor slams on the brakes.)  
SARAH: Who's that?  
DOCTOR 3: I don't know. No, it couldn't be.  
(They back up to the Master.)  
DOCTOR 3: Jehosophat, it really is you. Yes, well, I should have known you'd
be behind all this.  
SARAH: Doctor, who is it?  
DOCTOR 3: That's my best enemy. He likes to be known as the Master, don't you?
My, my, my, but you've changed. Another regeneration?  
MASTER: Not exactly.  
DOCTOR 3: I take it you are responsible for our being in the Death Zone?  
MASTER: For once, I'm innocent, here at the High Council's request to help
you, and your other selves.  
DOCTOR 3: You? Sent here by the Time Lords to help me? I've never heard such
arrant nonsense.  
MASTER: I happen to be telling the truth. I carry the Seal of the High
Council.  
DOCTOR 3: Yes, forged, no doubt.  
MASTER: See for yourself.  
(The Doctor examines the Seal.)  
DOCTOR 3: Stolen, then. I'll return it at the first opportunity.  
MASTER: If you would only listen, I'm here to help.  
DOCTOR 3: You? Help me? Rubbish. This is some kind of a trap.  
MASTER: I knew this was going to be difficult, but I didn't realise that even
you would be so stupid as to make it impossible.  
(The Master moves just as another energy bolt hits the ground.)  
DOCTOR 3: I knew it, a trap.  
MASTER: These thunderbolts are everywhere.  
SARAH: No, we can't leave him.  
DOCTOR 3: You just watch me.  
(The Doctor drives off and a bolt hits the road in front of them. The Master
runs for his life with explosions at his heels.)

**[Tardis]**

(A diagram of the Dark Tower is drawn on a console monitor.)  
DOCTOR 5: Now, as far as I can make out, there are three entrances. One above,
one below, and the main door here.  
DOCTOR 1: Which do you plan to use?  
DOCTOR 5: Er, well, the main door.  
DOCTOR 1: I still think you should wait.  
DOCTOR 5: There may be very little time.  

**[Death Zone section 3]**

(The Third Doctor and Sarah walk away from the smoking remains of Bessie.)  
DOCTOR 3: You see what I mean? A trap.

**[Conference room]**

(The wavy image of the Fourth Doctor is being worked on.)  
BORUSA: Is there nothing you can do to retrieve him?  
TECHNICIAN: Nothing, my Lord President. With the present energy drain, it is
beyond our resources.  
BORUSA: You use what spare energy you have to stabilise that portion of the
vortex in which he is trapped. It may at least give the remaining Doctors more
time.  
TECHNICIAN: Lord President.  
(The technician leaves and the Castellan enters.)  
CASTELLAN: No news from the Master?  
BORUSA: Did you really think that there would be?

**[Death Zone section 2]**

DOCTOR 2: I wonder, could Rassilon himself have brought us here?  
BRIGADIER: Hang on a minute, Doctor. You said this chap Rassilon was dead. You
did say that was his tomb?  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, it is, but no one really knows how extensive his powers were.  
BRIGADIER: He could still be alive?  
DOCTOR 2: Watching us at this very moment.  
BRIGADIER: Didn't you say he was supposed to be rather a good type?  
DOCTOR 2: So the official history says, but there are many rumours and legends
to the contrary. Some say his fellow Time Lords rebelled against his cruelty
and locked him in the Tower in eternal sleep.  
BRIGADIER: And now he's woken up again?  
DOCTOR 2: Well, it would explain a great deal. Oh dear.  
BRIGADIER: Hmm?  
DOCTOR 2: We could be playing the Game of Rassilon at this very moment.  
BRIGADIER: Your tone doesn't inspire much confidence. I assume we're not
expected to win.  
DOCTOR 2: Come on.

**[Tardis]**

TURLOUGH: Even if you. Even if you reach this Tower, what are you going to do?  
DOCTOR 5: Er, release the Tardis. The computer scanner's located the force
field generator.  
SUSAN: I'll come with you.  
DOCTOR 5: Hmm.  
TEGAN: I'd like to come, too.  
DOCTOR 1: No. I think it would be safer if you were to remain here with me.  
TEGAN: I'd like to go with him.  
DOCTOR 5: Er, yes, yes, all right. Now, you'll bring the Tardis to the Tower
as soon as I switch off the force field.  
DOCTOR 1: Of course.  
DOCTOR 5: Yes, of course. Right, better get started. Time's running out.  
(The door control works first time.)  
DOCTOR 5: Eureka.  
(The First Doctor samples Tegan's cooking, and approves.)

**[Death Zone section 3]**

(The Third Doctor and Sarah are walking up a wooded slope.)  
SARAH: I thought we were going to the Tower.  
DOCTOR 3: We are.  
SARAH: Then why this way?  
DOCTOR 3: Because the mountains are between us and the Tower, Sarah. That's
why.  
SARAH: Can't you find an easier way?  
DOCTOR 3: No, it'd take far too long.  
(They see a Cyberman patrol down below them.)  
DOCTOR 3: So, the Master has used the Time Scoop to bring others as well as us
here. Come on, let's get out of here.

**[Tardis]**

TURLOUGH: Do you think it will take the Doctor long to reach the Tower?  
DOCTOR 1: It depends on what may try to stop him, my boy. Oh, it's not without
reason that it's called the Death Zone. Great heavens. Two more traces.  
TURLOUGH: Time Lords?  
DOCTOR 1: Two more Doctors. The scanner is keyed to my, to our brain patterns.
Well, well, well, so two of them made it. I wonder what happened to the other.

**[Base of the Dark Tower]**

DOCTOR 2: (singing) Who to Rassilon's Tower would go, must choose below. No,
no, no Who unto Rassilon's Tower will go, must choose above, between, below.  
BRIGADIER: Are you in pain, Doctor?  
DOCTOR 2: Age has not mellowed you, has it, Brigadier? I was recalling, in
point of fact, an old nursery rhyme about the Dark Tower.  
BRIGADIER: Does it help?  
DOCTOR 2: Considerably more than you do. It describes the different ways to
enter the Tower.  
BRIGADIER: A nursery rhyme? I never heard anything so ridiculous.  
DOCTOR 2: Nevertheless, I propose to put it to the test.  
(They have reached a burning beacon. The Doctor takes one of a pair of metal
'torches' and lights it from the fire.)  
DOCTOR 2: Come along. In here.  
(They go into a cave entrance, dripping with water.)

**[Death Zone section 5]**

DOCTOR 5: Soon be there.  
SUSAN: I'm finding this quite exhilarating.  
TEGAN: I wish I were.  
MASTER: Doctor.  
TEGAN: The Master.  
DOCTOR 5: Wait here.  
(The Fifth Doctor walks down the slope to the Master.)  
MASTER: I know this is going to be hard to believe, Doctor, but for once I
mean you no harm.  
DOCTOR 5: Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before
breakfast. Go on.  
MASTER: I've been sent here by the High Council to help you.  
(A Cyberman walks around a rocky outcrop a little way away and sees them. He
walks back.)  
SUSAN: Is this man a friend of the Doctor's?  
TEGAN: Anything but.  
SUSAN: Well, they're talking as if they were friends.  
TEGAN: That's what worries me.  
(The Cyberman reports to his patrol leader.)  
CYBERMAN: I have found the ones from the Tardis.  
LEADER: Excellent.  
CYBERMAN 2: I shall take the patrol and destroy them.  
LEADER: No. Capture them alive. They must be interrogated first.  
CYBERMAN 2: Leader.  
LEADER: We also need the Time Lord to pilot the Tardis. Go.  
CYBERMAN 2: (to other Cybermen) Here are your orders.  
(Meanwhile, on the other side of the outcrop.)  
MASTER: Be reasonable, Doctor.  
DOCTOR 5: I am. I listened.  
(The Master reveals the Tissue Compression Eliminator.)  
MASTER: As you see, I'm armed. I could easily kill you if I wanted to.  
DOCTOR 5: And not humiliate me first? Oh, that isn't your style at all.  
MASTER: I also have a recall device that'll take me back to the conference
room in the heart of the Capitol.  
DOCTOR 5: So you say. I would prefer more positive proof of your credentials.  
MASTER: One of your other selves took it from me.  
DOCTOR 5: Do you expect me to believe the fantastic tale you've just told?  
TEGAN: Doctor, look out! Cybermen!  
DOCTOR 5: Go back!  
SUSAN: Well, we can't just leave him.  
TEGAN: We can't help him, either. Do as he says. We must warn the others.  
(Tegan runs off.)  
DOCTOR 5: After you.  
(The Master runs with the Doctor at his heels.)  
CYBERMAN 2: Halt! Halt, or you will be destroyed.  
(The energy bolt lands ahead of the pair of Time Lords. The Master is knocked
out by a flying fragment of rock.)  
DOCTOR 5: Zapped.  
CASTELLAN [OC]: All available power to transmat beam.

**[Conference room]**

CASTELLAN: Locked on.

**[Death Zone section 5]**

CASTELLAN [OC]: Prepare to retrieve the Master.  
(The Fifth Doctor picks up the beeping recall device.)  
CYBERMAN 2: You will accompany us.  
CASTELLAN [OC]: Transference now.  
DOCTOR 5: Sorry, must dash.  
(The Doctor presses the button and vanishes.)  
TEGAN: Susan, come on!  
(Susan trips over a protruding piece of rock.)  
SUSAN: Ow!  
TEGAN: Can you walk?  
SUSAN: Ow, just about.

**[Conference room]**

(The Inner Council are gathered when the transmat delivers the Fifth Doctor.)  
DOCTOR 5: Quite a reception committee.

**[Death Zone section 5]**

(The Master wakes.)  
CYBERMAN 2: This is not the Doctor.  
LEADER: Take him.  
MASTER: Oof. I've been looking for you.  
LEADER: Kill him!  
MASTER: I'm here as your friend.  
LEADER: Who are you?  
MASTER: I am the Master, and your loyal servant.

**[Tardis]**

(Tegan is bandaging Susan's ankle while the First Doctor is updated on
events.)  
DOCTOR 2: And then?  
SUSAN: Then he just disappeared.  
DOCTOR 1: Hmm.  
TURLOUGH: What could have happened?  
DOCTOR 1: Well, from the way Susan described it, a transmat device.  
TEGAN: Yes, but he must have got it from the Master.  
SUSAN: I do hope he's all right.  
DOCTOR 1: Well, with our young friend gone, I shall have to go to the Dark
Tower.  
TEGAN: I'll come with you.  
DOCTOR 1: Oh. Oh, well, if you must. Thank you, my dear.

**[Conference room]**

DOCTOR 5: It seems I've done the Master an injustice.  
BORUSA: If he survived, I'm sure he will learn to live with the misjudgment.  
DOCTOR 5: Well, this changes things. If the Master isn't responsible, then who
is misusing the Death Zone?  
CASTELLAN: We were hoping you could tell us. You have been there.  
DOCTOR 5: Who has control of the Time Scoop?  
BORUSA: No one. Its use is prohibited.  
DOCTOR 5: But the machinery still exists.  
BORUSA: Doctor, you seem to be implying that the Time Scoop was used to bring
you.  
DOCTOR 5: Yes, I am rather.  
FLAVIA: Then you accuse a Time Lord.  
DOCTOR 5: I think it would be quite an important one, as well.  
BORUSA: You have evidence, of course.  
DOCTOR 5: No. No, not yet.  
BORUSA: Then upon what do you base this outrageous accusation?  
DOCTOR 5: Cybermen. Whoever brought me and my other selves here also brought
them. Now, you know our legends well enough. Even in our most corrupt period
our ancestors never allowed the Cybermen to play the game. Like the Daleks,
they play too well.  
CASTELLAN: Hardly proof of a traitor.  
DOCTOR 5: Then there's this. You know, the Death Zone is a large place, and
yet the Cybermen found us very quickly. Almost as if they were supposed to.  
BORUSA: They are highly skilled in such things.  
DOCTOR 5: Especially when helped. This is the one thing the Master would be
sure to keep on him at all times. The recall device. And within.  
(The Doctor takes the top off to reveal a flashing light.)  
DOCTOR 5: A homing beacon.  
(He throws it to the Castellan.)  
BORUSA: Which you gave him, Castellan.  
CASTELLAN: It's a lie. The Doctor wants revenge.  
BORUSA: Sit down.  
CASTELLAN: I will not submit to such wild accusations.  
BORUSA: Commander!  
(The Guard Commander enters.)  
COMMANDER: Lord President?  
BORUSA: Institute an immediate and rigorous search of the Castellan's office
and living quarters.

**[Death Zone section 5]**

LEADER: I do not believe your lies.  
MASTER: What I have said is the truth. We've all been sent here for the same
reason.  
CYBERMAN 2: To fight?  
MASTER: To destroy each other for the amusement of the Time Lords. But you
don't have to play their game. You can defeat them, gain your revenge, but
only with my help.  
LEADER: Explain.  
MASTER: Close by there's a Tower, the fortress of your enemies the Time Lords.
It's well defended, but I can help you break in.  
CYBERMAN 2: And, what do you ask in return?  
MASTER: My life. My freedom. A chance to share in your revenge. To destroy the
Time Lords.  
LEADER: Guard him.  
CYBERMAN: Leader.  
(The Cyber Leader and his Lieutenant move away to confer.)  
LEADER: We will allow him to guide us to this Tower.  
CYBERMAN 2: He is an alien. Aliens are not to be trusted.  
LEADER: It is not necessary to trust him.  
CYBERMAN 2: Will you give him his freedom?  
LEADER: Promises to aliens have no validity. When the Tower is in our hands,
he will be destroyed.  
(They return to the Master.)  
LEADER: You will guide us to this Tower.

**[Tardis]**

SUSAN: They're moving so slowly.  
TURLOUGH: Don't worry. Tegan will look after the old man.  
SUSAN: If only we could make contact with the other Doctors.  
(Something thumps the Tardis.)  
SUSAN: What's that?  
(Turlough turns on the scanner.)  
TURLOUGH: Oh, no.  
SUSAN: Cybermen.

**[Dark Tower lower entrance]**

(The Second Doctor leads the way through the tunnels.)  
DOCTOR 2: Come along, Brigadier, come along. This way.  
BRIGADIER: Damn it, Doctor, I'm just not built for this kind of thing any
more.  
DOCTOR 2: You never were. Cheer up, we're getting along very nicely.  
BRIGADIER: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: 2: We should be at the Tower very soon. The tunnel's rising all the
time.  
BRIGADIER: Is that supposed to cheer me up?  
(Something roars nearby.)  
BRIGADIER: What was that?  
DOCTOR 2: It sounded like something very large and very fierce, and probably
very hungry. Come on.

**[Death Zone section 3]**

(The Third Doctor and Sarah Jane come to a slate cliff.)  
SARAH: It's a dead end.  
DOCTOR 3: No, it's not. Look.  
(He points up to a ledge.)  
SARAH: I can't go along there. I get vertigo.  
DOCTOR 3: Yes, well, I'll help you. Anyway, we can't go back.  
SARAH: Why not? You've shaken the Cybermen off.  
DOCTOR 3: They don't get tired, that's why not. And they never give up.  
SARAH: Oh, no, no. I remember. Okay, well, let's go then. And if I don't fall
off that path, I'll probably die of fright.  
(Sarah stalks off and something goes Zing!)  
DOCTOR 3: Wait!  
SARAH: What? What is it?  
(A silver android is crouching in front of a cave entrance.)  
DOCTOR 3: Look. A Raston Warrior robot. The most perfect killing machine ever
devised.  
SARAH: It isn't armed.  
(The Robot fires a javelin from its arm right between their feet.)  
DOCTOR 3: Quick, over there.  
(They take cover behind an outcrop.)  
DOCTOR 3: Their armaments are built in, and sensors detect movement. Any
movement.  
SARAH: Anything else I shouldn't know?  
DOCTOR 3: Yes. They move like lightning. (The Robot leaps and vanishes from
sight. They stand up and it lands nearby then jumps back to the cave
entrance.)  
SARAH: What's it doing?  
DOCTOR 3: Playing with us.  
(The Robot jumps again.)  
DOCTOR: 3: Right, come on.  
(They make it to another boulder, then the Robot arrives. Meanwhile, Cybermen
are making their way through the area.)  
DOCTOR 3: Freeze, Sarah Jane. If you move, we're dead.

**[Tardis]**

(The Tardis is being shaken.)  
TURLOUGH: If only we could get away from here. Can you operate the controls?  
SUSAN: Yes, but we're still trapped by the forcefield from the Tower.

**[Death Zone section 5]**

(Tegan leads the First Doctor across the heath.)  
TEGAN: Come on, Doc. You can make it.  
DOCTOR 1: Well, of course I can, young woman. And kindly refrain from
addressing me as Doc.

**[Conference room]**

[The Guard Commander has brought a casket, and places it on the table.)  
COMMANDER: As you can see, Lord President, the casket bears the Seal of
Rassilon.  
BORUSA: Where was this found?  
COMMANDER: In the Castellan's room.  
(Borusa raises the casket' lid to reveal scrolls inside.)  
FLAVIA: Black Scrolls of Rassilon!  
DOCTOR 5: Interesting. I thought they were out of print.  
BORUSA: Don't touch, Doctor. This is forbidden knowledge from the Dark Tower.  
(The scrolls burst into flames so Borusa closes the casket.)  
BORUSA: You were taking no chances.  
CASTELLAN: I am innocent. I have never seen that casket before.  
BORUSA: Take him to Security and discover the truth. Commander, you are
authorised to use the mind probe.  
CASTELLAN: What? No, not the mind probe.  
(The guards hustle the Castellan out of the room.)  
DOCTOR 5: Let me speak to him.  
BORUSA: No, Doctor. The mind probe will give us all the answers we require.  
(There is a energy weapon shot outside, and the Castellan screams.)

**[Outside the Conference room]**

(The Castellan lies dead on the steps. The Guard Commander has his weapon
drawn.)  
DOCTOR 5: Was that really necessary?  
COMMANDER: Well, as you can see, he was armed and trying to escape.  
DOCTOR 5: It seems you have been saved the embarrassment of a trial.  
BORUSA: And you have found your traitor, Doctor. Let us at least hope it will
simplify the task of your other selves.  
DOCTOR 5: Yes. Yes, I, I should be getting back to them.

**[Conference room]**

BORUSA: Doctor, I admire your courage, but I cannot allow you to return. It
will take some time to establish the Castellan's role in this affair. I need
your help and advice.  
DOCTOR 5: I can't abandon them.  
BORUSA: Oh, I'm sure your other selves will be able to cope.  
DOCTOR 5: Are they all in the Zone?  
BORUSA: Yes, all but one, and he is trapped in the Vortex. Doctor, I'm sorry,
but I must insist that you remain. Chancellor Flavia, would you escort the
Doctor to a place of rest? I'm sure he must be exhausted.

**[Dark Tower lower entrance]**

(The Second Doctor and the Brigadier reach an underground stream.)  
BRIGADIER: Whatever that creature is, it's got our scent. It's hunting us.  
(It is a man-sized furry biped. The Second Doctor finds a small gap in the
tunnel wall.)  
DOCTOR 2: Oh! In here. Oh, oh!  
(They squeeze through. The owner of the clawed hand is too big, and tries to
grab at them in vain.)  
BRIGADIER: Doctor, look!  
(The Second Doctor drives it back with the flaming torch.)  
BRIGADIER: Trapped.  
DOCTOR 2: Hold this. Must be something.  
(The Second Doctor goes through his pockets, dropping a catapult and an
apple.)  
BRIGADIER: Hurry up, Doctor. It's trying to dig us out!  
(The Doctor hands a bag of jelly babies to the Brigadier.)  
DOCTOR 2: Ah!  
(The Doctor untwists the touch paper of a firework and lights it from the
torch. The Roman Candle goes off, showering sparks at the creature, who
retreats rapidly.)  
BRIGADIER: What was that?  
(The Doctor has his fingers in his ears.)  
DOCTOR 2: Pardon?  
BRIGADIER: What was that?  
DOCTOR 2: It's a Galactic Glitter.  
(Bang!)  
DOCTOR 2: It's a Yeti!  
BRIGADIER: Where did it come from?  
DOCTOR 2: It must have been left over from the Games.  
BRIGADIER: You maddened it!  
(The Yeti causes a rockfall, blocking them in.)  
DOCTOR 2: Well, at least it can't get at us.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, and now we're trapped. Buried alive.  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, I'm afraid we are. On the other hand, where there's a wind,
there's a way.  
(The Doctor takes back the torch and follows the breeze to a small stone-
framed door set in the rock face.)  
DOCTOR 2: Well, I think we've arrived.  
(The door creaks open at his touch.)  
DOCTOR 2: I don't like this at all. Someone or something wants us to go
inside. After you, Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER: No, no, after you, Doctor.

**[Tardis]**

SUSAN: At least that terrible hammering's stopped.  
TURLOUGH: Hmm. That's what's worrying me.  
SUSAN: Look!  
(On the scanner, Cybermen have brought a coil of wire and a large device to
the Tardis.)  
SUSAN: What's that they're carrying?  
TURLOUGH: I don't know, but I would think their intention is to try and break
in.

**[Outside the Robot cave]**

SARAH: Doctor, I don't think I can take much more of this.  
(A Cyberman crunches over some broken slate.)  
DOCTOR 3: Hang on, Sarah Jane, hang on. I think we've got one hope.  
(The Raston robot fires a lance straight through the Cyberman's chest unit,
then its head. Two more Cybermen appear and get dismembered, then another five
including the Cyber Leader.)  
DOCTOR 3: Now.

**[Robot cave entrance]**

(The Third Doctor and Sarah Jane run inside. A Cyberman watches them.)  
DOCTOR 3: Look what we've got, Sarah Jane. The Robot's extra arrows. At least
we'll have something to have a fight with. Wait a minute, these might come in
handy.  
(He takes the javelins and some coils of thick wire.)  
DOCTOR 3: Come on.  
(Outside, the Robot decapitates the remaining Cyberman, then jumps.)

**[Opposite the top of the Dark Tower]**

(Sarah Jane walks to the edge of the cliff and looks across.)  
SARAH: Now what do we do, fly?  
DOCTOR 3: What a splendid idea.

**[Citadel]**

(The Fifth Doctor and Chancellor Flavia walk up and down steps by a water
feature.)  
FLAVIA: You look so worried, Doctor. Your friends and your other selves will
be safe, I am sure.  
DOCTOR 5: At the moment I'm more concerned for the High Council. For
Gallifrey.  
FLAVIA: The traitor has been found.  
DOCTOR 5: Has he? You know, I've known the Castellan too long. Oh, he was
limited, a little narrow, but always fiercely loyal to his oath of office. Any
mention of the Dark days filled him with horror. Now, you saw his reaction to
the Black Scrolls. It wasn't that of a man discovered, but of sheer disbelief.
No, I'm convinced the traitor is still at large.  
FLAVIA: I will speak to the Commander who killed the Castellan. There may be
much to be learned from him.  
DOCTOR 5: Thank you. And I must speak to the Lord President.

**[Opposite the top of the Dark Tower]**

SARAH: Doctor, Cybermen.  
DOCTOR 3: Yes, well, see if you can hold them off. I won't be a second.  
SARAH: Yeah, right.  
(The Doctor finishes fastening one wire around a boulder. Sarah throws a rock
down the slope at the Cybermen.)  
SARAH: Doctor? Missed.  
DOCTOR 3: Right, that should do it.  
SARAH: You're crazy. That'll never work.  
DOCTOR 3: Well, maybe not. Can you think of a better suggestion? No? All right
then, stand well back.  
(The Third Doctor has tied the other end of the wire into a lasso, and throws
it across the gap to a pinnacle on the Dark Tower.  
(Down below, the Master watches.)  
MASTER: Ever resourceful, Doctor.  
(The Third Doctor and Sarah Jane use small loops of wire to hold on to as they
slide down the wire to the Tower.)

**[Dark Tower - top]**

DOCTOR 3: I've got you. Now, find a foot hold. Find any foot hold.  
SARAH: Yes, yes.  
DOCTOR 3: Have you got one?  
SARAH: Yes.  
DOCTOR 3: Right. Now, let go this hand  
SARAH: I can't.  
DOCTOR 3: Hold both loops in one hand. Both loops in one hand. I've got the
other one. Right, come on. That's it. Now, find another foot hold. I've got
you. Put it on that ledge. Can you find that ledge?  
SARAH: Yes, yes.  
DOCTOR 3: Good. All right, up you come. Up you come.  
(Before he can pull her over the parapet, Sarah looks down and screams.)  
DOCTOR 3: Don't look down!  
SARAH: I'm not looking, I'm not looking.  
DOCTOR 3: Come on. Up. That's it.  
SARAH: I did it! I did it!  
DOCTOR 3: Come on. There you are. That's it.  
(Sarah is safely on the Tower.)  
DOCTOR 3: Well done. Enjoy the flight?  
SARAH: Oh, great! Well, we're here. How do you reckon we get in?  
(The Third Doctor opens a small door set at an angle.)  
DOCTOR 3: Through here, would you believe?

**[Dark Tower main entrance]**

(Tegan and the First Doctor are in front of a very large door. There is a lot
of thunder and lightning going on.)  
TEGAN: Now what? You're not suggesting we bang down the door, I hope.  
DOCTOR 1: It looks very much like a bell to me.  
(The Doctor tips open a bell on a pole to reveal a number pad. He taps
something in and the door slides up slowly.)  
TEGAN: It's an entry coder.

**[Tardis]**

(The Cybermen outside are attaching cables to a big black box.)  
SUSAN: It's a bomb.  
TURLOUGH: Big, isn't it?

**[Dark Tower - chequered corridor]**

DOCTOR 1: Don't be in such a hurry.  
(He takes out some coins.)  
TEGAN: We have to pay to get in?  
DOCTOR 1: It could cost you your life.  
(He throws a square coin onto one of the red and white alternate floor tiles,
then another, a third and a fourth.)  
TEGAN: How long do you plan to play pitch and toss?  
DOCTOR 1: Patience, child.  
(A fifth coin on a red tile sets lightning playing all across the board.)  
DOCTOR 1: Diabolical ingenuity! Nothing happens until you reach the fifth row,
half way, and then the entire board becomes a death trap.  
MASTER: Our ancestors had such a wonderful sense of humour.  
DOCTOR 1: Do I know you, young man?  
MASTER: Believe it or not, we were at the Academy together.  
TEGAN: What do you want?  
MASTER: To help.  
TEGAN: That's the funniest thing I've heard all day.  
MASTER: Believe what you like, I should advise you to hide. I've got very
suspicious allies close behind me.  
TEGAN: Allies?  
(The Cybermen come round the corner.)  
TEGAN: Come on!  
(She drags the First Doctor out of sight.)  
MASTER: Enter, but be careful. The fortress of the Time Lords is at your
mercy.  
CYBERMAN: Why was the main gate left unguarded?  
MASTER: Oh, the Time Lords believe that no one could survive the Death Zone.
It's that sort of woolly thinking that'll bring about their destruction.  
(The Cyber Leader stops at the chequered tiles.)  
MASTER: Do you fear an empty room? Shall I lead the way?  
(The Master walks to the sixth row.)  
LEADER: You will cross to the far side.  
MASTER: Very well.  
(And does so. Nothing happens. The First Doctor and Tegan look at each other,
puzzled.)  
MASTER: You see?  
(The Master returns down the right hand side.)  
LEADER: Take the patrol across.  
(The Cyber Leader stands by the Master as the Cybermen start to cross,
carefully. They all get zapped to death. One manages to crawls back so the
Master can take his weapon.)  
LEADER: You have betrayed us. Why?  
MASTER: Betrayed? No. Oh, I, I might have misled you a little, but the safe
path across the board changes with every journey.  
LEADER: You show me the safe route, or I shall destroy you.  
(The Master bows, and steps white, red, white like a chess knight moves. The
Cyber Leader starts to follow and the Master turns and fires on him. The
Master laughs as Tegan and the First Doctor come out of hiding.)  
TEGAN: Wasn't that a little ruthless even for you?  
MASTER: In one of the many wars on your miserable little planet, they used to
drive sheep across minefields. The principle's the same.  
TEGAN: Not quite. This minefield is still just as dangerous.  
MASTER: Do you think so?  
(The Master does his zigzag steps to the other side.)  
MASTER: Try it, Doctor, it's as easy as pie.  
(The Master leaves.)  
DOCTOR 1: What an extraordinary fellow. As easy as pie? As easy as pie?  
TEGAN: That's what he said.  
DOCTOR 1: No, he didn't! He said easy as pi. The Greek letter pi. Surely you
know some basic mathematics, child?  
TEGAN: Of course. The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter
is represented by the Greek letter pi, right?  
DOCTOR 1: Exactly. You find the safe path by using the mathematical formula
pi. Oh, but the application, the application. Now, let me see, now. Three
point one four one five nine two six five. Yes, that's it! You stay there,
child.  
(The Doctor crosses the board.)  
DOCTOR 1: Now!  
(The Doctor uses his cane to point out where Tegan should step.)  
TEGAN: I hope you've got your sums right.

**[Conference room]**

(The Fifth Doctor enters.)  
DOCTOR 5: President Borusa, I. I thought you said the Lord President was in
here.  
GUARD: He is. Or at least he was.  
DOCTOR 5: You're sure about that, are you?  
GUARD: Positive. There isn't any way he could have left without my seeing him.  
(The Doctor checks the transmat cubicle.)  
DOCTOR 5: No power. He couldn't have left that way. Inform Chancellor Flavia
that the Lord President has disappeared, would you?  
GUARD: Sir.  
(The guard leaves. The Fifth Doctor starts looking for hidden panels in the
walls.)

**[Dark Tower staircase]**

(The Third Doctor and Sarah Jane are walking down.)  
SARAH: I can't go on. I feel as if something were pushing me back.  
DOCTOR 3: Yes. Yes, I can feel it too, Sarah. It's the mind of Rassilon. We
must be nearing the tomb. Now, you've got to fight it. You must keep your mind
under control.  
SARAH: I can't. I feel as if something absolutely terrible were going to
happen.  
DOCTOR 3: Sit down here. Sit down. Rest for a moment. All right?  
SARAH: Where are you going?  
DOCTOR 3: I won't be a second.  
SARAH: Well, don't be too long.

**[Dark Tower corridor]**

(The Third Doctor walks along to a corner, then turns to go back to Sarah. A
man in army uniform walks round the corner.)  
YATES: Doctor. Doctor, this way.  
DOCTOR 3: Mike? Mike Yates? How did you get here?  
YATES: Same way as you. Liz Shaw is here, too.  
DOCTOR 3: Good heavens.  
(Liz comes round the corner.)  
DOCTOR 3: Hello, Liz. Any more of you?  
LIZ: Someone you should know very well. Come and see for yourself.  
DOCTOR 3: Huh, not that little fellow in the checked trousers and the black
frock coat.  
LIZ: And more. There are five of you now.  
DOCTOR 3: Oh, good grief.  
YATES: And they're waiting for you.  
DOCTOR 3: Yes, well, you wait here for a moment. I'll go and get Sarah.  
(Yates blocks his way.)  
YATES: I'll fetch her.  
DOCTOR 3: No, I, er, I think I'll go, Mike. She's nervous enough as it is.  
LIZ: Let Mike go. Your other selves need you urgently.  
DOCTOR 3: No, I think I'll go, thanks.  
(The Doctor dodges round Yates.  
YATES: No, Doctor!  
LIZ: Stop him!  
DOCTOR 3: How? You're phantoms, illusions of the mind!  
LIZ: Stop him!!!  
(Liz and Yates disappear in a cloud of black smoke.)

**[Dark Tower staircase]**

SARAH: What's happening? Doctor? Doctor! Oh, there you are.  
DOCTOR 3: Sarah?  
SARAH: Sarah? Of course I am. What are you talking about? Listen, why did you
leave me for so long? And what was that scream?  
DOCTOR 3: They were just phantoms from the past.  
SARAH: Yes, well, I'm in the present and I'm real.  
DOCTOR 3: Yes. Yeah, you're real enough. Come on. (They head off in the other
direction.)

**[Dark Tower corridor]**

TEGAN: Do you feel weird, Doctor?  
DOCTOR 1: Full of strange fears and mysterious forebodings?  
TEGAN: That's it.  
DOCTOR 1: No, as a matter of fact, I don't. It's all illusion, child. We're
close to the domain of Rassilon, whose mind is reaching out to attack us. Just
ignore it, as I do.  
TEGAN: How?  
DOCTOR 1: Fear itself is largely an illusion. And at my age, there's little
left to fear. Hmm. No, there's nothing here to harm us.  
(The Master comes down a staircase behind them and follows.)

**[Dark Tower staircase]**

(The Second Doctor and the Brigadier are coming up some stairs.)  
BRIGADIER: I don't like it, Doctor. I feel rather unwell. Touch of nausea, I
think.  
DOCTOR: 2: What you feel is fear, Brigadier, projecting from the mind of
Rassilon.  
BRIGADIER: Fear? (A woman screams nearby.)  
WOMAN [OC]: Doctor, help me!  
DOCTOR 2: No. It may be a trap. I'll go and see. You wait here.  
BRIGADIER: Certainly not. I'm coming with you.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, very well, but don't get in the way.  
(Another scream.)

**[Dark Tower corridor]**

DOCTOR 2: Take this.  
(He gives the torch to the Brigadier. The scream is close by.)  
BRIGADIER: What was that?  
DOCTOR 2: We'll go and see.  
(The Brigadier hooks the torch on a nearby sconce and they walk up to the
corner.)  
BRIGADIER: Good grief!  
DOCTOR 2: Jamie! Zoe!  
JAMIE: Stay back, Doctor.  
DOCTOR 2: Why, what's happening?  
ZOE: Don't come any closer. There's a force field.  
DOCTOR 2: A force field? We'll soon see about that.  
JAMIE: No, don't, Doctor. If the force field is disturbed, it'll destroy us.  
ZOE: You must go back.  
BRIGADIER: Well, Doctor, what are we going to do?  
DOCTOR 2: Get them out of it.  
JAMIE: No, no, please don't, Doctor.  
ZOE: Oh, go back. Save yourselves.  
DOCTOR 2: I can't. I can't leave you there.  
ZOE: You must.  
BRIGADIER: We could find another way into the tomb area.  
DOCTOR 2: But Zoe and Jamie would still be trapped.  
JAMIE: The Brigadier's right.  
DOCTOR 2: Or would they? Just a minute. It's a matter of memory.  
ZOE: Stay away!  
DOCTOR 2: Why? I can't harm you.  
JAMIE: One step nearer and we're dead!  
DOCTOR 2: You can't kill illusions.  
(The Second Doctor steps between Jamie and Zoe. Jamie's voice echoes.)  
JAMIE: Brigadier!  
DOCTOR 2: You're not real. When you were returned to your own people, the Time
Lords erased your memory of the period you spent with me. So how do you know
who we are? Answer!  
(Zoe and Jamie scream and disappear in a cloud of black smoke.)  
BRIGADIER: They're gone.  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, yes, it's sad.

**[Dark Tower staircase]**

(They keep going upwards.)  
BRIGADIER: I still don't like it, Doctor. I don't fully understand why we're
here.  
DOCTOR 2: You want to get home?  
BRIGADIER: Of course.  
DOCTOR 2: That is why we are here. Have faith, Brigadier. Have I ever led you
astray?  
BRIGADIER: On many occasions.  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, well, this will be the exception. Come along.

**[Conference room]**

(The Fifth Doctor finishes tapping at a keypad on the conference table then
goes over to the portrait on the wall. He looks at the harp standing nearby
and reads its inscription.)  
DOCTOR 5: The Harp of Rassilon. I never knew he was musical. Borusa either for
that matter.  
(He plucks a string and there is a click behind him.)  
DOCTOR 5: Interesting. A musical key. A combination of notes. A tune.

**[Rassilon's tomb]**

(The First Doctor leads Tegan into the vast marble mausoleum and goes to a
carved obelisk nearby while Tegan walks round the massive sarcophagus with its
emblems of Time Lords on the side. There is one blank space in the four we can
see. The Third Doctor enters from the other side with Sarah.)  
DOCTOR 1: Ah, there you are at last, dear fellow. What kept you?  
DOCTOR 3: What kept me? Of all the confounded arrogance.  
DOCTOR 1: Never mind, never mind, you can tell me later. Come and take a look
at this.  
DOCTOR 3: What is it?  
(They examine the obelisk together. The girls introduce each other.)  
TEGAN: Tegan.  
SARAH: Sarah.  
DOCTOR 3: Hmm. Fascinating.  
DOCTOR 1: What happened to the little fellow?  
DOCTOR 2: The little fellow is perfectly all right, thank you very much. Of
course I'm here. You don't imagine anything you two could do could stump me,
do you? Let's have a look. What's this?  
(He pushes the other two Doctors aside.)  
TEGAN + SARAH: Brigadier?  
BRIGADIER: Good heavens. It's Miss Smith, isn't it. Miss Jovanka. Don't ask me
how we got here. It was like a cross between Guy Fawkes and Hallowe'en.  
DOCTOR 3: Lethbridge Stewart? Oh, my dear fellow. How very nice to see you
again.  
BRIGADIER: Great heavens, you as well? Though I can't exactly say it's nice to
be here. Do you know, I was enjoying  
DOCTOR 3: You'll have to excuse me, old chap. We've got a very important
inscription to translate and I think they'll get it all wrong without me.  
BRIGADIER: Typical. Absolutely typical.  
SARAH: Oh, I know, I know. Drag you through time and space without so much as
a bye or leave, then leave you out when things get interesting.  
TEGAN: My version isn't any better.  
SARAH: Which one's yours?  
DOCTOR 2: So, that's what it's all about. I never dreamed.  
DOCTOR 1: It changes nothing, absolutely nothing. We lower the forcefield, get
the young fellow back from Gallifrey and all go home. This doesn't concern us.
It mustn't.  
TEGAN: What does the inscription say?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, I'd quite like to know as well.  
SARAH: Yes, we've all been through a great deal to get here.  
DOCTOR 1: You. Tell them.  
DOCTOR 2: It's Old High Gallifreyan, the ancient language of the Time Lords.
Not many people understand it these days.  
THE DOCTORS: Fortunately, I do.  
BRIGADIER: All very interesting, I'm sure, Doctors, but what does it say?  
DOCTOR 3: That this is the Tomb of Rassilon, where Rassilon lies in eternal
sleep.  
DOCTOR 2: It also says that anyone who's got this far has passed many dangers
and shown great courage and determination. What does this bit mean?  
DOCTOR 3: To lose is to win and he who wins shall lose.  
DOCTOR 2: I know what it says. What does it mean?  
DOCTOR 1: It also promises that whoever takes the ring from Rassilon's hand
and puts it on shall get the reward he seeks.  
SARAH: What reward?  
DOCTOR 1: Immortality.  
BRIGADIER: What, live forever? Never die?  
DOCTOR 1: That is what the word means, young man.  
SARAH: But that's impossible.  
DOCTOR 3: Apparently not.  
DOCTOR 2: It seems Rassilon possesses it now, and is willing to share it with
whoever takes the ring.  
MASTER: Thank you, gentlemen, that is exactly what I needed to know. I came
here to help you. A little unwillingly, but I came. My services were scorned,
my help refused. Now I shall help myself to immortality.  
DOCTOR 1: Out of the question.  
DOCTOR 3: You're hardly a suitable candidate.  
DOCTOR 2: For anything.  
(The Master points his tissue compression eliminator at the Doctors.)  
MASTER: The decision is scarcely yours. Killing you once was never enough for
me, Doctor. How, how gratifying to do it three times over.  
BRIGADIER: Nice to see you again.  
(The Brigadier has snuck up behind the Master. He turns and takes a punch to
the chin, knocking him out.)

**[Outside the Tardis]**

(The Cybermen have got several black boxes wired up around the Tardis.)  
CYBERMAN: Leader, the bombs are ready.  
LEADER: Excellent. Prepare for detonation.  
CYBERMAN: Your orders are to move back.  
CYBERMAN 2: Lieutenant.

**[Tardis]**

(Turlough and Susan watch the Cybermen leave on the scanner.)  
TURLOUGH: Do you realise what they're up to?  
SUSAN: What are we going to do we do now?  
TURLOUGH: Die, it seems.

**[Conference room]**

(The Fifth Doctor is still plucking the harp strings.)  
DOCTOR 5: Well, if it is a tune, what could it be? A tune like, a tune like. A
tune like the one that's been under my nose all the time perhaps.  
(He sits at the harp and plays the tune painted on the portrait. The section
of the wall slides away.)

**[Secret room]**

(The Fifth Doctor looks at the pentagon with the models on it. Dressed in
black and wearing the coronet, Borusa looks up from a panel.)  
BORUSA: Welcome, Doctor.  
DOCTOR 5: Lord President.  
BORUSA: You show very little surprise. Can it be that you suspected me?  
DOCTOR 5: Not at first. Your little charade fooled me for a while.  
BORUSA: Yes, it was rather neat, wasn't it? Such a pity about the Castellan,
but then I needed someone to use for a diversion.  
DOCTOR 5: Oh, Borusa. What's happened to you?  
BORUSA: You know how long I have ruled Gallifrey, Doctor, both openly or
behind the scenes.  
DOCTOR 5: Oh, you've done great service. It was only right you should become
President.  
BORUSA: President? How long before I must retire, my work half done. If I
could continue  
DOCTOR 5: Oh, I understand. You want to be President throughout all your
remaining regenerations.  
BORUSA: Oh, you underestimate my ambition, Doctor. I shall be President
Eternal, and rule forever.  
DOCTOR 5: Immortality? Oh, that's impossible, even for a Time Lord.  
BORUSA: Rassilon achieved it. Timeless perpetual bodily regeneration. True
immortality! Rassilon lives, Doctor. He cannot die. He is immortal.

**[Rassilon's tomb]**

(Tegan and Sarah tie the Master hand and foot while the Doctors examine a
control panel on a wall.)  
DOCTOR 3: Well, I've reversed the polarity of the neutron flow, so the Tardis
should be free of the forcefield now.  
DOCTOR 2: I'll try to get through to the Capitol.  
(He presses buttons on a Transmat control panel.)

**[Outside the Tardis]**

CYBERMAN: All is prepared.  
LEADER: Excellent.  
(The Tardis begins to dematerialise.)  
LEADER: Detonate!  
(KaBOOM! The Tardis is gone.)

**[Tardis]**

SUSAN: They made it! They made it!  
TURLOUGH: Are we going to the Tower?  
SUSAN: Must be, we're on preset co-ordinates.

**[Secret room]**

BORUSA: Immortal, Doctor. Before Rassilon was bound, he left clues for his
successor, whom he knew would follow him. Oh, I have discovered much, Doctor.
This Game control room, the casket with the Scrolls, the Coronet of Rassilon.  
DOCTOR 5: But not the final secret.  
BORUSA: The secret of immortality, Doctor? It lies in the Dark Tower, in the
Tomb of Rassilon itself. There are many dangers, many traps.  
DOCTOR 5: So, you sent me to the Zone to deal with them for you.  
BORUSA: I gave you companions to help, an old enemy to fight. Well, it's a
game within a game.  
DOCTOR 5: Only you botched it, didn't you? One of my selves is trapped in a
time vortex, endangering my very existence.  
BORUSA: Oh, you need have no fear, Doctor. Your temporal stability will be
maintained. I need you to serve me.  
DOCTOR 5: Oh, I would not serve you.  
BORUSA: You have no choice, Doctor. I wear the coronet of Rassilon.  
DOCTOR 5: And very fetching it is, too.  
BORUSA: It emphasises my will and allows me to control the minds of other
people. You bow down before me, Doctor.  
(Against his will, the Fifth Doctor is pushed to his knees.)  
BORUSA: Come, Doctor.

**[Conference room]**

BORUSA: It's time to go, Doctor. My immortality awaits.

**[Rassilon's tomb]**

(The Tardis materialises in a corner. Susan and Turlough come out.)  
DOCTOR 2: Can you hear me, old fellow?

**[Conference room]**

DOCTOR 2 [on monitor]: Calling the Capitol, calling the Capitol. This is the
Doctor speaking. Well, one of them. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Doctor?
Is there anybody there? Calling the Capitol.  
DOCTOR 5: Yes, I'm here.  
DOCTOR 2 [on monitor]: Ah, there I am. I mean, there you are.

**[Rassilon's tomb]**

DOCTOR 2: We've reached the Tower. We're all safe. The barriers are down and
the Tardis is here. And I say, we've made the most extraordinary discovery.  
DOCTOR 5 [on monitor]: I know what you have discovered. Do not transmit
further. Stay where you are and touch nothing. President Borusa is arriving to
take full charge.  
DOCTOR 2: Touch nothing, indeed? Who does he think he is.  
DOCTOR 1: He didn't want us to mention the Ring of Rassilon. Natural enough.  
DOCTOR 3: Something's wrong, you know.  
DOCTOR 2: You haven't changed. Still finding menace in your own shadow.  
DOCTOR 1: I feel the same.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh. Well, we shall soon see, won't we.  
(The Fifth Doctor and Borusa arrive in a transmat cubicle on the opposite side
of the Tomb from the panel and intercom.)  
TEGAN: Doctor, are you all right?  
BORUSA: Be silent. Be silent, all of you. Do not move or speak until I give
you leave.  
(The companions stand frozen to the spot.)  
BORUSA: Gentlemen, I owe you my thanks. You have served the purpose for which
I brought you here.  
DOCTOR 3: You brought us here?  
DOCTOR 2: He's after the Ring of Rassilon. He wants immortality.  
DOCTOR 3: And you were the one who didn't sense anything was wrong.  
DOCTOR 1: He's a renegade. No better than that villain down there.  
(The Master is now awake but still lying tied up on the floor.)  
DOCTOR 2: We can't allow it, you know.  
DOCTOR 3: The Tomb was sealed for the best of reasons.  
DOCTOR 1: And as soon as we're back to our own time streams, it must be sealed
again. Permanently!  
(The Doctors try to step forward. Borusa raises his staff and they are
stopped.)  
DOCTOR 2: Doctor, we need you. Join us.  
DOCTOR 1: He can't. Some kind of mind lock. Fight it, my boy, fight it.
Concentrate. We must be one.  
(The first three Doctors concentrate, and the Fifth slowly walks over to them.
Borusa lowers his staff.)  
DOCTOR 5: You see, Borusa? Together, we're a match for you.  
BORUSA: Perhaps, but you will never overcome me.  
DOCTOR 5: We don't need to. Soon, Chancellor Flavia will be here with her
guards, or can you overcome the whole High Council?  
BORUSA: Why not? I am Lord President of Gallifrey and you are the notorious
renegades. We shall see who is believed.  
RASSILON [OC]: This is the Game of Rassilon.  
(Borusa goes over to the sarcophagus.)  
DOCTOR 1: No, wait, my boy. That was the voice of Rassilon. It's out of our
hands now.  
RASSILON [OC]: Who comes to disturb Rassilon?  
BORUSA: I am Borusa, Lord President of Gallifrey.  
(A giant head appears above the sarcophagus.)  
RASSILON: Why have you come here?  
BORUSA: I come to claim that which is promised.  
RASSILON: You seek immortality?  
BORUSA: I do.  
RASSILON: Be sure. Be very sure. Even now, it is not too late to turn back.  
BORUSA: I am sure.  
RASSILON: And these others?  
BORUSA: These are my servants.  
RASSILON: Is this so?  
DOCTOR 3: It most certainly is not.  
DOCTOR 2: Don't believe him.  
DOCTOR 5: It's nonsense.  
DOCTOR 1: Don't listen to them, Lord Rassilon. President Borusa speaks the
truth.  
RASSILON: You believe that Borusa deserves the immortality he seeks?  
DOCTOR 1: Indeed I do.  
RASSILON: He shall have it. Take the Ring.  
(Borusa reaches out and removes a large ring from Rassilon's mummified corpse
on the top of the sarcophagus.)  
RASSILON: You claim immortality, Lord Borusa. You will not turn back?  
BORUSA: Never!  
RASSILON: Then put on the Ring. Others have come to claim immortality through
the ages. It was given to them, as it shall be given to you.  
(The faces of the Time Lords on the sarcophagus come to life, eyes flickering
one way and another.)  
RASSILON: Your place is prepared, Lord President Borusa.  
(Borusa clutches his head.)  
BORUSA: No! No!  
(The Ring disappears from Borusa's finger and returns to Rassilon. Borusa
vanishes and his face appears in the black portion of the sarcophagus. His
eyes flicker briefly, then they all return to stone. The companions can move
again.)  
RASSILON: And what of you, Doctors? Do you claim immortality too?  
DOCTORS: That's very kind of you. No. No, no thank you!  
DOCTOR 5: No, my Lord. All we ask is that we be returned to our proper place
in time and space.  
RASSILON: It shall be done.  
DOCTOR 5: One of us is trapped.  
RASSILON: I know. He too shall be freed.  
(The Fourth Doctor and Romana return to their punt.)  
RASSILON: So shall the one who is bound. His sins will find their punishment
in due time.  
(The Master disappears.)  
RASSILON: It is time for your other selves to depart. Let them make their
farewells and go. You have chosen wisely, Doctor. Farewell.  
(Rassilon vanishes. The First Doctor chuckles.)  
DOCTOR 5: Did you know what would happen?  
DOCTOR 1: Hmm? Oh, I'm so sorry. I suddenly realised what the old proverb
meant. To lose is to win and he who wins shall lose. It was all part of
Rassilon's trap to find out who wanted immortality and put him out of the way.
He knew very well that immortality was a curse, not a blessing.  
DOCTOR 5: Well, now it seems we must part, just as I was getting to know me.  
DOCTOR 2: So, you're the latest model, hmm?  
DOCTOR 5: Yes, and the most agreeable.  
DOCTOR 2: Certainly the most impudent.  
DOCTOR 3: And our dress sense hasn't improved much, has it?  
DOCTOR 1: Neither our manners. Well, goodbye, my boy. You did quite well,
quite well. It's reassuring to know that my future is in safe hands. Come
along, Susan.  
SUSAN: Goodbye, everybody.  
ALL: Goodbye.  
DOCTOR 2: Time to go, Brigadier. Well, goodbye.  
DOCTOR 5: Goodbye.  
(The First Doctor and Susan enter the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR 2: Goodbye, fancy pants.  
DOCTOR 3: Scarecrow.  
BRIGADIER: Doctor, don't you want your coat?  
DOCTOR 2: Bring it along, would you, Brigadier?  
(The Second Doctor enters the Tardis.)  
BRIGADIER: Certainly. Goodbye, Doctor.  
DOCTOR 5: Goodbye.  
BRIGADIER: Doctors.  
DOCTOR 3: Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER: Splendid fellows, all of you.  
(The Brigadier enters the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR 3: Well, goodbye, my dear chap. I must say, I've had the time of my
lives. Haven't we, Sarah Jane?  
SARAH: Have we? Well, I only have one life and I think I've had too much
already. Goodbye. Er, yes, it was really nice meeting you.  
DOCTOR 3: Thank you, Sarah Jane, it was nice meeting you, too.  
SARAH: What?  
DOCTOR 3: I'll explain later.  
SARAH: Oh. Fine.  
(The Third Doctor and Sarah Jane enter the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR 5: I'm definitely not the man I was, thank goodness.  
TEGAN: Are we all going home together?  
DOCTOR 5: Watch.  
(The Time Scoop takes the various incarnations of the Doctor away from the
Tardis, with their companions.)  
DOCTOR 5: Temporal fission. Old Rassilon is very clever.  
(Chancellor Flavia transmats in with two guards, in full regalia. They are
followed by two more guards.)  
FLAVIA: You are safe, Doctor. I feared President Borusa had. Where is
President Borusa?  
DOCTOR 5: Unavailable. It seems the legend about Rassilon is true.  
FLAVIA: You must make a full statement to the High Council.  
DOCTOR: Oh, must I?  
FLAVIA: It can form part of your inaugural address.  
DOCTOR 5: My what?  
FLAVIA: Doctor, you have evaded your responsibilities for far too long. The
disqualification of President Borusa leaves a gap at the very summit of the
Time Lord hierarchy. There is only one who can take this place. Yet again, it
is my duty and my pleasure to inform you that the full Council has exercised
its emergency powers to appoint you to the position of President, to take
office immediately.  
DOCTOR 5: Oh, no.  
FLAVIA: This is a summons no Time Lord dare refuse. To disobey the will of the
High Council will attract the severest penalties.  
DOCTOR 5: Very well, Chancellor Flavia. You will return to Gallifrey
immediately and summon the High Council. You have full deputy powers until I
return. I shall travel in my Tardis.  
FLAVIA: Oh, but Doctor  
DOCTOR 5: You will address me by my proper title. I am President, am I not?
You will obey my commands. (to Tegan and Turlough) Into the Tardis. (to the
guards) You will escort Chancellor Flavia back to her duties.  
(The Fifth Doctor runs for the Tardis.)  
FLAVIA: Doctor, wait!

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR 5: Hold tight.  
(The Tardis dematerialises.)  
TEGAN: It'll soon be goodbye, then.  
DOCTOR 5: Will it?  
TURLOUGH: Well, you're off to Gallifrey to be President. I suppose your Time
Lord subjects will find a Tardis that really works and get us both home?  
DOCTOR 5: Who said anything about Gallifrey?  
TURLOUGH: You told Chancellor Flavia  
DOCTOR 5: I told her she had full deputy powers until I returned.  
TEGAN: You're not going back?  
DOCTOR 5: You know, sometimes, Tegan, you take my breath away.  
TURLOUGH: Er, won't the Time Lords be very angry?  
DOCTOR 5: Furious.  
TEGAN: You mean you're deliberately choosing to go on the run from your own
people in a rackety old Tardis?  
DOCTOR 5: Why not? After all, that's how it all started.
