__**Part One**__

**[Tardis]**

(A chess match is underway. A hand moves a white bishop to Kings Rook 3.)  
TURLOUGH: Check. I said, check.  
TEGAN: I heard you.  
(Tegan is leaning on the console while the Doctor does some work underneath.
The lights are dimmed.)  
TURLOUGH: Come on, then.  
TEGAN: In a minute.  
DOCTOR: Ah!  
TEGAN: What?  
DOCTOR: Interesting. It isn't a leak.  
TEGAN: It must be. We're losing power all the time.  
DOCTOR: No, our power's being tapped somehow.  
TEGAN: Tapped? What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: It's just draining away. I don't understand.  
TURLOUGH: He never does. I'm sure it's something quite simple.  
TEGAN: You're being very calm about it.  
TURLOUGH: Your move.  
WHITE GUARDIAN [OC]: Move. Move. Move.  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, did you say something?  
TURLOUGH: No. Just that it was Tegan's move.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, er, we'll block the outlet there. For a while we'll just
have to run on reduced power.  
WHITE GUARDIAN [OC]: Power. Power. Power.  
TEGAN: What's the matter?  
DOCTOR: Quiet. I'm trying to listen to something.  
TEGAN: To what?  
DOCTOR: I'm not quite sure. It must have been my imagination.  
(The light flickers then gets darker.)  
TURLOUGH: There is something going on.  
DOCTOR: That's it! Of course, a message. Turn up the power.  
TEGAN: Turn it up? We're supposed to be conserving it.  
DOCTOR: Power.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Here. Here. Here.  
DOCTOR: We must increase energy output. Now, push that lever to full.  
TEGAN: Are you sure everything's all right?  
DOCTOR: Of course. Now, keep it at full, whatever happens.  
TEGAN: If we keep it at full, we'll lose power completely.  
(The Doctor runs into the interior.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Can you hear me?  
TEGAN: I suppose the Doctor must know what he's doing.  
DOCTOR [OC]: We're giving you more power.  
TURLOUGH: You think so? He's out there talking to himself.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Where are you?

**[Tardis corridor]**

DOCTOR: We're giving you everything we've got. It is you, isn't it?  
(A figure wearing a white chicken on his head starts to appear. He is trying
to speak.)  
DOCTOR: I can't hear you.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Power. At risk. There is extreme danger. I repeat  
(The White Guardian fades away.)  
WHITE GUARDIAN [OC]: Danger. Danger. Danger.  
DOCTOR: Keep it going!

**[Tardis]**

TURLOUGH: He's gone mad. What does he think he's doing?  
(Smoke is pouring from the time rotor.)  
TURLOUGH: We're going to blow!

**[Tardis corridor]**

DOCTOR: Go on.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Galactic north six degrees nine zero  
TEGAN [OC]: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Quiet! Keep back. Stay in the console room. Nine zero.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Seven, seven. Go immediately. Not allow.  
DOCTOR: What? Not allow what?  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Death. Death. Death.  
BLACK GUARDIAN: You cannot succeed. I control the game, the Doctor's destiny.
And soon, he will be dead. Bwahahahahaha!  
(Both Guardians vanish and the lights come back on full.)

**[Tardis]**

TEGAN: What have you done? You've reduced the power!  
(The Doctor runs in.)  
TURLOUGH: We were about to blow up!  
DOCTOR: Never, ever, disobey my instructions again.  
TURLOUGH: I thought we were going to be killed.  
DOCTOR: And because of you, many others might die.  
TEGAN: Who were you talking to?  
DOCTOR: The White Guardian.  
TEGAN: The White Guardian? Who's he?  
DOCTOR: I've no time to explain. I have to sort out these coordinates.  
TEGAN: Where are we going?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. I lost contact before I could get more information.  
TEGAN: Well, what are we supposed to do when we get there?  
DOCTOR: Prevent something happening, something dangerous.  
TEGAN: What? You don't know that, either.  
DOCTOR: No, but when the White Guardian says there's danger, he's invariably
right.  
(The Tardis lurches, sending the chess board and everyone flying.)  
TEGAN: Now what's happening?  
DOCTOR: Time override. Locking must have been in the coordinates. We're here.  
(The scanner shows blackness.)  
TURLOUGH: The air is breathable.  
TEGAN: Are you going out there?  
DOCTOR: Well, I have to find out what's going on. Turlough, get a couple of
torches.  
TEGAN: Make it three. I'm coming with you.  
DOCTOR: No. I need you here.  
TEGAN: Why does it have to be me?  
DOCTOR: The White Guardian may try and make contact again.  
TURLOUGH: Er, I'll stay, if you like.  
DOCTOR: No, I need someone I can rely on. It's important.  
TEGAN: Someone who doesn't run away.  
TURLOUGH: I explained what happened on Terminus.  
DOCTOR: Save the arguing until later.  
TEGAN: What do I have to do?  
DOCTOR: Operate this lever. His power's badly depleted. He's having to draw on
ours to get through at all.  
TEGAN: The power drain is the White Guardian?  
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly.  
TEGAN: Well, what did he say?  
DOCTOR: Well, apart from the coordinates, I could understand very little.  
TEGAN: Well, shouldn't you wait? He might try to make contact again.  
DOCTOR: No, there may not be time.  
TEGAN: But anything could be out there.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and going out is the only way to learn what it is.  
(Turlough hands the Doctor a chunky torch.)  
DOCTOR: Are you ready?  
TEGAN: Well, what if the White Guardian tells me something important?  
DOCTOR: Thank him politely. Won't be long.  
TEGAN: Good luck.

**[Yacht hold]**

(There are sounds of creaking timbers, and possibly water.)  
TURLOUGH: Wood. We're in a building.  
(Eek.)  
DOCTOR: Listen. Rats.  
(They find a couple of trunks with Striker painted on them.)  
TURLOUGH: A warehouse? Do you feel that? Can't you feel it? The ground's
moving.  
DOCTOR: I don't think so. Look at this.  
TURLOUGH: A piece of rope.  
DOCTOR: Really? Look again.  
TURLOUGH: Tar.  
DOCTOR: We're on a ship. A sailing ship. The hold, probably.  
TURLOUGH: I thought there was supposed to be great danger?  
DOCTOR: I didn't know you were so keen to find it. Down.  
(A figure enters carrying an oil lamp, moves around then leaves again.)  
TURLOUGH: What was all that about?  
DOCTOR: Checking the stores.  
TURLOUGH: Did you see the expression on his face?  
DOCTOR: Yes, almost as though he were hypnotised. Still, at least he didn't
find the Tardis. Come on.

**[Tardis]**

(Tegan is gathering up the scattered chess pieces. Behind her back, a pair of
hands reach up on the scanner, and the lights start to dim again.)  
TEGAN: White Guardian.  
(She goes to the power lever.)  
WHITE GUARDIAN: More. More. More.  
(The face of a man in Edwardian naval dress appears on the scanner.  
(The Doctor and Turlough go up a staircase from the hold and put the torches
on a shelf before opening a door.)  
TEGAN: Come on, where are you?  
WHITE GUARDIAN: You. You. You.  
TEGAN: Please hurry. Your demand for energy is causing an overload. Quickly,
the message.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Must not win. Tell the Doctor. Winner takes all. All. All.  
(The console starts a series of explosions. Tegan sees the face on the
scanner.)  
TEGAN: Who are you? The White Guardian?  
(The face smiles.)  
TEGAN: Who are you?  
(The face suddenly falls backwards with a cry.)  
TEGAN: Oh, no.

**[Yacht companionway]**

TURLOUGH: Dead end?  
DOCTOR: No, it's a door.  
(There are sounds of voices beyond it.)  
DOCTOR: You ready?

**[Yacht fo'c'sle]**

(A group of jolly tars are playing cards in the forecastle of the yacht.)  
DOCTOR: How do you do?

**[Yacht hold]**

TEGAN: Where are you? Are you hurt?

**[Yacht fo'c'sle]**

(The Doctor checks the bunks and takes a newspaper from one of them.)  
DOCTOR: Not bad.  
TURLOUGH: Are you insane? Let's get out of here.  
DOCTOR: Gently, Turlough. This one will do for me, you can take that one.  
TURLOUGH: What do you think you're doing?  
DOCTOR: Behaving as if we've just joined the crew. Edwardian England.  
TURLOUGH: Oh, no, we're on Earth again.  
DOCTOR: So it seems.  
(The newspaper is dated September 7, 1902)  
DOCTOR: First British submarine launched.  
TURLOUGH: Why don't they say something?  
DOCTOR: They're sizing us up. Fo'c'sle's fairly cramped. It's important to
know who you're sharing it with. After all, we could be cooped up here
together for months.  
TURLOUGH: You're not serious.  
DOCTOR: Only if we're both here for the trip.  
TURLOUGH: Look, shouldn't we get back to the Tardis while there's still a
chance?  
DOCTOR: No, I must find out why the White Guardian wanted me to come here.  
TURLOUGH: It was a mistake. They may be a rough lot, but they hardly threaten
the peace and harmony of the universe, do they?  
DOCTOR: We stay.

**[Yacht hold]**

(Tegan finds Striker's trunks, then hears footsteps.)  
TEGAN: Where are you?  
(She turns off her torch and hides.)

**[Yacht fo'c'sle]**

(A burly sailor comes over to the Doctor and takes the newspaper from him.)  
JACKSON: Got your bunk sorted out, have you?  
DOCTOR: Yes, thanks.  
JACKSON: Jackson's the name.  
DOCTOR: Ah. Turlough, and I'm the Doctor.  
JACKSON: Oh you are, are you? Well, it's about time. Hey, he's here, lads. The
Doctor's aboard.  
COLLIER: (amongst general cheers) Thank Gawd for that.  
DOCTOR: You've been expecting me?  
JACKSON: More than expecting you, slush, we've been waiting for you. Where you
been, eh? I mean, we've been living on nothing but hard tack since we come
aboard, haven't we, lads?  
ALL: Yeah, right.  
JACKSON: Get us some proper food, that's what we want.  
COLLIER: Yeah, none of your stinky greasy messes, either.  
ALL: Right.  
JACKSON: Not like that last cook we had, eh?  
DOCTOR: The doctor. Of course, the ship's cook.  
(Turlough finds it very amusing.)

**[Yacht hold]**

(Tegan watches a pair of legs go up the ladder, turns and finds a second pair
standing behind her. They belong to the officer she saw on the scanner.)  
TEGAN: Hello.  
MARRINER: Fascinating.  
TEGAN: What?  
MARRINER: Who are you? A stowaway?  
TEGAN: No, I can explain.  
MARRINER: Yes, you're a stowaway and I shall put you in irons.  
(Tegan turns off her torch and hides.)  
MARRINER: Where are you? Where are you?

**[Yacht fo'c'sle]**

DOCTOR: Er, may I?  
JACKSON: Yeah, yeah. I'm tired of reading it. Yeah, you can have it. It's two
days old, though.  
MAN: How's the world up top?  
DOCTOR: Have you been below decks for two days?  
JACKSON: Yeah, we've been battened under hatches since we come aboard, haven't
we lads, eh?  
ALL: Yeah.

**[Yacht hold]**

MARRINER: Where are you?  
(Tegan tries to creep away and bumps into something that makes her drop her
torch with a clatter.)

**[Yacht fo'c'sle]**

JACKSON: Here, meet the lads. Farley, Wade, Jenkins, Grogan, and that one's
Collier.  
DOCTOR: How do you do? Did you all come aboard at the same time?  
COLLIER: Dunno. Can't remember. Why'd you ask?  
DOCTOR: Curious.  
COLLIER: Truth of the matter is, we don't rightly remember. Probably drank too
much.  
DOCTOR: Celebrating your last night ashore.  
COLLIER: Yeah, but he don't drink.  
JACKSON: No, I signed a pledge. Ain't touched a drop since, but I don't
remember nothing neither.  
DOCTOR: And you're quite sure not one of you can remember coming aboard?  
COLLIER: No. It's blank. The whole thing, blank.

**[Yacht hold]**

(Tegan is blocked by a second officer.)  
MARRINER: Allow me.  
TEGAN: That isn't possible. Who are you?  
(She is escorted out of the hold.)

**[Yacht fo'c'sle]**

DOCTOR: Surely, surely you must find it rather strange that none of you can
recall signing on?  
COLLIER: Oh, we remember that all right.  
JACKSON: Oh yeah, I mean, we signed on aboard, didn't we, lads?  
COLLIER: Yeah. And we got a month's wages in advance. Not likely to forget
that, now, would we?  
JACKSON: Now that's one thing I'll say for the Captain. I mean, he certainly
ain't mean.  
COLLIER: Yeah, but he stands to make a packet, I dare say, if we win.  
JACKSON: And we will.  
TURLOUGH: Win what?  
JACKSON: The race, lad. The race.

**[Yacht companionway]**

MARRINER: Why are you frightened?  
TEGAN: Isn't it obvious?  
MARRINER: I'm not going to hurt you. I want to please you. Would you like me
to find your friends for you?  
TEGAN: What friends?  
MARRINER: The two you're looking for.  
TEGAN: Where are they? What have you done with them?  
MARRINER: Nothing. I haven't met them yet. I could take you to them, if that's
what you'd like.  
TEGAN: Yes, that's what I'd like.  
MARRINER: This way. Please? You won't try to run away again, will you? Please?
You see, I find you fascinating. Quite fascinating.

**[Yacht fo'c'sle]**

COLLIER: Ah, that was a race, now. Regular flier she was, the old America.  
TURLOUGH: A flier?  
COLLIER: Yeah. Crossed the Atlantic in seventeen days, she did.  
TURLOUGH: Huh. Hardly a flying ship.  
COLLIER: Slim bows.  
JACKSON: No, no. You give me a ship that's bluff in the bow and narrow in the
stern.  
COLLIER: Oh, yeah. Or a woman, cod head and mackerel tail.  
JACKSON: None of your flying ships. What, you been at the bottle, have you,
lad? Little bit of Dutch courage, eh? Now that's no good for a green hand.  
GROGAN: That's right.  
JACKSON: And it's no good for us older hands either. Now, you've got to keep a
clear head if you're going up there.  
COLLIER: Yeah, and strong arms. Otherwise you're down on the deck from the
height of the crosstree, splat.  
JACKSON: Keep hold of those shrouds and make certain you get the lifeline
under your feet. You use your eyes and check that rigging before you go up
there.  
COLLIER: Here, know why a pig can never become a sailor? Cos he can't look
aloft!  
(The sailors burst into hysterical laughter then go quiet when an officer
enters.)  
JACKSON: Looks like you're wanted.  
DOCTOR: You know where the Tardis is if things get difficult.  
(The Doctor leaves. The officer stops Turlough from following.)  
TURLOUGH: Where have they taken him?  
COLLIER: Poop quarters.  
JACKSON: Yeah, the first mate will want to see him, I dare say.  
COLLIER: Maybe the Captain, even.  
JACKSON: Living like lords they are, back there. Every luxury.  
COLLIER: Yeah, while we have to make do with salt, junk and hard tack.  
TURLOUGH: He'll be all right?  
JACKSON: Who can tell?

**[Yacht stateroom]**

(Tegan is admiring the lavish dinner setting when the Doctor is brought in.
The Doctor rolls his eyes.)  
TEGAN: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: What are you doing here?  
TEGAN: Don't ask. I was so stupid.  
DOCTOR: You're unharmed? Did the White Guardian make contact again?  
TEGAN: It was very confused.  
DOCTOR: Well, tell me everything you can remember.  
TEGAN: Well, he was insistent somebody or something must not win the race.
Tell the Doctor, he said, winner takes all.  
DOCTOR: Well, is that it?  
TEGAN: The console blew up. It's not much help, is it.  
DOCTOR: Well, you did your best.  
TEGAN: The message doesn't make sense, winner takes all.  
DOCTOR: It may do, especially as we're on a racing yacht.  
TEGAN: How do you know?  
DOCTOR: We've been talking to the crew.  
TEGAN: I hope they're not as peculiar as the officers.  
(A Bo'sun's whistle sounds outside.)  
TEGAN: The one I've met's very strange.  
(The doors are opened and  Keith Barron walks in.)  
STRIKER: Welcome aboard. Delighted you could join us. Captain Striker at your
service.  
DOCTOR: How do you do? I'm the  
STRIKER: The Doctor and Miss Tegan. Allow me to present my fellow officers.  
(Two blank-faced men salute.)

**[Yacht fo'c'sle]**

JACKSON: Ah, they're a funny lot, if you ask me.  
COLLIER: The afterguard always are.  
TURLOUGH: What do you mean, a funny lot.  
JACKSON: Well, they keep themselves to themselves.  
COLLIER: Nobody's hardly set eyes on the Captain yet, not even the bo'sun.  
JACKSON: Nah, he's right. Takes most of his orders from the first mate.  
COLLIER: It was the first mate when we signed on, remember?  
TURLOUGH: Did he say where the ship's going?  
COLLIER: I don't remember.  
JACKSON: We're here for the race. I mean, that's all that matters.  
TURLOUGH: Yes, but where are we racing to? Where's the finish?  
(The ship moves.)  
JACKSON: We'll find out soon enough. There she blows. That's what we've been
waiting for. The wind's beginning to freshen.

**[Yacht stateroom]**

(The Doctor and Tegan are dining with the Captain and the two officers. A
glass of red wine falls over and breaks, staining the nice white tablecloth.
The Doctor hands his own glass over to the officer.)  
DOCTOR: Please.  
TEGAN: I hope it's not going to be too rough. I'm not a very good sailor.  
DOCTOR: Oh, brave heart, Tegan.  
TEGAN: It's not my heart I'm worried about, Doctor.  
STRIKER: There is no cause for concern, Miss Tegan. We have the perfect
antidote for mal de mer.  
TEGAN: Thank you.  
(Marriner enters and salutes his Captain.)  
MARRINER: Breaking out the rum ration, sir.  
STRIKER: Good. Well, here's to an eventful passage, gentlemen, and a stormy
one. My first mate Mister Marriner. You've met, I believe, Miss Tegan. The
Doctor. Mister Marriner is my right hand man. He deals with the crew.
Everything in order?  
MARRINER: Yes, sir. They're being prepared.  
STRIKER: Good. I must apologise for this rather abrupt end to dinner. Look out
for the lady.  
MARRINER: Sir.  
(Striker and his officers leave. Marriner offers Tegan his arm.)  
MARRINER: Allow me.  
TEGAN: Where are we going?  
MARRINER: The wheelhouse.  
TEGAN: Doctor?  
(The Doctor finishes his spoonful of dessert and goes in the opposite
direction.)

**[Yacht fo'c'sle]**

(The whistle is piping and the crew are rushing for the door.)  
COLLIER: See you later, lad.  
TURLOUGH: What's going on?  
COLLIER: That's grog ration.  
(Only Turlough and Jackson are left.)  
JACKSON: Good lad. You're taking my advice, I see.  
TURLOUGH: What do you mean?  
JACKSON: Well, keeping a clear head. Now don't you worry, I'll look after you.
Are you all right, then?  
TURLOUGH: Where to?  
JACKSON: Up aloft. Come on.  
(Jackson drags Turlough out.)

**[Yacht companionway]**

(The Doctor avoids the sailors rushing up to the deck for their alcohol
allowance.)  
JACKSON: Come on, lad.  
TURLOUGH: I'll catch you up.  
DOCTOR: You're not going with them?  
TURLOUGH: No, thanks. They're going aloft. The rigging's no place for a coward
like me.  
DOCTOR: Hmm.  
TURLOUGH: Now where?  
DOCTOR: To find Tegan, if your courage is up to it. She's on the way to the
wheelhouse. Don't ask me why she left the Tardis. Did you manage to find out
anything about the race?  
TURLOUGH: Well, the crew don't know anything. Can't we go back to the Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Yes, when we've found Tegan.  
(A man screams.)

**[Outside the yacht wheelhouse]**

TEGAN: What was that?  
MARRINER: One of the crew going aloft. It sometimes affects them that way,
especially when it's the first time.  
TEGAN: First time? You mean you send completely inexperienced crewmen aloft in
a race?  
MARRINER: They soon get used to it.  
(Tegan sees a set of shiny suits hanging on a nearby bulkhead.)  
TEGAN: Now wait a minute. Wetsuits? What are wetsuits doing on an Edwardian
sailing ship?  
MARRINER: This way.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

TEGAN: It's dark outside.  
MARRINER: Isn't it always dark?  
TEGAN: It's just that I expected it to be daylight.  
STRIKER: Mister Mate?  
MARRINER: Excuse me. Sir.  
(The Doctor and Turlough enter.)  
DOCTOR: Are you all right?  
TEGAN: Of course. Did you see what was in one of the companion ways?  
TURLOUGH: What?  
TEGAN: Underwater gear, like scuba divers wear.  
DOCTOR: Maybe this'll tell us where we are.  
(They go over to the chart desk. There is a route marked around three buoys
out and back from a start/finish line.)  
TURLOUGH: Well, it doesn't make a lot of sense.  
TEGAN: It looks like the position of marker buoys.  
DOCTOR: Oh, they're considerably more than that.  
STRIKER: Mister Mate, we will look at our competitors, please.  
MARRINER: Aye, aye, sir.  
(Marriner opens the lid of a chest and taps in codes on three pads.)  
TEGAN: Electronics. On an Edwardian racing yacht.  
(A pair of panels move aside to reveal a whole armada of sailing ships,
floating in the blackness of space.)  
DOCTOR: Look at the screen. We're not on a yacht, we're on a ship. A
spaceship.

__**Part Two**__

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

DOCTOR: Remarkable, though I think they have their maritime history slightly
confused.  
TURLOUGH: But why waste such skill? What are they trying to achieve?  
TEGAN: It's like a game.  
TURLOUGH: The crew are real enough.  
DOCTOR: Yes. What about the officers?  
TURLOUGH: Androids?  
DOCTOR: No, no, it's much more complicated than that. Tegan?  
TEGAN: I feel terrible. I think I'm seasick.  
STRIKER: Mister Mate.  
MARRINER: Sir. Allow me to escort you to your cabin.  
TEGAN: Have to hurry.  
DOCTOR: Oh, nonsense, Tegan. The ship's hardly moving.  
TEGAN: For you, maybe.  
DOCTOR: Now wait a minute.  
(An officer closes the door between the departing Marriner and Tegan, and the
Doctor.)  
TURLOUGH: She'll be all right. Whatever else is gong on here, no one's
threatened us.  
DOCTOR: Yet.

**[Yacht companionway]**

MARRINER: I've arranged somewhere for you to rest.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

STRIKER: Check our exact position. We're about to round our next planet,
gentlemen.  
TURLOUGH: Planet?  
DOCTOR: Look at the chart.  
TURLOUGH: Remarkable. These are planets.  
DOCTOR: If you look carefully enough, you'll see it's a solar system
containing Earth.  
TURLOUGH: Well, that explains where they got their crew from.  
DOCTOR: Indeed. Look, leave now. Find where Marriner's taken Tegan.  
TURLOUGH: And you?  
DOCTOR: I want to see what else I can find out here.  
STRIKER: There's no need to whisper, Doctor. You and your companions are free
to come and go as you wish. You are our guests, not our prisoners.

**[Tegan's cabin]**

TEGAN: I want to die.  
MARRINER: Drink this.  
TEGAN: What is it?  
MARRINER: A mixture.  
(Tegan sniffs the glass and recoils.)  
TEGAN: Rum?  
MARRINER: Drink it.  
TEGAN: No, thanks.  
MARRINER: It'll make you feel much better.  
TEGAN: Really? Then drink it yourself.  
MARRINER: It's quite safe.  
(Marriner takes a sip.)  
MARRINER: Drink it. It'll make you feel much better.  
(Tegan drinks.)

**[Yacht companionway]**

(Turlough comes to a flight of stairs and is about to go up when an officer
comes down and blocks his way.)  
TURLOUGH: Where does this lead?  
OFFICER: The deck. The crew are busy at the moment. You would only be in the
way up there.  
TURLOUGH: What are they doing?  
OFFICER: Hauling on the halyards.  
TURLOUGH: Halyards? On a spaceship?  
OFFICER: We observe the spirit as well as the rules of the race. You'll find
the cabin of the person you seek off the starboard side.  
TURLOUGH: Thank you.

**[Tegan's cabin]**

MARRINER: Now you must rest.  
(Marriner takes Tegan's feet and lifts them up onto the bed so she lies down.)  
MARRINER: And I must return to duty.  
TEGAN: (dozy) That was a marvellous drink.  
MARRINER: We shall be rounding the next marker buoy soon.  
TEGAN: Marker buoy.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

(A planet shrouded in shiny white clouds.)  
DOCTOR: Venus.  
STRIKER: Our first obstacle.  
DOCTOR: What are you proposing to do?  
STRIKER: You will see.  
(The screen switches to a view of a Greek trireme, rowing in vacuum whilst
under sail.)  
STRIKER: Our next major obstacle is the Greek.  
(Now we see a Greek captain sitting eating grapes.)  
STRIKER: I intend to win this race, and Critas the Greek is the only captain
who could possibly beat me.  
DOCTOR: All the period detail is impressively accurate.  
STRIKER: There is no point to the race if it isn't.  
DOCTOR: Everything except that jewel.  
(Striker zooms in on a ring on Critas' finger.)  
DOCTOR: That isn't contemporary. Seventeenth century Spanish, isn't it?  
STRIKER: You're very observant.  
DOCTOR: The only think out of period. Why?  
STRIKER: When you meet, perhaps you would like to ask him.  
(And back to the view of Venus again.)

**[Tegan's cabin]**

(Turlough enters. Marriner has left.)  
TURLOUGH: Tegan? Tegan!  
TEGAN: Hello?  
TURLOUGH: Are you all right?  
TEGAN: Of course.  
TURLOUGH: Are you sure?  
TEGAN: I feel marvellous.  
TURLOUGH: You're not space-sick any more?  
TEGAN: Not at all.  
(Turlough sniffs the remaining drink in the glass.)  
TURLOUGH: This must be what they give the crew. Well, it doesn't seem to do
them any harm.  
TEGAN: I'm pleased to hear it. What a jumble this room is.  
TURLOUGH: Although some of it seems quite familiar.  
TEGAN: It's a weird mix of my room on the Tardis and my bedroom in Brisbane.  
TURLOUGH: I'm beginning to find this ship very strange.  
(Tegan picks up a framed photograph from the bedside cabinet.)  
TEGAN: Aunt Vanessa. I don't believe it. It's as though somebody's been
rummaging around in my memories.  
TURLOUGH: Perhaps they have. Come on, let's go and find the Doctor.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

DOCTOR: Why are you doing this?  
STRIKER: The race? As a diversion.  
DOCTOR: And the crews for the ships, you collected from their different time
zones just as a diversion, too?  
STRIKER: They are Ephemerals.  
DOCTOR: Ephemerals?  
STRIKER: Beings like yourself.  
DOCTOR: You had no right to do it. They're real. Living, breathing flesh and
blood.  
STRIKER: You are not an Ephemeral. You are a time dweller. You travel in time.  
DOCTOR: You're reading my thoughts.  
STRIKER: You are a Time Lord. A lord of time. Are there lords in such a small
domain?  
DOCTOR: And where do you function?  
STRIKER: Eternity.  
SAILOR: Marker buoy, sir, coming up on the starboard bow.  
STRIKER: The endless wastes of eternity.

**[Yacht companionway]**

(A line of soldiers in 'wet suits' are receiving their rum ration before
closing their space helmets and heading up to the deck. A couple of them run
past Turlough and Tegan.)  
TEGAN: What's happening? Are those men going up into the rigging?  
TURLOUGH: They must be.  
TEGAN: But it's madness. This ship can't possibly function like a real sailing
ship.  
TURLOUGH: Never heard of solar winds?  
TEGAN: Yeah.  
TURLOUGH: Well, they exist for real and produce more than enough energy to
propel a ship like this.  
TEGAN: I don't understand it. These men are from early twentieth century
Earth. How can they accept pressurised suits without question?  
(Jackson, dressed in spacesuit, beckons to Turlough.)  
JACKSON: Turlough, come here.  
TURLOUGH: Perhaps not all of them do. Wait here.  
JACKSON: Yeah, now look, they're mad, the whole lot of them. I think it's the
demon drink.  
TURLOUGH: No.  
JACKSON: But it is, it's got to be. I mean, they've had me at it up there. I
thought I was sailing in space, going round the stars and I ain't touched a
drop. I tell you, they must be putting it in the drinking water and all. Now
look, I've got this key.  
TURLOUGH: To what?  
JACKSON: It's the key to the rum locker. Look, I've got to go, but you've got
to stand by me, lad, like I've stood by you. We've got to chuck the grog over
the side. The boys'd never go aloft without it.  
(Jackson leaves.)  
TURLOUGH: No, they wouldn't, would they.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

STRIKER: Stand by to shorten sail.  
(Marriner uses the speaking tube.)  
MARRINER: Get them aloft, bo'sun. Stand by to shorten sail.  
STRIKER: A point and a half to starboard, helmsman.  
DOCTOR: What are you doing?  
STRIKER: Hold her on course. We'll cut it as fine as we can.  
DOCTOR: Do you think that wise? We're coming in too fast.  
STRIKER: Man the topsail.  
MARRINER: Man the topsail.  
DOCTOR: Come about or you'll crash.  
STRIKER: Certainly not. Hold her on course, helmsman.  
MARRINER: Get those men aloft. Man the topsail. Stand by to lower the jib. Get
those men aloft!

**[Yacht companionway]**

(Jackson is being a nuisance at the rum line.)  
JACKSON: No, I won't. I don't want that. I don't drink. I've signed the
pledge. Look, I'm not drinking it! I'm not! No, I'm not going back up there,
either. You can't send me back. Turlough, you'd better help me. You said you
would help me.  
(The officers manhandle Jackson up the stairs to the deck.)  
JACKSON: It's in the drink! It's in the drink!  
TURLOUGH: I think it's time we weren't here. Come on, let's go and find the
Doctor.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

(Striker takes the wheel.)  
STRIKER: Hold her on course, man. What are we down to, Mister Mate?  
MARRINER: Staysail, inner jib and mainsail. If we strip her any more, she
won't steer.  
DOCTOR: Heave to.  
STRIKER: And lose our chance of being first round? Never! This is the sort of
excitement that makes eternity bearable.  
(Turlough and Tegan run in.)  
TEGAN: What's happening?  
DOCTOR: We're running before the wind.  
TEGAN: How?  
DOCTOR: It's some sort of ion drive. It comes to the same thing.  
TURLOUGH: We're going to hit!  
(Thump!)  
STRIKER: Get back to the wheel, helmsman.  
HELMSMAN: Aye, aye, sir.  
MARRINER: A close shave, Captain.  
STRIKER: They'll never catch us now.  
TURLOUGH: We must have entered the gravitational pull of the planet. Why
didn't we crash?  
DOCTOR: Well, we had a lot of luck.  
TEGAN: Luck? We could have been killed.  
MARRINER: But worth risking to win.  
STRIKER: We are determined to be first.  
DOCTOR: And winner takes all.  
MARRINER: Of course.  
STRIKER: Let us see who is next around the marker, Mister Marriner.  
MARRINER: Sir.  
STRIKER: Critas and the Buccaneer.  
MARRINER: Neck and neck.  
TEGAN: Doctor, this is madness.  
DOCTOR: We must stay with it. Remember what the White Guardian said, winner
takes all. It has to be the winner of this race.  
(The trireme gets caught in a gravitational eddy, spins around and explodes.
Charybdis wins again.)  
TEGAN: No!  
(The officers remove their caps in respect.)  
STRIKER: Gravitational pull, would you say?  
MARRINER: He cut it a bit too fine.  
STRIKER: Bad luck, really.  
TEGAN: Is that all you can say? A ship and its crew has just been destroyed.  
DOCTOR: They're not interested, Tegan.  
STRIKER: We have a clear lead, gentlemen, and I intend to keep it. Mister
Marriner, issue the crew with an extra ration of rum with the Captain's
compliments.  
MARRINER: Aye, aye, sir.  
TURLOUGH: I've never seen a ship break up like that. Was it gravitational
pull?  
DOCTOR: No.  
TEGAN: What?  
DOCTOR: You saw the way the ship was manoeuvred around Venus. These vessels
are built to withstand enormous stress.  
TEGAN: Sabotage.  
DOCTOR: Or it was shot down. It seems this race is getting serious. Someone is
prepared to kill in order to win.  
TEGAN: But what, what's the prize?  
DOCTOR: That we must find out. I think it's time we had a conference.  
TEGAN: You don't think  
DOCTOR: Not here, Tegan, your cabin. I'll meet you there in a moment.

**[Yacht companionway]**

TEGAN: What was all that about?  
TURLOUGH: You've forgotten your room? Some of them can mind-read. We've got to
be very careful.  
TEGAN: This is turning into a nightmare.  
TURLOUGH: Hmm. Come on.  
MARRINER: Allow me to escort you.  
TEGAN: No, thanks.  
(Tegan walks off, and Marriner follows her anyway.)

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

STRIKER: No one on this ship is responsible for the destruction of the Greek.  
DOCTOR: Then who did it?  
STRIKER: I don't know. Although sabotage is not against the rules of the race,
it is simply less diverting.  
DOCTOR: Oh, it spoils the fun, you mean. What is against the rules?  
STRIKER: To go beyond. We must remain within those limits we have chosen for
ourselves.  
DOCTOR: You chose this ship.  
STRIKER: Yes.  
DOCTOR: And the crew?  
STRIKER: They were selected from the relevant period of Earth history.  
DOCTOR: But why? I mean, it's not just to sail the ships, is it. No, of course
not. You need their minds, human minds.  
STRIKER: Human?  
DOCTOR: Ephemeral, then. From any planet, any galaxy, any time. The minds of
living beings. You depend on them.  
STRIKER: We are Eternals. You presume to think we depend upon the Ephemeral
mind with all our power, our technology?  
DOCTOR: And I wonder where you got it from, all your technology. Mind you, if
you can pick Earth beings from nineteenth century England, from the Athens of
Pericles, from the Ch'in dynasty, I suppose you can just as easily pick the
minds of more advanced beings from other galaxies.  
STRIKER: Correct.  
DOCTOR: Parasites! That's what Eternals are. You feed on living minds, you use
them as blueprints.  
STRIKER: As diversions.  
DOCTOR: Oh, absolutely. I do see what you mean. Living minds are contaminated
with crude emotions, organic, irrational, creative, entertaining.  
STRIKER: It is true that Ephemerals, dwellers in time, do have a certain
entertainment value.  
DOCTOR: You talk as though they were toys.  
STRIKER: To me, they are.  
DOCTOR: Then why is one of you taking this race so seriously?  
STRIKER: Where are you going?  
DOCTOR: You don't know?  
STRIKER: To Miss Tegan's cabin.  
DOCTOR: You didn't know, though, just for a second. Interesting.

**[Yacht companionway]**

(Turlough gets out the Black Guardian's crystal.)  
TURLOUGH: Can you hear? I need your help. Can you hear me?  
(Turlough ducks out of the way as sailors come down from the deck.)

**[Outside Tegan's cabin]**

TEGAN: Go away. Stop following me.  
MARRINER: Why are you angry with me?  
TEGAN: Angry? I'm not angry, I'm disgusted. A ship blows up, all aboard are
lost, and you don't even care.  
MARRINER: You don't understand. They were not lost. They transferred.  
TEGAN: They were saved?  
MARRINER: They transferred home.  
TEGAN: The whole crew? No, you don't mean the crew at all, do you. You mean
the officers. Things like you, whatever you are. What happened to the crew?
Were they all killed?  
MARRINER: But Ephemerals have such short lives in any case.  
TEGAN: Human beings, you mean.  
MARRINER: Whatever you wish to call them. And on this ship at least, they are
treated well.  
TEGAN: Well? I happen to think that human lives are just as valuable as yours.
I happen to be a human being.  
MARRINER: But you're different.  
(Tegan slams the cabin door in his face, and locks it.)  
MARRINER: You're not like any Ephemeral I've met before.

**[Yacht companionway]**

(Turlough finds another area where he hopes not to be disturbed.)  
TURLOUGH: You must answer. I need your help. What's going on here?  
BLACK GUARDIAN: You are pathetic.  
(The Black Guardian grabs Turlough by the throat.)  
BLACK GUARDIAN: I have watched your progress. You had many opportunities to
destroy the Doctor.  
TURLOUGH: I can't kill him.  
BLACK GUARDIAN: Then I condemn you to everlasting life. You will never leave
this ship.  
(The Black Guardian throws Turlough to the floor and laughs evilly as he fades
away.)

**[Tegan's cabin]**

(Tegan is sitting on the bed, looking at the photograph of Aunt Vanessa. There
is a knock on the door.)  
TEGAN: Go away.  
DOCTOR [OC]: It's me.  
(Tegan lets him in.)  
DOCTOR: What's the matter?  
TEGAN: This. This room.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, they can make anything they see in your mind. That's how
this ship was made, out of the minds of the crew. Just as this room was.  
TEGAN: Shows the state my mind's in.  
(The Doctor picks up a stuffed koala bear toy.)  
DOCTOR: Hmm.  
TEGAN: Are they like Time Lords?  
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, they exist outside of time.  
TEGAN: How?  
DOCTOR: They're eternal. They exist in eternity. It's er, it's not really what
you'd call living.  
TEGAN: So what makes them tick?  
DOCTOR: We do. Their minds are empty, used up. They need ideas from us.
They're desperate for them.  
TEGAN: We've got to get away from here.  
DOCTOR: Yes, not till I find out what's at the end of the race.  
TEGAN: I must go back to the Tardis. I can't cope with Marriner.  
DOCTOR: I do understand how you feel, but I must ask you to stay. The Tardis
is the last thing I want them to find out about.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

STRIKER: Tardis?

**[Tegan's cabin]**

TEGAN: Could they do anything to the Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't like to risk it. They do have enormous power.  
TEGAN: What do we do?  
DOCTOR: Try to distract them, give them something to worry about. Even an
Eternal can't put his mind to too many things at once. Come on.  
TEGAN: I won't be able to do that. Please, take me back to the Tardis.  
DOCTOR: All right. Where's Turlough?  
TEGAN: I don't know.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

STRIKER: Now.  
MARRINER: Aye, aye, sir.

**[Yacht companionway]**

TEGAN: I won't be happy until I'm back in that console room again.  
DOCTOR: Turlough!  
(Turlough is just starting to wake up.)  
DOCTOR: What happened?  
TURLOUGH: I fell.  
TEGAN: Are you sure? What are those marks?  
DOCTOR: Are you all right?  
TURLOUGH: I think so.  
DOCTOR: Come on. We're taking Tegan back to the Tardis.  
(Striker smiles and sips a glass of champagne.)

**[Outside the yacht hold]**

(The Doctor picks up the torches he stashed.)  
DOCTOR: Turlough, you wait here.  
TURLOUGH: Doctor, can't we all leave? They may not have harmed us, but the
atmosphere on this ship is evil.  
TEGAN: He's right.  
DOCTOR: Is he? You can both wait for me in the Tardis.

**[Yacht hold]**

DOCTOR: Over here.  
TEGAN: Where is it?  
DOCTOR: Well, it was here.  
TURLOUGH: Oh, no. It can't have just disappeared.  
DOCTOR: They've found out about the Tardis.  
OFFICER: You're right. Take the woman to Mister Marriner.  
TEGAN: No!  
OFFICER: Please, Doctor, resistance is futile. We mean her no harm.  
DOCTOR: What have you done with the Tardis?  
OFFICER: You'll find out. Lead the way.

**[Yacht companionway]**

(Marriner steps out behind Tegan and her escort, dressed in a spacesuit.)  
MARRINER: I'm sorry you wanted to leave. Please, put one on.  
TEGAN: No.  
MARRINER: There's so much I wish to show you.  
TEGAN: I'm not putting that suit on.  
MARRINER: Please. The sooner you do, the sooner you'll be reunited with your
friends.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

DOCTOR: I underestimated you.  
STRIKER: You helped me. Such was your concern, I could recall your mind as far
away as the cabin. The picture was as clear as if you were standing here.  
DOCTOR: What picture?  
STRIKER: Of your ship. The Tardis, I believe you call her. Adrenaline is a
most effective energy boost. Your own fear gave her to us.  
DOCTOR: Where have you taken  
STRIKER: Miss Tegan is quite safe. She's on deck. Thank you.  
(Their escort leaves to fetch some spacesuits.)  
STRIKER: Perhaps you would care to join her.  
TURLOUGH: No! I don't want to go up there. Look, I'll tell you what's going on
below decks with the Ephemerals. It's mutiny! I'll give you something  
STRIKER: Turlough, you have the key to the rum locker which Jackson
appropriated.  
TURLOUGH: You know about that as well.  
STRIKER: Naturally. Thank you.  
(Turlough takes the spacesuit.)  
TURLOUGH: There's no need to look at me like that. They knew about it, you
heard, so I didn't give him away.  
DOCTOR: Will Jackson be punished?  
STRIKER: For entertaining us? Superior beings do not punish inferiors.  
DOCTOR: Superior?  
STRIKER: We use them kindly. Jackson is quite calm again. He realises he is
safe, as you will. The suit's merely a precaution.

**[Yacht deck]**

(Marriner leads Tegan out.)  
TEGAN: Why have you brought me here?  
MARRINER: Isn't the sight beautiful? I can see in your mind you find it so.  
TEGAN: Where's the Doctor?  
MARRINER: He will be with us in a moment.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

STRIKER: On deck, you will have an interesting view of our competitors. It may
help you to decide which one is the saboteur.  
DOCTOR: What are you competing for? I mean, the whole point of a race is to
win something. What's the prize?  
STRIKER: Enlightenment.  
DOCTOR: Enlightenment.  
STRIKER: The wisdom which knows all things and which will enable me to achieve
what I desire most. Do not ask what it is. I will not tell you.

**[Yacht deck]**

(Marriner opens his helmet.)  
MARRINER: It's perfectly all right. You may also remove your helmet. The
atmosphere is breathable. It's maintained by an invisible energy barrier.  
(Marriner opens Tegan's helmet.)  
TEGAN: You like giving people shocks, don't you.  
MARRINER: I wanted to show you I was telling the truth. Now you can trust me.  
(The Doctor and Turlough come on deck.)  
TURLOUGH: Will we ever get off this ship?  
DOCTOR: Once we've found the Tardis.  
BLACK GUARDIAN [OC]: You are doomed, boy. You are doomed, boy. You are doomed,
boy.  
TURLOUGH: Are you sure, Doctor? We will get off?  
DOCTOR: Hopefully, Turlough, hopefully.  
BLACK GUARDIAN [OC]: You have failed me. You will now see my wrath. Now see my
wrath. Now see my wrath. You will live aboard this ship in perpetual torment.  
TURLOUGH: No! No!  
(Turlough climbs the rails.)  
TURLOUGH: I will never serve you again!  
(Turlough jumps off the ship.)  
DOCTOR: No!

__**Part Three**__

**[Yacht deck]**

DOCTOR: Don't be an idiot.  
(Turlough floats off out of reach.)  
DOCTOR: Man overboard! Man overboard!  
(Jackson and two sailors come on board.)  
JACKSON: What's happened?  
DOCTOR: Man overboard. It's Turlough.  
JACKSON: Come on, lads, let's try and get a line to him.  
(They get a lifebelt.)  
JACKSON: Wait, the line's not attached.  
DOCTOR: Come on!  
TEGAN: Don't just stand there, do something. Stop the ship. Turn back.  
MARRINER: It would be ridiculous to risk losing the race for an Ephemeral.  
TEGAN: We can't leave him, he'll die out there.  
MARRINER: It will be over for him very quickly. His oxygen supply is very
small.  
(Turlough reaches for the lifebelt which is floating towards him. The Doctor
moves a brass telescope to get a good view.)  
JACKSON: Look, the Buccaneer. She's putting her sails about.  
MARRINER: She can't be.  
DOCTOR: Yes, she's heaving to.  
(The Buccaneer's crew haul Turlough on board in a net.)  
DOCTOR: He's safe. Come on.  
TEGAN: Where are you going?  
DOCTOR: To talk to Striker. We must get to that ship.  
(Jackson hands the line on the lifebelt over to a sailor.)  
JACKSON: You keep on that line, mate.  
(The sailor slowly pulls the lifebelt back on board as Jackson leaves.)  
MARRINER: It's surprising of Wrack.  
TEGAN: To save someone's life?  
MARRINER: To turn aside from the race.  
TEGAN: At least Turlough's safe.  
MARRINER: Is he? Your friend might be better dead than with the captain of
that ship.

**[Buccaneer stateroom]**

(Turlough has been divested of his spacesuit and is dragged through the
Buccaneer then thrown down onto a carpet by an African pirate.)  
MANSELL: Crawl.  
(Turlough crawls forward until he sees the shiny leather boots of a Lady
Buccaneer. Everyone say Hi! to  Linda Baron, last heard on Who singing the
Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon in the Gunfighters.)  
WRACK: Just what I've been waiting for.  
(She swishes a cutlass through the air above Turlough's head. He ducks.)  
WRACK: The balance is perfect. A handsome gift. For Captain Davy with my
compliments.  
MANSELL: A staggering jewel for a rival.  
WRACK: May it have as great an impact as my present to the Greek. Deliver it.
And these. But first, the invitation to Captain Striker. He can't refuse. Not
with live bait wriggling on the hook.

**[Yacht deck]**

MARRINER: Your friend is safe. We have received a message. I thought you would
like to know.  
TEGAN: Thank you. Where's the Doctor?  
MARRINER: The wheelhouse.  
TEGAN: I must go to him.  
(Tegan removes her helmet and sits by the railing with Marriner. The lifebelt
behind them gives the name of the yacht as The Shadow.)  
MARRINER: I hope you'll forgive me for saying so, but I've never experienced
such a mind as yours before.  
TEGAN: And you never will again.  
MARRINER: I find it such a fascinating place. Full of niches. Life. It
fascinates me. What are you doing?  
TEGAN: Work it out for yourself.  
MARRINER: You've killed your thoughts. You're hiding them from me.  
TEGAN: And that's the way it will remain until I find out exactly what's going
on here.  
MARRINER: Fascinating. I had no idea Ephemerals could be so entertaining.
Perhaps that's why Wrack stopped to pick up your friend.  
(A covered ship's boat is heading between the Buccaneer and the Shadow.)

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

(Striker is taking bearings.)  
STRIKER: Why did your friend jump?  
DOCTOR: I don't know, but we must get him back.  
STRIKER: He's made the choice.  
DOCTOR: It was an impulse. You know how impulsive the young are. No, I don't
suppose you do.  
(Marriner and Tegan enter, followed by Mansell.)  
MARRINER: We have received an invitation from Captain Wrack. A reception
aboard the Buccaneer.  
STRIKER: And delivered by hand. I'm overwhelmed.  
MARRINER: You will, of course, decline.  
STRIKER: Naturally.  
MARRINER: (to Mansell) Then we must detain you no longer.  
DOCTOR: We could collect Turlough.  
TEGAN: Can't we go?  
STRIKER: If you wish.  
MARRINER: Then I will escort you, with the Captain's permission. I shall
convey our acceptance to Captain Wrack.  
(Marriner hands the envelope back to Mansell, who leaves.)  
TEGAN: I thought you didn't want to go.  
MARRINER: I think you might need me. Captain Wrack has strange ideas
concerning entertainment.

**[Buccaneer wheelhouse]**

(Turlough is in manacles hanging from the chandelier.)  
WRACK: Have you ever seen a man flogged to death? Or keelhauled? Very painful.
You Ephemerals have such inventive ways of inflicting pain. Tell me, what do
you want aboard my ship?  
TURLOUGH: Why ask? I thought you could all read minds.  
WRACK: But yours is such a devious one. It's fascinating. I should like to
peel it away, layer by layer. Why did you come to me? Was your intention
sabotage? No? Then why did you come to my ship?  
TURLOUGH: Because you're going to win the race.  
WRACK: Am I? What makes you so sure?  
TURLOUGH: What others have said.  
WRACK: Ah, that I'm ruthless.  
TURLOUGH: Yes. I'm the same. I'm very determined, too. I like to win.  
WRACK: You please me.  
TURLOUGH: I also want to learn the secret of your power.  
WRACK: Power?  
TURLOUGH: To win. To control. To read minds.  
WRACK: Then open your mind. Don't resist. Show faith.  
(Wrack cuts Turlough down.)  
TURLOUGH: Thank you.  
(Mansell enters and hands Wrack the envelope.)  
MANSELL: Captain.  
WRACK: Your friends have accepted my invitation. They're concerned. How sweet.

**[Outside Tegan's cabin]**

DOCTOR: Hurry up, Tegan.  
TEGAN [OC]: I'm being as quick as I can.  
DOCTOR: Well, the launch'll be alongside in a moment.  
(Tegan steps out of her cabin in full Edwardian lady's dress. She's even
wearing a tiara.)  
DOCTOR: Hmm.  
(The ship lurches.)  
TEGAN: What is it?  
DOCTOR: We've been hit.  
TEGAN: We're under fire?  
(Marriner appears, in full evening dress.)  
MARRINER: Quick, follow me.  
(Another hit.)  
MARRINER: The wheelhouse.  
DOCTOR: Well, come along, come along.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

STRIKER: A point and a half to starboard.  
HELMSMAN: Aye, aye, sir.  
(Marriner enters, followed by the Doctor and Tegan.)  
MARRINER: Jib topsail's gone, sir.  
STRIKER: Take in more sail.  
MARRINER: Sir. Take in more sail, bo'sun. Batten down the hatches.  
DOCTOR: Asteroid storm.  
TEGAN: They must know how to avoid a collision with all their technology.  
DOCTOR: Well, they may not choose to use it. Against the rules of the race.  
TEGAN: We could be splintered to matchwood.  
MARRINER: Stand by hang the topsail. Find that sailmaker.  
DOCTOR: I don't think that worries them.

**[Buccaneer wheelhouse]**

(Wrack has taken the wheel.)  
MANSELL: Captain.  
WRACK: What is it?  
MANSELL: Davy's ship's gaining on us.  
WRACK: Good. We'll wait till they're alongside. You take the wheel and be
prepared to move away from her fast when I activate. (to Turlough) You come
with me.  
TURLOUGH: Where?  
WRACK: You wanted to see how I'm going to win the race.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

STRIKER: She's well trim now, Mister Mate.  
MARRINER: Yes, sir.  
TEGAN: What speed are we doing?  
DOCTOR: I don't know, but it's increasing.  
STRIKER: Steady.  
TEGAN: I hope they know what they're doing.  
DOCTOR: We're way ahead of the others. This ship can't help winning.  
TEGAN: Unless we're stopped by an asteroid.  
MARRINER: Davy's moving up on the Buccaneer, sir.

**[Outside the grid room]**

(Wrack moves a lever from vacuum shield off to on, then opens a metal bulkhead
door.)  
TURLOUGH: What is this place?  
WRACK: You'll find out.  
(She slams the door in his face and laughs.)  
TURLOUGH: What's going on?

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

TEGAN: What's happening?  
MARRINER: Davy's stealing the wind from the Buccaneer's sails.)  
STRIKER: And he's passing her.  
(In the Buccaneer's hold, Turlough hears voices then a massive jolt throws him
to the floor.)  
STRIKER: Hold her steady.  
TEGAN: Davy's ship!  
(Has just exploded.)

**[Outside the grid room]**

(Wrack comes back out of her secret room.)  
TURLOUGH: What have you done?  
WRACK: Improved my chance of winning.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

MARRINER: Davy's gone. Asteroid direct hit. Accidents will happen.  
DOCTOR: Especially to anyone who challenges Captain Wrack and the Buccaneer.  
MARRINER: What?  
DOCTOR: Have you forgotten the Greek who challenged Wrack's ship? I wonder if
the same thing will happen to us.  
(The speaking tube whistles.)  
MARRINER: Yes? Launch alongside, sir.  
STRIKER: My compliments to Captain Wrack.  
MARRINER: Shall we go?

**[Buccaneer stateroom]**

(Many different Earth races are present, including Oriental. A buffet table
has been laid out. Wrack enters in eighteenth century lady's dress followed by
Turlough.)  
MANSELL: Your friends will be arriving soon.  
TURLOUGH: The Doctor?  
MANSELL: And Miss Tegan and Mister Marriner.  
TURLOUGH: What do they want?  
MANSELL: I don't know, sir. Soon you'll be able to ask them yourself.

**[Buccaneer companionway]**

MARRINER: The stateroom is this way.  
TEGAN: I'm scared, Doctor.  
MARRINER: You've no need to be.

**[Buccaneer stateroom]**

(Marriner opens the door and the Doctor enters, followed by Tegan.)  
DOCTOR: Fascinating. A complete cross-section.  
TEGAN: Who are they?  
DOCTOR: Masters of sail, and if they're not, they're Eternals, like your
friend Marriner. To them it's just a game to pass the time. I can't see
Turlough.  
(Turlough is down below.)  
MARRINER: Champagne?  
TEGAN: Please.  
(Tegan takes a glass for herself and one for the Doctor, who is eyeing up the
celery.)  
MARRINER: Your friend isn't here.  
DOCTOR: I'd noticed.  
MARRINER: He isn't far. I can sense his thought patterns.  
(Wrack's laugh carries above the general background conversation.)  
TEGAN: Who's that?  
MARRINER: Your host, Captain Wrack.  
(Turlough has arrived at the metal bulkhead.)  
TEGAN: She's beautiful.  
DOCTOR: She's also an Eternal. Tegan.  
(The Doctor takes Tegan's champagne glass before she can take a sip.)  
WRACK: The wine doesn't please you?  
MARRINER: It's excellent.  
DOCTOR: But we don't have your remarkable constitutions.  
WRACK: You're too modest, Doctor. You're remarkable in other ways, for an
Ephemeral. (to Tegan) And you are so intriguing. My guests are begging to meet
you. You'll excuse us?  
DOCTOR: Of course.  
(The Doctor swaps his lapel celery for a new stick.)  
MARRINER: Your companion is a very beautiful woman.  
DOCTOR: Is she?  
MARRINER: The confusion in her mind is exhilarating.  
DOCTOR: Is it. Look, I need to find Turlough. Can you still sense his mind?  
MARRINER: Not clearly.  
(Turlough has turned the vacuum shield on, and finally shoulders his way into
Wrack's secret room. Set into the decking is a grill with a stylised eye which
is open to space.)  
MARRINER: I've found him. He's very faint.  
DOCTOR: Where is he? Concentrate.  
MARRINER: He is afraid  
DOCTOR: That should sharpen the image.  
MARRINER: Yes. The grid room. Ion chamber. I can see his mind quite clearly.  
DOCTOR: Where is the Ion chamber?  
MARRINER: Down. Down as far as you can go. Danger. The boy's in danger. It's
open to space. There's a vacuum shield.  
DOCTOR: Look after Tegan.  
MARRINER: Yes, of course.

**[Grid room]**

(A pirate locks the bulkhead door and moves the vacuum shield lever from on to
off. A big red sign tells Turlough of his danger, as if losing his air to
breathe didn't. Turlough gets out the Black Guardian's crystal.)  
TURLOUGH: Help me. Please!  
BLACK GUARDIAN: I warned you, boy. You have failed me. You will die.  
TURLOUGH: Please!  
(The Black Guardian vanishes with an evil laugh.)

**[Buccaneer companionway]**

DOCTOR: Which way? Which way?  
(The Doctor tosses a coin but doesn't like the result, so he tosses it again.)  
DOCTOR: Ah.

**[Buccaneer stateroom]**

(Wrack gently steers Tegan out of the room. Mansell stops Marriner from
following.)  
MANSELL: Mister Marriner, my friend.  
(Turlough toys with the idea of stepping onto the pupil of the eye in the
floor and being sucked out into space, but cannot do it. The stars he sees
through the grill starts swirling.)

**[Buccaneer companionway]**

(The Doctor comes down some steps.)  
DOCTOR: Has to be the right way.

**[Buccaneer wheelhouse]**

TEGAN: I thought you were taking me to meet someone.  
WRACK: I was, but they seem to have gone.  
TEGAN: Shall we return to the party?  
WRACK: Of course. But first.  
TEGAN: What.  
WRACK: Have you heard of time standing still?  
TEGAN: Oh yes, it's an expression. It means  
(Wrack waves her hand in front of Tegan's face.)  
WRACK: Exactly what it says. You will remain frozen in time till I have
finished with you, foolish Ephemeral.

**[Grid room]**

(Turlough tries the crystal again.)  
TURLOUGH: Help me, please. Help me!  
BLACK GUARDIAN [OC]: Die, boy.

**[Buccaneer hold]**

DOCTOR: Turlough?

**[Grid room]**

TURLOUGH: Help me. Help me! Help me! Doctor? Doctor, help me! Doctor!  
(The Black Guardian laughs.)  
TURLOUGH: Doctor!  
(The Doctor enters.)  
TURLOUGH: The vacuum shield.  
DOCTOR: I reset it.  
TURLOUGH: I thought I was going to die, explode in the vacuum of space.  
DOCTOR: No. What are you doing in here?  
TURLOUGH: Wrack. She said this place contains the secret of her power.  
DOCTOR: Did she? Well, it is part of the ion drive system.  
TURLOUGH: Why can the room be open to space?  
DOCTOR: Better reception. Interesting.  
TURLOUGH: What is it?  
DOCTOR: Wrack also uses this place as a receiver for something quite
different.  
TURLOUGH: What?  
DOCTOR: Do you know what that is?  
(On the ceiling above the grill is another eyes, this time a red one.)  
TURLOUGH: It's an eye.  
DOCTOR: Only in appearance. It's function is that of a massive amplifier.  
TURLOUGH: Is that what she used to destroy the other ships?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
TURLOUGH: So that's the secret of her power.  
DOCTOR: It's only part of it. There's still the question of focus.  
TURLOUGH: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: Well, Wrack only creates the power. She must have something to focus
it onto. Now, how do you think she manages that?  
(Wrack removes a gem from a casket in the wheelhouse.)  
TURLOUGH: How big would this point of focus have to be?  
DOCTOR: Oh, no bigger than this.  
(He holds his fingers about four centimetres apart.)  
DOCTOR: The clasp. That's why it was out of period.  
TURLOUGH: What are you talking about?  
DOCTOR: Critas the Greek.  
TURLOUGH: The first ship to be destroyed.  
DOCTOR: Wrack gave him a clasp as a present. She must have done. And then she
worked the same trick with Davy.  
TURLOUGH: She did. A sword. And it had a crystal on the hilt.  
DOCTOR: Well, that was it.  
TURLOUGH: Will she try the same thing with Striker?  
DOCTOR: Well, I can't see him or Marriner accepting anything from Wrack. They
don't trust her.  
TURLOUGH: Luckily for us.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that won't stop her. She'll find a way.

**[Buccaneer wheelhouse]**

(Wrack places the gem in Tegan's tiara.)  
WRACK: Perfect.

**[Grid room]**

TURLOUGH: Come along.  
DOCTOR: Wait a minute. Not until I've worked out some sort of plan.  
TURLOUGH: Do we have to stay here?  
DOCTOR: It's safer here. Far less likely to pick up my mind vibrations at this
level.  
TURLOUGH: What do you want to do?  
DOCTOR: I must find a way of staying on this ship.  
TURLOUGH: Why?  
DOCTOR: To stop Wrack winning.  
TURLOUGH: Let me stay, or don't you trust me yet.  
DOCTOR: You couldn't cope. These creatures have vast powers. That's why none
of them must win. To achieve further power would be a disaster.  
TURLOUGH: But the other ships. You can't stop all of them.  
DOCTOR: We can but try.

**[Outside the grid room]**

(The Doctor walks out of the ion chamber straight into a group of armed
pirates.)  
MANSELL: Resist any further, Doctor, and you will regret it.

**[Buccaneer wheelhouse]**

WRACK: Oh, Doctor, you're such a fool. Did you really think your Ephemeral
mind could defeat me? You've lost. All that awaits is your ultimate
destruction. Bwahahahahahahaha!

__**Part Four**__

**[Buccaneer wheelhouse]**

WRACK: Now, where were we? Ah, yes. Have you heard of time standing still?  
(Wrack waves her hand in front of Tegan's face, and she wakes up.)  
TEGAN: Yes, it's an expression. It means. Why have you brought me here?  
WRACK: I wanted you to meet someone, but they seem to have gone.  
TEGAN: I'd like to rejoin the party, too, please.  
WRACK: As you wish. I too would like to speak to the Doctor. The image of him
in your mind is quite intriguing.

**[Buccaneer stateroom]**

(The Doctor and Turlough are being hustled back up from the Ion chamber and
hold.)  
TEGAN: Can't see him anywhere.  
WRACK: No, but there's Marriner, longing for your company.  
TEGAN: Yes.  
WRACK: Don't let me keep you.  
MARRINER: I've been looking for you everywhere.  
TEGAN: Really?  
MARRINER: I was worried. Where did Wrack take you?  
TEGAN: The wheelhouse.  
MARRINER: You're unharmed?  
TEGAN: Of course.  
MARRINER: I was concerned for you.  
TEGAN: Thank you. It was unnecessary.  
MARRINER: I missed you. I was concerned. I am empty without you.  
TEGAN: Go away. Please?  
MARRINER: You are life itself. Without you I am nothing. Don't you understand?  
TEGAN: What?  
MARRINER: I am empty. You give me being. I look into your mind and see life,
energy, excitement. I want them. I want you. Your thoughts should be my
thoughts. Your feelings, my feelings.  
TEGAN: Wait a minute. Are you trying to tell me you're in love?  
MARRINER: Love? What is love? I want existence.

**[Buccaneer companionway]**

(Wrack meets Mansell and his prisoners.)  
MANSELL: I found them coming out of the grid room.  
TURLOUGH: He's a spy. I saw him wandering around and followed him in.  
MANSELL: Then what were you doing in the grid room?  
TURLOUGH: I followed him in.  
MANSELL: Why didn't you summon help?  
TURLOUGH: From where? When you found me, I was trying to apprehend him myself.  
WRACK: Spying, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Well, I'd hardly call it spying. We were welcomed as guests, given the
freedom of the ship.  
WRACK: And you think freedom extends to a door marked 'Danger'? (to Turlough)
What shall we do with your friend the spy?  
TURLOUGH: Get rid of him.  
WRACK: Ah. How?  
TURLOUGH: I mean, send him back. Send them all back to Striker.  
WRACK: And what about you?

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

STRIKER: Check to see if the repair to the sail is complete.  
HELMSMAN: Aye, aye, sir.  
(Striker takes the wheel as the helmsman goes to the speaking tube.)

**[Buccaneer companionway]**

TEGAN: All right, all right, don't push. Where's Turlough?  
MANSELL: You will board the launch now.  
TEGAN: What about Turlough?  
DOCTOR: He's staying.  
TEGAN: You can't let them do that.  
MANSELL: The launch. Now.  
(Marriner is escorted away.)  
TEGAN: You can't let them keep him.  
DOCTOR: You don't understand. It was his idea. He wanted to stay. Come on.  
(Further on.)  
TEGAN: Why?  
(The Doctor stoops to tie his shoelace.)  
DOCTOR: Wrack mustn't win the race. He's stayed to prevent her.  
TEGAN: You believe that?  
DOCTOR: Well, I think he wants to prove himself. At least, I hope so.  
MANSELL: Move!

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

STRIKER: As soon as Mister Marriner's party's aboard, prepare to get underway.

**[Buccaneer wheelhouse]**

WRACK: Your friends have gone.  
TURLOUGH: Good riddance.  
WRACK: Drink? My thanks for detecting the spy, and for choosing to stay with
me. But I wonder why?  
TURLOUGH: I told you, I like to be on the winning side.  
WRACK: You do? And you want a share of the winnings?  
TURLOUGH: Yes.  
WRACK: Even though you're not sure what they are?  
TURLOUGH: I'm sure the prize is a rich one.  
WRACK: Oh, it is. Enlightenment.  
TURLOUGH: In what way?  
WRACK: In every way. When I have it, I shall no longer depend on Ephemeral
minds. Everything conceived in time, from the beginning to the end, will be
clear to me. I shall create and destroy as I wish. I'll never be bored again.  
TURLOUGH: Destroy?  
WRACK: Enlightenment brings whatever one desires. I desire to be amused. I
have a new toy to show you. Come. See how I entertain my guests.  
(A plank is extended out over the hull of the ship.)  
TURLOUGH: What are they doing?  
WRACK: It's the plank. An ingenious Ephemeral idea for disposing of those who
stand in one's way.

**[Outside Tegan's cabin]**

TEGAN: I'm going to change. I've had about enough of this outfit.  
MARRINER: I too must change and go back to the wheelhouse. We're nearly into
the final leg.  
DOCTOR: Er, I'm going to the wheelhouse.

**[Tegan's cabin]**

(Tegan throws the tiara with Wrack's gemstone onto the bed.)  
TEGAN: I'll be with you in a minute.

**[Buccaneer wheelhouse]**

(Turlough and Wrack watch as a Chinaman is made to walk, or rather crawl, the
plank. As he jumps off, he vanishes to great cheers.)  
TURLOUGH: They just disappear.  
WRACK: They're out of the race. They're like me. We do not exist in time,
therefore there is no moment of time that can see us cease to be. We are
Eternals. They'll survive, merely transfer. You Ephemerals are different. You
die so easily. Shall we see? One of the crew, perhaps.  
TURLOUGH: No.  
WRACK: Shall we join them on deck?  
TURLOUGH: Why?  
WRACK: They're waiting for you.  
TURLOUGH: No. You don't understand.  
WRACK: I understand perfectly. The Doctor's not the only spy.  
TURLOUGH: I wasn't spying.  
WRACK: You forget I can see into an Ephemeral mind, even a murky one such as
yours.  
TURLOUGH: But I'm on your side! I just wanted a share, just some of the prize.  
WRACK: You wanted it all. Your mind is divided, confused, hard to read
sometimes, but one thing is clear in it always. Greed. Take him away. He bores
me.  
TURLOUGH: No, listen! The power outside the Ion chamber. I heard the power
that speaks to you. I heard it and I know the voice. He speaks to me as well.
I serve him, as I wish to serve you.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

(There are cheers outside on the deck as the Doctor and Marriner enter.)  
STRIKER: The Enlighteners, there they are. Gentlemen, we are nearly there.  
(Something is shimmering not quite in this dimension.)  
STRIKER: More sail, Mister Mate. Cram on everything she's got.  
MARRINER: More sail, bo'sun. Cram on everything we've got.  
(Tegan enters.)  
TEGAN: What's happening?  
MARRINER: Empty that sail locker.  
DOCTOR: The race is nearly over.

**[Yacht deck]**

SAILORS: Heave! Heave! Heave!

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

MARRINER: We're pulling away.  
STRIKER: We'll show her a clean pair of heels.  
DOCTOR: Not yet.  
MARRINER: Look, Captain.  
DOCTOR: They've hoisted their moonrakers.

**[Buccaneer wheelhouse]**

WRACK: A surprise for Captain Striker.  
MANSELL: We're gaining on them.  
WRACK: Good. I want us lying level. You shall serve me too. Come with me. We
will go to our Guardian and together we will listen to his voice.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

STRIKER: Wrack, she's still moving up on us.  
MARRINER: Those moonrakers are giving her the edge.  
TEGAN: What are moonrakers?  
DOCTOR: Pirate sails for speed. With those, they're faster than we are.  
STRIKER: Hold her steady.  
TEGAN: They can overtake us?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
MARRINER: Wrack's ship is level, but we're holding her.  
DOCTOR: They can pass us any time they want.  
TEGAN: Then why aren't they?  
DOCTOR: Why indeed?  
MARRINER: Still holding level.  
DOCTOR: No! You've got it the wrong way round. She's holding level with us!
She's moved in for the kill.

**[Outside the grid room]**

(Wrack turns on the vacuum shield.)  
WRACK: Now, open that door.  
(Turlough obeys, and Wrack walks through.)

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

DOCTOR: I tell you, that's how she was positioned when the Greek ship
exploded. She was lying level. And when Davy's ship was destroyed, practically
alongside, don't you remember?  
STRIKER: More sail, Mister Mate.  
MARRINER: That's everything we've got.  
DOCTOR: We can't pull away from her. She's got us where she wants us.  
STRIKER: More sail!  
MARRINER: More sail, bo'sun!  
DOCTOR: We must find the focus.  
TEGAN: What?  
DOCTOR: She must have done it. She must have got it aboard somehow. Did she
give you anything when we were on board her ship? Anything at all? Think!  
TEGAN: No.  
DOCTOR: It has to be here somewhere. It has to be.  
TEGAN: What?  
DOCTOR: The point of focus. Without it, the power she channels is useless.  
MARRINER: What power?  
DOCTOR: The power of darkness.  
(The power is building up. Wrack stands on the hole in the middle of the eye
and is enveloped in black, with only her head visible.)  
TEGAN: What would the focus look like?  
DOCTOR: Well, it could be anything. Probably a crystal of some sort. So big,
perhaps. Could be part of a jewel, a clasp, the hilt of a sword.  
TEGAN: Part of a jewel.

**[Grid room]**

WRACK: Speak to me. Come to me.  
BLACK GUARDIAN [OC]: I am here.

**[Yacht companionway]**

DOCTOR: Which way?  
MARRINER: Along there.  
TEGAN: It was there, like a ruby, right in the centre of the tiara.  
MARRINER: So that's why Wrack took you to the wheelhouse.  
DOCTOR: Come on!

**[Grid room]**

(The Black Guardian's voice comes from Wrack's mouth.)  
BLACK GUARDIAN [OC]: Focus. Focus. Your mind is a channel through which power
will flow. Focus your mind.  
(The gem in the tiara begins to glow. The Doctor grabs a fire axe from the
panelled wall as they run.)  
BLACK GUARDIAN [OC]: Focus. Focus. Focus. Focus. Focus.  
(The Doctor dashes into Tegan's cabin, snatches the tiara from the bed and
puts it on the floor, then smashes it with the axehead.)  
BLACK GUARDIAN [OC]: Focus. Focus. Focus.  
(Wrack's face multiplies in the black column, then they start to swirl
around.)  
BLACK GUARDIAN [OC]: Focus. Focus. Focus. Focus. Focus. Focus. Focus. Focus.
Focus. Focus.

**[Tegan's cabin]**

TEGAN: What is it? What's happening to it?  
DOCTOR: I can't destroy it. I'm a fool. Its power's multiplying. I have to get
rid of it. Help me!  
(Tegan and Marriner help the Doctor gather the tiny shards into a
handkerchief, then follow him as he runs out.)

**[Yacht companionway]**

TEGAN: Where's he going?  
MARRINER: The deck.  
BLACK GUARDIAN [OC]: Focus. Focus. Focus.

**[Yacht deck]**

(The Doctor collapses then drags himself to the railing and throws the
handkerchief overboard.)  
BLACK GUARDIAN [OC]: Focus. Focus.  
(Marriner goes to the Doctor. The shards go KaBOOM!)

**[Grid room]**

(Wrack returns to herself.)  
WRACK: Striker's ship still exists!

**[Yacht deck]**

DOCTOR: Just in time.  
MARRINER: Fascinating. For an Ephemeral to outwit an Eternal. I would have
thought it an impossibility.  
DOCTOR: Impossibility? Not at all.  
MARRINER: We have control over matter. Had you merely imagined it in space, I
could have converted the image into reality without so much effort.  
TEGAN: Then why didn't you?  
DOCTOR: Because he didn't think of it. They're far more dependant on us than
we are on them. Without us, they're empty nothings.  
TEGAN: What is it?  
MARRINER: The wind, it's dying.

**[Grid room]**

MANSELL: Captain.  
WRACK: I know. Striker's ship's still whole.  
MANSELL: But he's becalmed. The winds have dropped.  
WRACK: Ah, then I must be content with victory.  
TURLOUGH: How can you, if there's no wind?  
WRACK: My sails can catch the slightest whisper of a breeze. The race is ours,
and the prize.

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

(Striker is using a speaking tube.)  
STRIKER: Bo'sun. Bo'sun!  
(Marriner enters.)  
STRIKER: Mister Marriner, victory's in sight and we idle here, sails hanging
limp. Get the men aloft!  
MARRINER: There's no point. There is no wind, Captain.  
STRIKER: Wrack is pulling away from us. She's going to win!  
MARRINER: Then we are beaten.  
DOCTOR: Not quite. Don't forget Turlough's over there.  
TEGAN: Him?  
DOCTOR: If I'm to stop Wrack winning, I need my Tardis.  
STRIKER: Very well.  
TEGAN: Where is it?  
STRIKER: Hidden in the Doctor's mind.  
MARRINER: Doctor, concentrate.  
(The Tardis is in the wheelhouse.)  
TEGAN: Will the Tardis still function? The console blew up.  
DOCTOR: Oh, probably did it the world of good. Come on, no time to waste.  
MARRINER: Miss Tegan stays with me.  
DOCTOR: No.  
MARRINER: She stays or you both stay.  
STRIKER: Wrack is completely outstripping us!  
DOCTOR: I'll be back. I hope.  
STRIKER: She has almost won.

**[Grid room]**

(The Tardis materialises outside the grid room, and the Doctor rushes in as
Wrack tries to reestablish contact with the Black Guardian.)  
DOCTOR: No, wait! The power you're tapping. You think it's under your control?
It isn't. It will control you. You don't understand what it is.  
WRACK: You have no time left. Throw him into the void.  
DOCTOR: No, Turlough.  
(Mansell holds the Doctor's shoulders and pulls him back over the hole in the
floor.)

**[Yacht wheelhouse]**

TEGAN: What's the Doctor doing?  
(A light floats out from the Buccaneer.)  
TEGAN: What was that?  
STRIKER: Man overboard.  
TEGAN: Not the Doctor, it couldn't be.  
MARRINER: The ship is still moving.  
STRIKER: And she hasn't even slackened speed.  
MARRINER: The Doctor has failed.  
(Two bodies are floating in space.)  
STRIKER: And Wrack has won.  
MARRINER: The race is over.  
TEGAN: Is the Doctor dead?  
STRIKER: I don't know.  
MARRINER: The sparkle has gone from your mind. There are only grey shadows
there. I see grief. What is grief?  
STRIKER: Come. We must cross to Wrack's ship.  
TEGAN: Why?  
STRIKER: She has won. We must pay homage.

**[Buccaneer stateroom]**

(On the Buccaneer, the crew vanish. In the stateroom, both Guardians appear.
The Black Guardian puts a ball on the table and removes the top. They shield
their eyes from the blinding light.)  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Let the victor receive his prize. You will never destroy the
light.  
BLACK GUARDIAN: Others shall do it for me.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Destroy the light and you destroy yourself. Dark cannot exist
without knowledge of light.  
BLACK GUARDIAN: Nor light without dark. Your powers are waning.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Others will recharge them for me.  
(The Guardians sit opposite each other.)  
BLACK GUARDIAN: These creatures have no knowledge of good or evil.
Enlightenment will give them power. They will invade time itself. Chaos will
come again, and the universe will dissolve. Where is the Captain of this ship?
Where is the Captain to receive the prize?  
DOCTOR: I'm afraid the Captain can't be with us. She met with a rather
unfortunate accident. Both the Captain and the First Mate fell overboard. I
brought the ship into harbour with some assistance.  
BLACK GUARDIAN: You lie!  
DOCTOR: I leave the lies and deception to you.  
BLACK GUARDIAN: Take care, Doctor. You have not defeated me. You have merely
won a minor skirmish. The war still goes on.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: It seems Enlightenment is yours, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: I'm not ready for it. I don't think anyone is, especially Eternals.  
(Striker, Marriner and Tegan enter.)  
TEGAN: Doctor, I thought you  
DOCTOR: Yes. Not now, Tegan.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: You're right, Doctor. Let the Eternals return to the place
from which they came.  
MARRINER: No. I want to stay.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Back to your echoing void, back to the vastness of eternity.  
MARRINER: Tegan, help me.  
TEGAN: I can't.  
MARRINER: I need you.  
(As Marriner stretches out his hand to her, he and Striker fade away.)  
TEGAN: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: There's nothing we can do.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: You were right, Doctor, in judging no one is fit to claim all
Enlightenment. I can, however, allocate a share to you, Turlough.  
TURLOUGH: Me?  
WHITE GUARDIAN: You assisted in bringing the ship to harbour.  
(The White Guardian removes a second lid from the glowing ball, to reveal a
jagged crystal.)  
TURLOUGH: It's diamond. The size. It could buy a galaxy. I can have that?  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Yes.  
BLACK GUARDIAN: I would point out that under our agreement, it is mine.
Unless, of course, you wish to surrender something else in its place. The
Doctor is in your debt for his life. Give me the Doctor, and you can have
this, the Tardis, whatever you wish.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Consider, Turlough. Which will you give him? The Doctor, or
this? The choice is yours.  
(The White Guardian pushes 'Enlightenment' towards Turlough.)  
TURLOUGH: Here, take it!  
(Turlough flings 'Enlightenment' at the Black Guardian, who bursts into
flames, screaming.)  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Light destroys the dark. I think you will find your contract
terminated.  
(Turlough gets the crystal from his trouser pocket. It has turned black, so he
drops it into the flames.)  
TURLOUGH: I never wanted the agreement in the first place.  
DOCTOR: I believe you.  
TEGAN: You're mad.  
TURLOUGH: What I've said is true.  
TEGAN: You believe him because he gave up Enlightenment for your sake.  
DOCTOR: You're missing the point. Enlightenment was not the diamond.
Enlightenment was the choice.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: Be vigilant, Doctor. Once, you denied him the Key to Time.
Now, you have thwarted him again. He will be waiting for the third encounter,
and his power does not diminish.  
TURLOUGH: But the Black Guardian is destroyed.  
WHITE GUARDIAN: While I exist, he exists also, until we are no longer needed.  
(The White Guardian fades away.)  
TEGAN: Let's get away from here.  
DOCTOR: Anywhere in particular?  
TURLOUGH: Yes. My planet. My home.  
DOCTOR: Why not?
