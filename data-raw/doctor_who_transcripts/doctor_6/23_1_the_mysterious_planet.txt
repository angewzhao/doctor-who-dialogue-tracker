Original Airdate: 6 Sep, 1986  

__**Part One**__

**[Space Station]**

(As the updated theme tune closes, a bell tolls and we zoom in on then tour a
massive space station. A circular hatch opens and a beam of light lances out
into the void, ensnaring the Tardis and dragging it in. The Tardis
materialises by a staircase and the Doctor stumbles out. He shakes his head to
clear it, then goes up the steps and nearly knocks on the doors at the top.
Changing his mind, he pushes them open and walks into -)

**[** **Trial room]**

(A darkened room. A figure sits in a pew. Everyone say Hi! to  Michael
Jayston.)  
VALEYARD: At last, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Am I late for something?  
VALEYARD: I was beginning to fear you had lost yourself. Sit down.  
(The Doctor moves to where the Valeyard indicates, to discover a chair. The
Valeyard then turns on the lights and we see that the chair is in a dock.)  
DOCTOR: Well, even I would find it hard to lose myself in a corridor.
Especially, when propelled by the mental energy of so many distinguished Time
Lords.  
(The Doctor waves at a group of shadowy figures in the formal Time Lord
costume sitting in two raised rows of pews by the wall to his left.)  
VALEYARD: Oh, I don't know. You seem to have a great talent for straying from
the straight and narrow.  
(Citadel guards enter and the lights come up to full as a woman in white robe
with a red scarf is escorted to a separate chair and table below the rows of
Time Lords. Everyone wave Hi! to  Lynda Bellingham.)  
DOCTOR: Would it be too much to ask what all this is about?  
INQUISITOR: The accused will remain silent until invited to speak.  
DOCTOR: The accused? Do you mean me?  
INQUISITOR: I call upon the Valeyard to open the case.  
VALEYARD: By order of the High Council, this is an impartial enquiry into the
behaviour of the accused person, known as the Doctor, who is charged that he,
on diverse occasions has been guilty of conduct unbecoming a Time Lord.  
DOCTOR: Not guilty!  
VALEYARD: He is also charged with, on diverse occasions, transgressing the
First Law. It is my unpleasant task, Madam Inquisitor, to prove to the enquiry
that the Doctor is an incorrigible meddler in the affairs of other peoples and
planets.  
INQUISITOR: Yes. I see, Valeyard, that it is on record that the Doctor has
faced trial already for offences of this nature.  
VALEYARD: That is so, my lady, and I shall contend that the High Council
showed too great a leniency on that occasion.  
INQUISITOR: Very well. Doctor, you've heard the charges. Do you wish to say
anything before the enquiry proceeds?  
DOCTOR: Only that this whole thing is a farce. I am Lord President of
Gallifrey. You can't put me on trial.  
INQUISITOR: Doctor, since you willfully neglected the responsibility of your
great office, you were deposed.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Is that legal?  
INQUISITOR: Perfectly. But we won't hold it against you. Quite the contrary in
fact. And to see that your interests are fully protected, I propose to appoint
a court defender to represent you.  
DOCTOR: Ah, oh, er, thank you, but no thank you. I have been through several
such inquiries before. I think it would be easier if I speak for myself.  
INQUISITOR: The court notes the Doctor refuses the services of a court
defender. Proceed, Valeyard.  
VALEYARD: Inquisitor, I am not proposing to waste the time of the court by
dwelling in detail on the activities of the accused.  
DOCTOR: Good.  
VALEYARD: Instead, I intend to adumbrate two typical instances from separate
epistopic interfaces of the spectrum. These examples of the criminal behaviour
of the accused are fully recorded in the Matrix, the repository of all
knowledge.  
_DOCTOR: Objection.  
INQUISITOR: I hear the accused. What is this objection?  
DOCTOR: The Matrix does not contain all knowledge. It merely contains all Time
Lord knowledge.  
INQUISITOR: It has long been accepted that the Matrix is the repository of all
knowledge.  
DOCTOR: Well, that only shows the insular complacency of this society. How do
you know that there isn't knowledge that you don't possess?  
INQUISITOR: All that is known is within the Matrix.  
DOCTOR: Oh, a micro-organism in a drop of water might think it knows the
universe. All it knows is that drop of water.  
VALEYARD: I think this is merely a semantic point, my lady.  
INQUISITOR: I agree. I find the objection of the accused to be not valid.
Please continue.  
VALEYARD: Thank you, my lady. _ (Everyone in the court turns to a screen high
on the wall above the ranks of Time Lords.)  
VALEYARD: I should like to begin with the Doctor's involvement in the affairs
of Ravalox, a planet within the Stellian galaxy.

_**[Ravalox]** _

_(The Tardis materialises and Peri steps out. It is raining.)  
PERI: Oh, great.  
DOCTOR: Hang on.  
(The Doctor fetches a jacket and umbrella.)  
DOCTOR: There.  
PERI: Can't we come back some other time, like when it's not raining?  
DOCTOR: Oh, stop whinging.  
PERI: I don't understand why you wanted to come here in the first place.  
DOCTOR: Then you should have listened more carefully.  
(The Doctor walks off.)  
PERI: Hey! Don't I get some?  
DOCTOR: Oh, sorry. _

_**[** **Trial room]** _

_VALEYARD: I draw your attention, my lady, to the admission of the accused
that he obtained access to confidential material from Gallifrey. A file privy
only to members of the High Council.  
INQUISITOR: That is noted. Doctor, why did you go to Ravalox?  
DOCTOR: Simple scientific curiosity. I'm not so egotistic as to believe all
knowledge is at my fingertips.  
INQUISITOR: Your crude sarcasm is also noted. I should warn you, Doctor, that
your hostile attitude is not helpful.  
DOCTOR: I'm not here to help. And while you're making all those notes, do
please note that I did not have access to confidential material. The fireball
that destroyed Ravalox is documented in Extinct Civilisations by Warris
Bossard.  
ORDERLY: This is true, my lady.  
INQUISITOR: I see. I find the point that the Doctor gained access to
confidential material to be not proven, unless you have further evidence,
Valeyard.  
VALEYARD: It is not of great importance, my lady.  
INQUISITOR: Continue.  
VALEYARD: Most certainly. _

**[Ravalox]**

(The Doctor and Peri are strolling in an autumnal forest, under a large and
garish golf umbrella. We're back at the Queen Elizabeth Country Park,
Horndean.)  
PERI: I don't think I like Ravalox very much. It reminds me of a wet November
back on Earth.  
DOCTOR: Now that's part of the reason why we're here.  
PERI: Huh?  
DOCTOR: Well, Ravalox has the same mass, angle of tilt and period of rotation
as Earth.  
PERI: So?  
DOCTOR: Well I thought that was quite interesting. It's unusual to find two
planets so similar. In fact, it's quite a phenomenon.  
PERI: Oh, pity it couldn't be a dry one.  
DOCTOR: Ravalox also has the distinction of having been destroyed by a solar
fireball.  
PERI: It doesn't look very destroyed.  
DOCTOR: According to the records on Gallifrey, it was devastated by a solar
fireball some five centuries ago. I think somebody exaggerated, don't you?  
PERI: Hmm.  
DOCTOR: Hmm.  
(A little further on, the drizzle has stopped so the Doctor puts the umbrella
down.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, the exhilarating smell of a freshly laundered forest. Can't beat
it.  
PERI: And the twittering of tiny birds and the rustling of small mammals as
they forage for food in the undergrowth.  
DOCTOR: Exactly.  
PERI: Then you've better hearing than me. There aren't any birds. Listen.  
DOCTOR: I wondered when you'd notice.  
PERI: None of this makes any sense. Any soil left after the visitation of a
fireball would be sterile.  
DOCTOR: Well done.  
PERI: Don't patronise me Doctor. You knew from the start this amount of growth
wasn't possible.  
DOCTOR: I also knew, that as a student of botany, you'd soon realise the truth
without any prompting from me.  
PERI: Maybe.  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
PERI: Is there any intelligent life here?  
DOCTOR: Apart from me, you mean? I don't know. Shall we find out?  
(As the Doctor and Peri move off down a path, they are watched by a pair of
men. The younger one speaks to Tony Selby.)  
DIBBER: Well, they're not from round here, Mister Glitz.  
GLITZ: I know that, Dibber.  
(The Doctor spots something by the path.)  
DOCTOR: Ah ha! Look at this.  
(It is a necklace. He hooks it up with the umbrella.)  
DOCTOR: We are certainly not on this planet alone. Mmm hmm. Let's reconnoiter,
shall we?  
(The two men prepare their weapons. Glitz screws a silencer onto his gun.)  
GLITZ: You know, Dibber, I'm the product of a broken home.  
DIBBER: You have mentioned it on occasions, Mister Glitz.  
GLITZ: Which sort of unbalanced me. Made me selfish to the point where I
cannot stand competition.  
DIBBER: Know the feeling only too well, Mister Glitz.  
GLITZ: Where as yours is a simple case of sociopathy, Dibber, my malaise is
much more complex. A deep-rooted maladjustment, my psychiatrist said. Brought
on by an infantile inability to come to terms with the more pertinent,
concrete aspects of life.  
DIBBER: That sounds more like an insult than a diagnosis, Mister Glitz.  
GLITZ: You're right there, my lad. Mind you, I had just attempted to kill him.
Oh, I do hate prison psychiatrists, don't you? I mean, they do nothing for
you. I must have seen dozens of them, and I still hate competition. Especially
when it poaches my territory. I'm going to enjoy this.  
(Glitz has the Doctor in the cross-hairs of his viewfinder, then the Doctor
drops out of sight.)  
GLITZ: Too late! Oh, I do hate it when people get lucky. It really offends my
sensibilities.  
DIBBER: Shouldn't we go after them?  
GLITZ: How is it they know where to look? Tell me that, Dibber.  
DIBBER: I don't know. Maybe they've all copied the same map we did. Do you
want me to go after them?  
GLITZ: Why? Do you want to help them?  
DIBBER: No, it's just that if we're after the same thing as us  
GLITZ: Don't worry. They'll soon be dead. It's just that I wanted the personal
pleasure of killing them myself.  
(The Doctor and Peri have gone down a slope.)  
PERI: Oh, here, Doctor, look.  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
(Peri has found a stone carving or plaque in the slope they've just come
down.)  
DOCTOR: The remains of a building.  
PERI: And we're not going inside.  
DOCTOR: Of course not, we can't. We haven't found the entrance yet. This is
the type of place where some early life forms might have survived. Come along.  
PERI: I'm just not crazy about meeting any early life forms.  
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yeah.  
(Dibber and Glitz put their weapons away.)  
DIBBER: Well, if we've got competition, going to the village could be a
valuable waste of time.  
GLITZ: That complex down there is still functional, which means the L3 robot
is operational.  
DIBBER: I understand.  
GLITZ: To render the robot non-operational, we have to destroy the light
converter which supplies its energy system.  
DIBBER: I know all that.  
GLITZ: Then why are you arguing with me? It's not my fault if a bunch of
backward savages have turned a Magnum Mark Seven light converter into a totem
pole.  
DIBBER: It's just that I think we should kill those two first.  
GLITZ: And meet the robot head on at full power? I don't think you have my
full interests at heart, Dibber.  
DIBBER: If the robot doesn't kill them before we destroy his energy supply,
well, they could be up and away with the goods before we've even got back from
the village.  
GLITZ: I know that, Dibber. Now you understand why I hate competition. It
spoils everything.  
DIBBER: I still think we should kill them.  
GLITZ: We will, Dibber, we will. When the time is right.  
(Down at the structure, the Doctor is studying the remains.)  
PERI: Doctor, I know this sounds crazy, but I have the weirdest feeling that
I've been here before.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I often get that feeling. Of course, I usually have. In your
case, it's not possible.  
PERI: Well, possible or not, I want to get away from here.  
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right. We must find out what's going on here.  
_PERI: This place is spooky. It's like an overgrown fallout shelter.  
DOCTOR: Hmm. You're partly right. This must have been their last desperate
attempt to escape the coming fireball.  
PERI: Well, who lived on this planet?  
DOCTOR: Now that's something of a mystery. There's strangely little about
Ravalox in the records of Gallifrey. Obviously they were a fairly advanced
species. Look.  
(The Doctor pulls aside vegetation to reveal the plaque. Then he finds a
tunnel entrance.)  
_ DOCTOR: Ah ha! That's it. _You know, you can deduce an awful lot about a
civilisation from its art.  
PERI: What?  
DOCTOR: You know, I might stay here a couple of years and write a thesis about
that. _Come along.  
(The Doctor goes into the tunnel. Peri looks around.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Peri?

**[Tunnel]**

PERI: I've scratched myself.

**[Underground station]**

(They go down what looks like a very short escalator to an area with cables
along the wall.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, you're young. You'll soon heal.  
PERI: Thanks for the sympathy.  
DOCTOR: You know, I'm glad I decided to come here. I might stay here for a
year or so and write a thesis. Ancient Life on Ravalox by Doctor  
PERI: Doctor, look! There's something here I think you should see.  
(As they explore, they are being watched.)

**[Ravalox]**

_GLITZ: I heard it.  
DIBBER: Over here.  
_ (Dibber and Glitz hide behind a large gnarled tree as a line of people walk
along in the distance.)  
GLITZ: Look at them, primitive screeves.  
DIBBER: Are they from the village?  
GLITZ: Must be.  
DIBBER: Well then, let's make it a few less we'll have to deal with.  
GLITZ: No. All we need is a gesture of strength. Show them they haven't got a
chance.  
(Glitz throws a flash-bang at the people.)  
GLITZ: Amazing the affect a loud bang can have on the primitive mind.  
(They walk towards the natives.)  
GLITZ: Come here, you ignorant, maggot ridden peasant. Somehow I always feel
foolish saying this. Take me to your leader.

**[Underground station]**

(There is a metal sign fallen on the floor of the curved tunnel.)  
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose there is a billion to one chance there was a place
called Marble Arch on Ravalox.  
PERI: And they wrote in English?  
DOCTOR: Well, that's another billion to one chance. It does begin to seem a
little unlikely, doesn't it?  
PERI: Oh, Doctor, we're on Earth aren't we? I said it felt like Earth.  
DOCTOR: It's in the wrong part of space for it to be your planet. Besides,
according to all the record books, this is Ravalox.  
PERI: Well then, how do you explain this?  
DOCTOR: Well, they. I can't. Not yet. Unless of course, perhaps they collected
railway stations.  
PERI: That's ridiculous.  
DOCTOR: But not impossible, though. Not as impossible as the other
explanation.  
PERI: What's that?  
DOCTOR: Well, that somehow or other your planet and its entire constellation
managed to shift itself a couple of light years across space, after which, for
some reason, it became known as Ravalox.  
PERI: Well, what time are we in?  
DOCTOR: Oh, a long time after your period.  
(He checks his pocket watch.)  
DOCTOR: Er, two billion years or more.  
PERI: So what happened to London?  
DOCTOR: Wiped out, if this was London.  
PERI: Doctor, I know it is. I can feel it.  
DOCTOR: Now, don't get emotional.  
PERI: Don't get emotional. This cinder we're standing on is all that's left of
my world. Everything I knew.

**[** **Trial room]**

DOCTOR: Why do I have to sit here watching Peri getting upset, while two
unsavoury adventurers bully a bunch of natives.  
VALEYARD: The reason will be made clear shortly, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: As a matter of interest, where is Peri?  
VALEYARD: Where you left her.  
DOCTOR: Where's that?  
VALEYARD: You don't remember? Obviously a side effect of being taken out of
time. The amnesia should soon pass.  
INQUISITOR: Shall we continue?  
DOCTOR: Well, can't we just have the edited highlights?

**[Underground station]**

DOCTOR: I know how you feel.  
PERI: Do you?  
DOCTOR: Of course I do. You've been travelling with me long enough to know
that none of this really matters. Not to you. Your world is safe.  
PERI: This is still my world, whatever the period, and I care about it. And
all you do is talk about it as though we're in a planetarium.  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. But look at it this way. Planets come and go, stars perish.
Matter disperses, coalesces, reforms into other patterns, other worlds.
Nothing can be eternal.  
PERI: I know what you mean, and I still want to get away from here.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I can't. There's a mystery here. Questions to which I must have an
answer. Look, Peri. Peri.  
(They go over to a door which was never at the original Marble Arch station.
It slides open.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, hermetically sealed, leading down to a lower level. Now, some of
the original inhabitants might have survived down there. You coming?  
PERI: No. I've seen enough. I'll wait you at the entrance. Where they used to
sell candy bars and newspapers.  
DOCTOR: All right, shan't be long. Don't go wandering off. Be careful.  
(The Doctor leaves with the torch, and Peri stumbles on some rubble.)  
PERI: Ow.  
(The Doctor returns.)  
DOCTOR: I said be careful.  
(The Doctor leaves again.)  
PERI: Of what? The spooks and ghosts you're always telling me don't exist.
Hey! You could have left me the umbrella! Oh, please yourself. I don't mind
getting wet.  
(Peri goes back along the platform, straight into the arms of two men carrying
spears. She screams.)

**[Village]**

(Simple wood and thatch buildings, and wattle fences. An incongruous metal
pillar stands nearby. )  
GLITZ: The light converter.  
DIBBER: Let me blast it, Mister Glitz, then we can get away from here.  
GLITZ: Oh, you'd look good with a back full of spears, Dibber. Use your head.  
(They are escorted towards the largest hut. A mature, well built woman strides
out to meet them. Everyone say Hi! to the redoubtable Joan Sims.)  
GLITZ: Anyway, we've got company. Right royal company, by the looks of things.  
DIBBER: You'll never charm her.  
GLITZ: I have an uncanny knack with aging females, Dibber. One look into my
eyes and they start to melt.

**[Marb Station]**

(The Doctor strolls through well-lit metal tunnels into a large metal lined
chamber. Up steep flights of stairs are closed three cubicles. By the steps
are glass flasks on pedestals. The Doctor picks one up to sniff its contents.)  
COMPUTER: Water thief. Water thief. Protect your water.  
(The cubicle doors slide down and two men in yellow coveralls and grey hoods
rush out from them brandishing wooden clubs.)  
DOCTOR: Perhaps you could direct me to the stationmaster's house? Now please,
gentlemen.  
(The Doctor is surrounded by raised clubs.)

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

(A man in black appears on a screen.)  
MERDEEN [on screen]: Yes, Immortal?  
(A non-human voice answers him. We do not see the speaker.)  
DRATHRO: Marb station shows one work unit over strength. Remove it!  
MERDEEN: Immediately, Immortal.  
(Merdeen leaves and the screen goes blank. We now see that the speaker was a
robot with a head like a radar scanner.)

**[Control room]**

(Merdeen turns to a man in a crash helmet working a computer terminal.)  
MERDEEN: Call the Watch. Marb is a work unit over.  
GRELL: How?  
MERDEEN: I don't know, but the Immortal is never wrong, Grell.  
GRELL: I'll summon the watch.

**[Village]**

(The Matriarch is settled in her throne by her hut.)  
KATRYCA: So, you are outlanders. From where?  
GLITZ: A far off star, majesty.  
KATRYCA: You have a spaceship?  
GLITZ: You know of such things?  
KATRYCA: It is recorded in our folk memory. Before the fire, our ancestors
travelled among the stars.  
GLITZ: Is that a fact?  
KATRYCA: It is also recorded that such travel angered the gods, who punished
us by sending the great fire which destroyed our planet.  
GLITZ: No, dear lady. It was much more secular than that. That attracted the
fireball.  
KATRYCA: That is our great totem to the Earth God Haldren.  
GLITZ: No, madam. That is a malfunctioning navigational beacon. It was that
that attracted the fireball five hundred years ago, and I'm here to tell you
that it is still malfunctioning today.  
KATRYCA: How do you know this?  
GLITZ: It is my job to know. And if you don't have it dismantled, the fireball
will return.  
KATRYCA: What is your name?  
GLITZ: Sabalom Glitz.  
KATRYCA: I am an old woman, Sabalom Glitz. You are not the first to visit my
village from another world.  
GLITZ: Is that a fact?  
KATRYCA: On each and every occasion, they have all wanted to dismantle the
great totem.  
GLITZ: In that case, you understand the urgency  
KATRYCA: And on each and every occasion, they have all had a different reason.  
GLITZ: Let me assure you, my credentials are bona fide and completely in
order.  
(Glitz draws his gun. He is swiftly disarmed by a large man with a large head
of brown hair. Men hold Dibber and Glitz by the arms.)  
KATRYCA: Ah yes, The guns. They all had similar credentials.  
GLITZ: That totem is a navigational hazard. It must be dismantled.  
KATRYCA: You must think me a fool! You have come here for no other reason but
to steal the symbol of our great god.  
GLITZ: And what would I want with some earth grubbing deity.  
KATRYCA: I don't know. But before you die, I shall certainly find out.

**[Marb Station]**

(The Doctor is unconscious and fastened to a pillar with chains. He wakes.)  
BALAZAR: Where are you from, Old One?  
DOCTOR: Old One?  
BALAZAR: What station did you disgrace with your miserable presence, water
thief?  
DOCTOR: I may look old to you, whiskerless youth, but I'll have you know I'm
in the prime of my life. I'm only nine hundred years old. Now untie me at
once.  
BALAZAR: You'll be untied as soon as we're ready for the stoning.  
DOCTOR: Stoning? Is this the way you welcome visitors?  
BALAZAR: Water is life. Those who steal life must in their turn die. The
Immortal commands it.  
DOCTOR: Oh, the Immortal. Who might that be?  
BALAZAR: Come now, Old One. Feigning ignorance of the Immortal will not save
you from death.

**[Village]**

(Katryca hefts Glitz's gun.)  
KATRYCA: This is what I've been waiting for. Now, Immortal, I am ready for
you.

**[Marb Station]**

_BALAZAR: We shall soon be ready.  
DOCTOR: Oh, goody. _Just who are you?  
BALAZAR: I am Balazar, the reader of the books.  
DOCTOR: Oh. And what books are those?  
BALAZAR: Ancient books, from the world before the fire. They contain much
wisdom for those who can interpret their meaning. Here in Marb, we have three.  
DOCTOR: Three? Splendid. What are they called?  
BALAZAR: The Books of Knowledge.  
DOCTOR: No, but each book must have a name, Balazar. It's usually written on
the front.  
BALAZAR: One of our books is called Mo By Dick by Herman Melville. It tells of
a great white water god, and contains many mystical passages.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I've read it. What are the other books?  
BALAZAR: How can you have read it, Old One? The sacred books belong to Marb.  
DOCTOR: Will you stop calling me Old One? I am known as the Doctor. What else
do you read?  
BALAZAR: The Water Babies by Charles Kingsley, which tells of life long before
the fire.  
DOCTOR: Sounds a rum sort of library to me. What's your third book?  
BALAZAR: Most mysterious of all the sacred texts. UK Habitats of the Canadian
Goose by HM Stationery Office.  
DOCTOR: Hmm. What do you call this place?  
BALAZAR: Marb Station.  
DOCTOR: No, I mean your whole world, everything.  
BALAZAR: We call it UK Habitat. _Ah. It appears we're ready for the stoning
now, Doctor. I have greatly enjoyed our felicitous discourse, but alas, the
end is nigh.  
DOCTOR: You said you'd unchain me, Balazar.  
BALAZAR: It is not advisable. I have taken an affection to you. It is best to
die quickly.  
DOCTOR: Allow me to be the judge of that. Unchain me at once._

**[Hut]**

(Dibber watches through the planks in the door as Peri is brought into the
village.)  
DIBBER: They've got that woman we saw earlier.  
GLITZ: I can't understand it, Dibber. They're savages.  
DIBBER: Well, don't let it get you down.  
GLITZ: What went wrong? That old hag took our guns away from us just like
that. How can we be their prisoners?  
DIBBER: I told you it was risky coming here.  
GLITZ: Yes, well, now you know what I mean about competition. It gets you
nowhere.  
DIBBER: I told you we should have blasted them, Mister Glitz.  
GLITZ: Yes, Dibber, you've made your point. _It's a pity you didn't anticipate
they'd jump us with such ease.  
DIBBER: I did, but I didn't think you'd listen. _

**[Marb Station]**

(The Doctor has been unchained. The rest of the men are holding large stones
in their hands.)  
BALAZAR: I think it best that you stand over here.  
DOCTOR: Oh, why?  
BALAZAR: Well in case some stray stone breaks the water jugs.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes.  
BALAZAR: People get very excited at these stonings.  
(Balazar gives the Doctor his umbrella and walks away.)  
DOCTOR: I'm not excited.  
BALAZAR: Ready?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
BALAZAR: Get set. Go!  
(The Doctor unfurls his umbrella but still gets hit by one stone. He falls and
the men cheer.)

**[** **Trial room]**

DOCTOR: Oh! Why'd you stop it at the best bit? I was rather enjoying that.  
VALEYARD: I'm sure you were.  
DOCTOR: Clever, eh? That trick with the umbrella.  
VALEYARD: Most ingenious, my dear Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I always like to do the unexpected. Takes people by surprise.  
VALEYARD: Hear how the Doctor takes pride in his interference. Hear how he
boasts. This is not the reaction of a responsible Time Lord.  
INQUISITOR: We are all aware of that, Valeyard. What is the point you are
trying to make?  
VALEYARD: These proceedings started as a mere enquiry into the Doctor's
activities. I'm suggesting now that it becomes a trial. And if he is found
guilty, I strongly suggest the termination of his life!

__**Part Two**__

**[** **Trial room]**

DOCTOR: So, you want me dead, eh?  
INQUISITOR: What the Valeyard wants and what the court decides, are two
entirely different things, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Thank you, my lady.  
INQUISITOR: Proceed Valeyard.

**[Marb station]**

(The stoning crowd is cheering.)  
BALAZAR: Train guards!  
(A small vehicle arrives towing a unit that can seat six. Merdeen and three
guards are on it.)  
COMPUTER: This station is a work unit over committed strength. There must be a
cull.  
BALAZAR: It has been dealt with.  
MERDEEN: See that he is dead, Grell. Where is he from?  
BALAZAR: I don't know. He told many lies, even that he had read our sacred
books.  
GRELL: He still breathes.  
MERDEEN: Then kill him.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

DRATHRO: Stop!

**[Marb station]**

(Only Merdeen can hear the robot through his helmet radio.)  
MERDEEN: Wait, the Immortal speaks. He now wishes to question the stranger.
How near death is he?  
GRELL: Merely stunned.  
MERDEEN: Pick him up. Grell, patrol.  
GRELL: Why not transport him on the train?  
MERDEEN: I said patrol. (to Balazar) You, come with me.  
BALAZAR: I, sir?  
MERDEEN: You have spoken with the stranger. If he dies, the Immortal may wish
to question you about him. (Merdeen and Balazar leave, followed by two guards
carrying the Doctor.)

**[Katryca's hut]**

(Peri is brought in and dropped in front of Katryca's throne.)  
PERI: Oh!  
KATRYCA: Welcome, girl.  
PERI: Hi.  
KATRYCA: Rise. You are not from the place of the underground. Where are you
from?  
PERI: Well, it's kind of difficult to explain.  
KATRYCA: My name is Katryca, I am the leader of the Free. Do you have a name,
girl?  
PERI: Perpugilliam Brown, but my friends call me Peri.  
KATRYCA: Peri. Not many girls join the Free, Peri. I shall provide some
excellent husbands for you.  
PERI: Husbands? Plural?  
KATRYCA: Such women as we have must be shared. Think about it. Put her with
the other prisoners. Keep them guarded.  
PERI: All right, all right. I can walk.

**[Subway]**

BALAZAR: Tell me, Merdeen, you served the Immortal. Is he as men say?  
MERDEEN: What do men say?  
BALAZAR: That he is taller than two, with arms of steel.  
MERDEEN: The Immortal is never seen. He stays in his castle.  
BALAZAR: Then how does he give you his commands?  
MERDEEN: He talks to me through the air and he watches me with boxes.  
(Merdeen points to a CCTV camera up on the wall.)  
BALAZAR: I think this is called a camera, Merdeen. The men of ancient times
used such things to make pictures of the Canadian goose.  
MERDEEN: How do you know that, Balazar?  
BALAZAR: It is my task to study the ancient texts.  
DOCTOR: About which you continually boast. That's the trouble with pallid
little swats like you, Balazar, You can't even organise an efficient stoning.  
BALAZAR: It was only half over.  
DOCTOR: Oh.  
BALAZAR: You'd have been free of your troubles now if Merdeen and his train
guards had not saved you.  
DOCTOR: Then I'm grateful to you, Merdeen.  
MERDEEN: It was on the orders of the Immortal.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, please convey my thanks to him. Is that water? Could I have
some?  
MERDEEN: It's my ration for the next two days.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

DRATHRO: Give it to him.  
MERDEEN [on screen]: What?  
DRATHRO: Give it to him.  
MERDEEN: Oh. Yes, of course.  
DOCTOR: No, of course not. I'd forgotten how important that stuff was down
here.  
(The Doctor goes up to the camera.)  
DOCTOR: Mono-optic system, eh? Very interesting. And is the, er, Immortal on
the other end of that?  
(The screen goes blank. A pair of pallid blond men look at each other.)  
TANDRELL: Extremely ugly.  
HUMKER: Hideous in the extreme.  
DRATHRO: Physiognomy is irrelevant.  
TANDRELL: In so far as  
HUMKER: Appearance has no function.  
TANDRELL: But function has an appearance.  
HUMKER: Which is irrelevant to the function.  
TANDRELL: Perfect.  
HUMKER: I must write that down.  
TANDRELL: I will make an equation of it.  
DRATHRO: Cease your prattle.  
HUMKER: Of course, sir.  
TANDRELL: At once, sir.  
DRATHRO: Activate the service robot. Now!

**[Hut]**

(Peri is pushed inside.)  
GLITZ: Ah, it seems we have a pretty visitor. I'm beginning to feel better
already. Sabalom Glitz, my dear, and this youth with the vacuous expression
and single track mind is Dibber.  
PERI: Peri.  
GLITZ: Ah.  
(They shake hands.)  
PERI: Well, obviously you're not from round here.  
GLITZ: Merely visiting, like good yourself.  
PERI: Well, I hope my visit's very short. That doesn't look like it's from
round here either.  
GLITZ: It's a light converter.  
PERI: A what?  
DIBBER: It funnels black light energy down to the L3. That's why we have to
knock it out.  
GLITZ: Dibber! I'm sure Peri isn't interested in professional matters.  
DIBBER: Oh, you're right, Mister Glitz, yeah.  
GLITZ: When we first saw you, Peri, you were not alone.  
DIBBER: That's right, you were with a dilly in a long coat. But he disappeared
down the tunnel before we  
GLITZ: Before we could leap forward and make your acquaintance, eh, Dibber?  
DIBBER: Yeah, that's it.  
GLITZ: Where is your friend now?  
PERI: The Doctor? Oh, he's probably still down there. For a Time Lord, he's
not very good at keeping time.  
GLITZ: The Doctor is a Time Lord? So that's how he knew where to go.  
PERI: What do you mean?  
DIBBER: Sent him, did they?  
PERI: Who?  
GLITZ: The Time Lords, my dear. As my friend says, he must be acting on their
behalf.  
PERI: I don't think the Doctor's acting on anyone's behalf.  
GLITZ: So, he's a freelance like myself. Possibly we can reach an
accommodation here, my boy. Two rogues with but a single thought.

**[Subway]**

DOCTOR: And how long has the Immortal lived in his so-called, castle?  
MERDEEN: Since the fire.  
DOCTOR: Oh, five hundred years?  
BALAZAR: I do not know, Doctor. He was sent to save our lives many centuries
ago.  
DOCTOR: Hmm. And he never goes out and nobody ever comes in?  
BALAZAR: Only the young men who pass the selection.  
DOCTOR: What selection?  
BALAZAR: To find the two cleverest youths. They go to the castle.  
DOCTOR: Why?  
BALAZAR: It is said the Immortal eats them.  
DOCTOR: Never believe what is said, Balazar, only what you know.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

(A very functional non-humanoid robot is released into Marb station.)  
HUMKER: Why are we doing this?  
TANDRELL: Because sir ordered it.  
HUMKER: Yes, but  
DRATHRO: It may be needed.

**[Hut]**

DIBBER: These bars remind me of home. I reckon I could bite me way through
them.  
GLITZ: Relax Dibber. I'll find a way to win the confidence of these simple
peasants.  
PERI: Well, I'll like to get out of here. Katryca said something about
choosing husbands for me.  
GLITZ: There you are. Obviously she's a romantic at heart.  
PERI: Well, so am I, but not romantic enough to want more that one husband.  
DIBBER: Where we come from, a woman can have as many as six.  
PERI: Oh, it's very similar on my planet, except we usually have them one at a
time.  
GLITZ: I should like to stand in paterfamilias for your absent father and give
you away, my dear, but I always cry at these moments of deep sentiment.  
DIBBER: I think we should help her get out.  
GLITZ: No, no, dear boy. We may need these brutish primitives.  
PERI: What for?  
(Glitz unfolds a map.)  
GLITZ: This shows a layout of the tunnel system, all hermetically sealed. If
we can persuade Katryca's people to drive a shaft into the centre, we can fill
them with gas.  
PERI: You'd kill them? The people Katryca calls underground dwellers? That
would be mass murder.  
GLITZ: I'm sure my conscience will prick a little, but where money is
concerned, that doesn't usually last long.  
PERI: Oh, you can't do it.  
GLITZ: I think it will be pretty simple. Don't forget, this is a high risk
business venture, Peri. The people down there take the risk, I take the
profit.  
DIBBER: That still leaves the L3.  
GLITZ: And what chance would the robot will have without a labour force? It'll
probably be quicker than trying to destroy its black light supply.  
(The big man enters.)  
BROKEN TOOTH: Come with me.

**[Subway]**

(Merdeen stops at a metal door next to some steps very like those on the space
station where the Tardis landed.)  
MERDEEN: You enter here, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Ah. No need to knock, I imagine.  
BALAZAR: Will I be needed?  
MERDEEN: No.  
DOCTOR: Lucky old you.  
MERDEEN: When you are in the Immortal's presence you will cast your eyes to
the ground.  
DOCTOR: Will I?  
MERDEEN: It is forbidden to look upon him.  
DOCTOR: On pain of being turned into a pillar of salt, I imagine. That sort of
thing?  
MERDEEN: You will not find it wise to mock the Immortal. Doubtless your body
will be returned to me before this day is out.  
DOCTOR: Oh, Merdeen, why don't you just push off and guard some trains, eh?  
(The Doctor pushes open the double doors and looks through carefully before
entering and closing them behind him. Merdeen, Balazar and the guards leave,
then the service robot comes out of an alcove.)

**[Katryca's hut]**

GLITZ: Ah, dear lady. I knew once you'd had time to consider  
KATRYCA: Be silent, fat one. I have studied the fires and there is anger in
them.  
PERI: Anger?  
KATRYCA: You have travelled from beyond the stars. Your intention, to steal
our great totem. Only a sacrifice in the flames will propitiate the gods.  
DIBBER: All of us?  
KATRYCA: No. Only you are the chosen one, Sabalom Glitz.  
GLITZ: Me? Are you insane? I'm wanted in six different galaxies for crimes you
couldn't even imagine. Do you think an old hag like you can bring me down?  
KATRYCA: The pyre is being built. You will be brought when your time is due.

**[Outside Drathro's 'castle']**

(The Doctor goes up to the camera by the door opposite the entrance.)  
DOCTOR: Er, this is my best side.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

HUMKER: The arrogance.  
TANDRELL: Can't wait to see how he's been programmed.  
(The Doctor pushes open the double doors and enters.)  
DRATHRO: I have been waiting for this day. Welcome at last.  
DOCTOR: You were expecting me?  
DRATHRO: For centuries. I am Drathro, an L3 robot.  
(Humker and Tandrell take various items from the Doctor's pockets.)  
DOCTOR: Then I fear you are under a slight misapprehension, Drathro. I only
decided to come here yesterday.  
DRATHRO: You are not from Andromeda? Then where are you from?  
DOCTOR: Gallifrey, originally, though I travel round a lot.  
DRATHRO: I have heard of Gallifrey. An advanced civilisation.  
DOCTOR: In some ways.  
DRATHRO: I apologize for my error.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's all right. Even Immortals make the odd mistake every few
millennia.  
(The Doctor snatches back his little teddy bear and bag of jelly babies.)  
DRATHRO: I am not immortal.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, the locals round here seem to think you are.  
DRATHRO: These are my assistants, Tandrell and Humker. You will work with
them.  
(The Doctor offers the men a jelly baby.)  
DOCTOR: Will I? Why?  
DRATHRO: Because I command it.  
DOCTOR: Oh. And you are obviously a robot used to getting your own way.  
HUMKER: This is remarkable, Drathro.  
TANDRELL: Most impressive.  
HUMKER: Even the texture has an organic warmth.  
DOCTOR; Do stop prodding me, there's a good fellow.  
DRATHRO: The Doctor is not a robot. He is an organic from an advanced
civilisation.  
TANDRELL: An organic?  
HUMKER: We've not met an organic since we passed the selection.  
DOCTOR: Ah. I knew you two hadn't ended up for lunch.  
TANDRELL: Explain.  
DOCTOR: Never mind. What is this work you want me to do?

**[** **Trial room]**

INQUISITOR: Is this relevant testimony, Valeyard? We seem to be straying from
the point.  
VALEYARD: Circumstantially germane, my lady, in that it is part of the
prosecution's case is that the Doctor introduces a disruptive and corrupting
influence wherever he goes.  
DOCTOR: Sheer poppycock.  
VALEYARD: If the Doctor had not visited Ravalox, then the whole chain of
events we are witnessing would not have been set in motion.  
DOCTOR: Well, how can the Boatyard make that claim? What might or might not
have happened is entirely speculative.  
INQUISITOR: That is for me to decide, Doctor. And may I remind you, the charge
you face is grave indeed.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I only have to look at the Graveyard to see that, ma'am.  
INQUISITOR: You're puerile attempts at flippancy are not appreciated in this
court, Doctor. Proceed, Valeyard.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

DRATHRO: Have you found the fault yet?  
DOCTOR: Hmm? Give me a chance. I've only just started.  
DRATHRO: The black light system is indicating incipient failure.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, I can see that, but they don't last forever, you know.  
DRATHRO: I am trained only in installation and maintenance.  
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, yeah, and very useful too. That's where the money is.  
DRATHRO: I have trained these humans to study the problem, but they make no
progress.  
DOCTOR: Well, black light is very tricky stuff, Drathro.  
DRATHRO: I have a learning capacity but my processors of ratiocination are
logical. Organics often eliminate such steps.  
DOCTOR: It's called intuition.  
DRATHRO: Your first task will be to restructure the system.  
DOCTOR: Well, just a minute. Black light is not my field.  
DRATHRO: Then you will make it so, or die!

**[** **Trial room]**

DOCTOR: I protest!  
INQUISITOR: What now?  
DOCTOR: Yes, now!  
INQUISITOR: I meant, what are you protesting about this time?  
DOCTOR: I am charged with interfering, yet it's blatantly obvious to a blind
speelsnape that I am working under duress.  
INQUISITOR: That does seem a valid point. What is the relevance of your
presentation?  
VALEYARD: If the accused hadn't interrupted, my lady, the point I wish to make
would have become obvious.  
DOCTOR: Oh, then I apologise for my outburst. As your ladyship is aware, I am
unfamiliar, unlike the Valeyard, with court procedure.  
INQUISITOR: The court accepts your apology, Doctor. Proceed.

**[Village]**

(Glitz, Peri and Dibber are watching the villagers put wood round the bottom
of a stake.)  
DIBBER: What a terrible waste.  
GLITZ: You're telling me.  
DIBBER: No, I meant the wood. Now, if I was handling this execution I'd go to
a bullet in the back of the head. Much more economical.  
PERI: He has a point.  
GLITZ: Of all the sniveling screeves to be stuck with in my moment of need, I
have to get you two.  
DIBBER: I know. Depressing, isn't it.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry, Drathro. There's not a lot I can do down here.  
DRATHRO: I order you to work.  
DOCTOR: Well, you can play at being the slave driver all you like, but the
fault doesn't lie down here. There must be a collection aerial out on the
surface which is malfunctioning. I'll, I'll just pop up and have a look at it.  
DRATHRO: You will remain here and proceed with your appointed task.  
DOCTOR: I think you must have fluff in your audio circuit. What's all this
stuff for, anyway?  
TANDRELL: It provides Drathro with his energy source.  
HUMKER: It was also to maintain the three Sleepers until they could be
returned to Andromeda.  
DOCTOR: The three Sleepers?  
DRATHRO: They are dead now. The relief ships failed to arrive.  
DOCTOR: I see. Well, if this power failure's allowed to get any worse, we'll
all be dead soon.  
HUMKER: Why?  
DOCTOR: Because there will be an enormous explosion. Now I can't impress upon
you how urgent it is I go up and look at that converter's aerial.  
DRATHRO: A transparent ruse to escape. Get on with the work.  
DOCTOR: Oh, how do you put up with him.  
(The Doctor takes the metal sphere that Hunker is tapping out of his hands.)  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Tell me, why is water so important down here?  
HUMKER: The condensation plants produce only enough for five hundred work
units.  
DOCTOR: But it was raining buckets outside, or it was when I arrived.  
DRATHRO: I am aware that precipitation has returned to normal.  
DOCTOR: Then why don't you let everyone just pop up and help themselves?  
DRATHRO: My instructions were to maintain an underground survival system.  
DOCTOR: Inflexible little fellow aren't you? Here, hold that.  
(The Doctor holds out a circuit board to Drathro.)  
DOCTOR: Well, come on. Aren't you supposed to be programmed to be user
friendly or something? Times like this one need three hands you know. We
bipeds are a very inefficient design. You, Humbug, whatever your name is, hold
that.  
(He gives a circuit board to Humker.)  
DOCTOR: And you, Handbag, finger on the end there. That's it, yes. Well done,
splendid, yes. Well, that should just about do it.  
(The Doctor throws a switch and retreats as electricity zaps Drathro, Humker
and Tandrell.)

**[Outside Central control]**

(The service robot blocks his way.)  
DOCTOR: Ah. Look!  
(The robot turns to where the Doctor is pointing, and he runs round its back.
Humker manages to turn off the electricity. Drathro calls to the robot.)  
DRATHRO: Follow him. Use your tracer disc. He must be brought back unharmed.

**[Village]**

(Glitz, Peri and Dibber are being escorted up a slope.)  
GLITZ: Ready?  
(Peri dashes forward, and Dibber and Glitz take out their escorts.)  
GLITZ: Well done Dibber. Take this. Always keep something up your sleeve, eh,
Dibber?  
(Glitz gives Dibber a small bomb.)  
GLITZ: I want you to conceal yourself in some muddy crevice while Peri and I
lead off the hunt.  
PERI: What hunt?  
GLITZ: Oh, there'll be one soon. As soon as you get the chance I want you to
blow that light converter to bits.  
DIBBER: And where do we meet up?  
GLITZ: The entrance to the tunnel. Come on, Peri.

**[Katryca's hut]**

(Katryca is examining Glitz' rifle.)  
BROKEN TOOTH: Majesty!  
KATRYCA: How dare you!  
BROKEN TOOTH: Forgive me, but the prisoners have escaped.  
KATRYCA: Take this.  
(She throws him the weapon.)  
KATRYCA: Lead the young men on a hunting party. They must not escape!

**[Subway]**

DRATHRO [OC]: The Doctor has absconded. Hw must be found.  
MERDEEN: Yes, Immortal.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

HUMKER: He should be killed.  
TANDRELL: Very slowly. He hurt me. I hate being hurt.  
HUMKER: He hurt me more.  
TANDRELL: A subjective judgement.  
DRATHRO: He must not be killed. I still need him.

**[Marb station]**

(As the service robot makes its way through the corridors, Merdeen instructs
his guards.)  
MERDEEN: Search area green. Area red.  
(Balazar and Merdeen go in the opposite direction, then Merdeen stops and
covers the microphone on his helmet.)  
MERDEEN: Quiet.  
BALAZAR: Should we not search for the Doctor?  
MERDEEN: I said quiet. Listen to me carefully. You are a clever man.  
BALAZAR: I am the Reader.  
MERDEEN: People like you are needed on the surface. I will direct you there.  
BALAZAR: The surface? But nothing lives there. The fire  
MERDEEN: I said listen. There is no fire. There has been no fire for hundreds
of years. It is the only place you will be beyond the Immortal's reach. Do you
understand me?  
BALAZAR: Well, what shall I do, Merdeen? How will I live?  
MERDEEN: You will find others out there. Many I have saved from the Immortal.  
BALAZAR: If the Immortal discovers this, you will die. Why do you risk your
life, Merdeen?  
MERDEEN: I am sick of the cullings. But I have to be careful. I think Grell
already suspects.  
BALAZAR: But what will you do?  
MERDEEN: Find the Doctor and send him to you.  
(Grell watches them leave.)

**[Ravalox]**

(Peri leads Glitz through the trees.)  
PERI: Come on!  
(Dibber drops the bomb at the base of the light converter then runs and dives
into a ditch. KaBOOM! The light converter topples over.)

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

(Electrical discharges are playing over a wall panel. Drathro is swaying and
having difficulty in speaking.)  
DRATHRO: What is happening.?

**[Ravalox]**

(Broken Tooth picks up the fugitive's trail in the leaf litter.)  
BROKEN TOOTH: This way.

**[Subway]**

(The Doctor runs into Merdeen and Balazar.)  
DOCTOR: Whoops!  
MERDEEN: Wait, Doctor. We mean you no harm.  
DOCTOR: You did the last time we met.  
BALAZAR: Things have changed.  
DOCTOR: Then let me pass. I have to get out of here.  
MERDEEN: Take Balazar with you.  
DOCTOR: Er, yes, all right.  
BALAZAR: What will you do?  
MERDEEN: I must stay and help others.  
DOCTOR: I should be careful if I was you. There's a robot following me who
isn't in a very friendly mood.  
MERDEEN: Would you help us, Doctor, to crush the Immortal's power?  
DOCTOR: Er, yes, er, perhaps. But there's something I've got to do much more
important first. Come along, Balazar.

**[** **Trial room]**

VALEYARD: Stop! This is another prime example of the Doctor's interference.
You will note that he was in a position to free himself of the situation, yet
deliberately chose not to.  
DOCTOR: I was trying to help. Surely even a blockhead like you can see that.  
INQUISITOR: I think we should reserve judgement until the end of the sequence.  
DOCTOR: I agree, my lady.

**[Tunnel entrance]**

(Dibber is running for his life with the villagers hot on his heels when the
Doctor leads Balazar out into the fresh air.)  
BALAZAR: It's beautiful!  
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh. Oh, I knew she wouldn't still be here. That girl can't obey
an order.  
(Peri and Glitz come running.)  
PERI: Doctor!  
BALAZAR: Who are they?  
DOCTOR: Peri! Hurry!  
(Dibber is also approaching, followed by villagers.)  
DOCTOR: Back inside, quick.  
(Balazar goes into the tunnel. Peri and Glitz arrive.)  
DOCTOR: In you go.  
(Finally Dibber.)  
DOCTOR: Come on!

**[Tunnel]**

GLITZ: I always knew exercise was bad for you.  
DOCTOR: I shouldn't lie there if I was you. Not unless you want to be killed
with a spear in your back.  
GLITZ: What? Did you do the job, my boy?  
DIBBER: Of course.

**[Underground station]**

DOCTOR: We've got to get out of here!  
PERI: But how?  
DOCTOR: This way.  
(The service robot is on the platform.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, no. Back.  
(The villagers are coming down the escalator.)  
PERI: Well, now what?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. I really think this could be the end!

__**Part Three**__

**[Underground station]**

(Broken Tooth fires the gun, and everyone ducks. The shots hit the wall by
Glitz's head.)  
BALAZAR: I know him. It's Broken Tooth.  
GLITZ: Then why doesn't he fire at you?  
BALAZAR: Broken Tooth, it's Balazar!  
DOCTOR: Fire at the robot!  
BALAZAR: The Immortal One.  
DIBBER: Squeeze the trigger, don't pull it.  
(Broken Tooth takes careful aim.)

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

(The image relayed from the service robot goes off.)  
DRATHRO: What is happening? Reactivate!  
HUMKER: We are trying.  
TANDRELL: It doesn't respond.  
DRATHRO: You must make it work. I must have the Doctor here. My black light
system is failing.

**[Underground station]**

(The Doctor examines the broken service robot.)  
BALAZAR: I can't believe it. You're alive! They said you'd been culled.  
BROKEN TOOTH: I owe my life to Merdeen.  
BALAZAR: I too.  
DOCTOR: Well, I hate to break up this happy reunion, but I have to find the
aerial to Drathro's black light converter.  
DIBBER: No need to hurry. It's gone.  
DOCTOR: Gone? Where?  
DIBBER: I blew it up.  
DOCTOR: What?  
GLITZ: It'll put the L3 out of action.  
DOCTOR: More likely start a chain reaction. Drathro's black light system's
highly unstable. Blowing it up is about the worst thing you could have done. I
have to shut the black light system down now.  
BROKEN TOOTH: You will all return to our village. Our queen has unfinished
business with this person.  
DOCTOR: No!  
BROKEN TOOTH: You will come with us, and you will come quietly.  
GLITZ: And you had to tell him how to use the gun.  
DIBBER: Oh.

**[** **Trial room]**

INQUISITOR: Valeyard, are these unpleasant scenes necessary to your case? I
find primitive physical violence distressing.  
DOCTOR: So do I, ma'am. Especially when I'm on the receiving end.  
VALEYARD: I too find it repugnant to witness, my lady, but the Doctor has a
well-known predilection for violence.  
DOCTOR: That is a foul slur!  
INQUISITOR: Do not interrupt, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm not given to violence as the Valeyard here
suggests. Occasionally I might have to resort to a modicum of force  
INQUISITOR: Please be silent.  
DOCTOR: As a means of self defence.  
INQUISITOR: Doctor, you will have ample opportunity to put your case at a
later point.  
DOCTOR: But  
INQUISITOR: Valeyard, I would appreciate it if these brutal and repetitious
scenes are reduced to a minimum.  
VALEYARD: My lady, it is certainly not my wish to cause you any unnecessary
affront, but the accused offences are such that a certain amount of graphic
detail is unavoidable.  
INQUISITOR: Very well. Continue.

**[Subway]**

(As the Doctor and company are escorted through the woods, and the Doctor
picks up something to show to Peri, Merdeen is walking along a corridor when
Grell steps out behind him with a crossbow pointed at his back.)  
GRELL: You seem lost.  
MERDEEN: Not I, although you seem to have mislaid your train, Grell.  
GRELL: Stealth is better achieved on foot. Especially when we hunt dark
secrets.  
MERDEEN: I thought we hunted the Doctor.  
GRELL: Him too.  
DRATHRO [OC]: Merdeen.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

MERDEEN [on screen]: Immortal?  
DRATHRO: I have urgent work for Balazar, but I can not find him.

**[Subway]**

MERDEEN: I will search for him at once.  
GRELL: Where are you going?  
MERDEEN: Continue your search for the Doctor.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

(The service robot comes back to life and heads for the escalator stairs.)  
TANDRELL: I did it! I did it, I reactivated the robot.  
HUMKER: I think you'll find that I did it.  
TANDRELL: I beg your pardon, I did it.  
HUMKER: I did it.  
TANDRELL: I did!  
HUMKER: I did!  
DRATHRO: Silence! You drain my energy reserve with your constant infantile
bickering.

**[Katryca's hut]**

(Broken Tooth leads the party in, and bows to his queen before going to
whisper in her ear then taking his place behind her.)  
KATRYCA: So, my hospitality was not to your liking?  
GLITZ: Just needed to step out for a breath of fresh air.  
KATRYCA: And who is this?  
DOCTOR: Ah, how do you do? I am known as the Doctor. Now, there has been a
terrible mistake. I shouldn't be here at all.  
KATRYCA: Another star traveller?  
DOCTOR: Well, in a manner of speaking.  
KATRYCA: And are you interested in the Great Totem of Haldren.  
DOCTOR: I beg your pardon?  
GLITZ: She means the light converter.  
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, indeed. Now how can you possibly have known that?  
KATRYCA: Have you searched him for guns?  
BROKEN TOOTH: He has none.  
KATRYCA: That makes you very unusual for a star traveller who is interested in
the Great Totem.  
DOCTOR: Well, I've come to repair it.  
KATRYCA: Then you are very prompt, considering your friends have only recently
damaged it.  
DOCTOR: Oh, these are not my friends. Well, with one  
(The Doctor puts his arm round Peri.)  
DOCTOR: And your Great Totem is not what it seems.  
KATRYCA: Then please explain.  
DOCTOR: It's function is to convert ultraviolet rays to black light.  
KATRYCA: Interesting, though I do not understand what you are saying.  
DOCTOR: Well, Drathro, er, the Immortal, depends on black light to function.
He is a robot.  
KATRYCA: Fascinating, since your friend just told me that it was a
navigational beacon.  
DOCTOR: He lies.  
KATRYCA: A common complaint among star travellers.  
GLITZ: I am not a liar!  
KATRYCA: How shall I know who speaks the truth? All I am certain of is the
gods are angered at your coming to our world. I shall read their wishes in the
flames.  
DOCTOR: Er, I don't wish to appear discourteous, but I'd better get back to
Drathro.  
KATRYCA: Remain where you are!  
DOCTOR: You have no quarrel with us. They destroyed your beacon.  
KATRYCA: You are a star traveller. Star travelling is forbidden by the gods.
The underground dweller shall remain with our tribe. The others, remove from
my sight.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

(The service robot is making its way through the woods.)  
HUMKER: All that unpleasant green.  
TANDRELL: It is vegetation.  
HUMKER: Why was it not burned, Drathro?  
DRATHRO: Only part of the planet was enveloped by fire.  
HUMKER: What is its function?  
DRATHRO: It supports primitive life.  
TANDRELL: Primitive life is unnecessary.  
HUMKER: So vegetation in unnecessary.  
TANDRELL: Syllogism is also unnecessary, Humker.  
HUMKER: It was not a true syllogism, Tandrell. It contained only the major and
minor premise.  
TANDRELL: Still unnecessary, like so much that you say.

**[Hut]**

(The service robot enters the village, miraculously unnoticed, while the
Doctor, Dibber, Glitz, Peri and Balazar are shown into the prison hut by
Broken Tooth.)  
DIBBER: Thought we'd seen the last of this place.  
DOCTOR: Look, you've got to help us get out of here.  
BALAZAR: I dare not, Doctor.  
BROKEN TOOTH: The queen will burn us in your place.  
DOCTOR: If I don't get out of here, we'll all burn.  
GLITZ: You're the Time Lord. Haven't you got a ring you can rub? A magic lamp?
Something for these sort of emergencies?  
DOCTOR: Hardly. More your style I'd have thought. Anyway, what does bring you
here?  
GLITZ: Purely a private enterprise, Doctor, to collect a few moldering files
of no value except to scholars such as myself.  
DOCTOR: Oh, you're a scholarly philanthropist, are you?  
GLITZ: Exactly the description, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: That goes around blowing up black light converters.  
GLITZ: A small expediency if I am to endow a library on my home planet of
Salostophus.  
DOCTOR: In the constellation of Andromeda?  
GLITZ: You know of it?  
DOCTOR: Hmm.  
PERI: What we don't know is the name of this planet.  
GLITZ: You mean he hasn't told you? A man of your learning, Doctor? Tut tut.
This, is Earth of course.  
PERI: I said so, didn't I?  
DOCTOR: But it is in the wrong position.  
GLITZ: Only by a couple of light years.  
DIBBER: That's why the lost expedition missed.  
DOCTOR: What lost expedition?  
DIBBER: Andromeda bunged off these robots in a relief ship  
GLITZ: Don't prattle, Dibber. All that was a long time ago.  
BALAZAR: The word Earth is mentioned many times, by the great writer H M
Stationery Office.  
(There is a whirring noise then the service robot crashes through the hut
wall.)  
DIBBER: Thought we'd seen the last of him as well.  
GLITZ: Shut up and stand in front of me where I can keep an eye on you.  
(The service robot scans the area.)  
DOCTOR: Keep calm and stay still. It's looking for me, but I think it's
confused.  
GLITZ: Well, can't you shake its hand or something?  
DOCTOR: How do you do? I am known as the Doctor.  
(The Doctor takes hold of a small protuberance and gets flung against the
wall. He winces. Then the robot sends out flexible cables to lasso the
Doctor's legs and pulls him onto its body for transportation.)  
GLITZ: Now's our chance, Dibber.  
PERI: We've got to help the Doctor!  
GLITZ: He'll be all right. He's in good hands. Come on!  
(Dibber grabs Peri's hand.)  
PERI: No!

**[Katryca's hut]**

KATRYCA: Escaped? I told you to guard them!  
BALAZAR: Well, the Immortal came and took them.  
BROKEN TOOTH: We both saw him, Katryca. He walked through the wall.  
KATRYCA: Get the guns!

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

(The villagers weeding the crops don't even look up as the service robot
trundles past.)  
DRATHRO: Habitations.  
TANDRELL: Only man makes habitations.  
DRATHRO: All life perished in the fire. If men now live on the surface, they
must have come from my biosphere.  
TANDRELL: How can that be possible?  
HUMKER: It is forbidden.  
TANDRELL: All work units obey you orders.  
DRATHRO: Some must have escaped. Helped to escape. That is what has happened.  
HUMKER: Is it important?  
DRATHRO: They're out of control, outside the plan.  
TANDRELL: They're outlaws.  
DRATHRO: Now my existence is threatened. They have destroyed the source of my
energy. Take measures, create a defensive system, identify and destroy the
traitors.

**[** **Trial room]**

DOCTOR: All this is irrelevant and hypothetical.  
VALEYARD: Background testimony.  
DOCTOR: What possible value does the Farmyard here think there is in listening
to some half-incapacitated robot, and a couple of diminutive nit-wits who
might as well be robots?  
INQUISITOR: You're allowing your disrespect to show again, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, ma'am, but the question still stands.  
INQUISITOR: As prosecutor, the Valeyard has the right to include any evidence
he considers to be relevant, provided he can justify its inclusion.  
DOCTOR: But any record relating to persons not in my presence must be sheer
conjecture.  
VALEYARD: The accused is clearly ignorant of the latest methods of
surveillance, my lady.  
INQUISITOR: This evidence is taken from the Matrix, a knowledge bank fed
constantly by the experiences of all Time Lords, wherever they may be.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, ma'am. I know that. My whole point is that
I'm not.  
INQUISITOR: Not what?  
DOCTOR: Not part of the scenes being shown by the Scrapyard here. I'm sorry,
Valeyard. Force of habit, I apologise.  
VALEYARD: Doctor, the experience of third parties can also be monitored and
accessed if needed, as long as they are in the collection range of a Tardis.  
DOCTOR: Oh. But my Tardis is an old model. Are you telling me it's been bugged
without my knowledge?  
INQUISITOR: Bugged?  
VALEYARD: It is a reference apparently to the new surveillance system, my
lady. The expression derives from an Earth term.  
INQUISITOR: I see. I think we are wasting time on an unimportant issue.
Continue the evidence, Valeyard.

**[Ravalox]**

(The Doctor's position has been changed, and he is now being carried face up
in the service robots 'arms'. Katryca and her hunting party catch up with it
and block its way. Glitz, Peri and Dibber watch from a distance.)  
KATRYCA: Stop, Immortal!  
(The robot moves forward and the villagers retreat. Then Katryca fires the
first shot.)  
PERI: They'll kill the Doctor!  
GLITZ: We've all got to go sometime, Peri.  
PERI: You're all heart!  
GLITZ: The supreme sacrifice. What a person. If I have time, I'll compose the
eulogy for his funeral.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

DRATHRO: They have guns. From where?  
HUMKER: Guns can be manufactured.  
TANDRELL: Though manufacturing requires advanced technology, Humker.  
HUMKER: Yes, but the fact that they have guns also means that they possess
advanced technology.  
TANDRELL: False reasoning again, Humker. These are savages. Their guns must
have been supplied from without.  
DRATHRO: The Doctor.  
(The screen gets lines on it.)  
HUMKER: The L1 robot has ceased to function.  
TANDRELL: From the present data that we have, that would seem a logical
presumption.  
HUMKER: It is obvious. It has ceased transmitting signals.  
TANDRELL: I was replying to Drathro.  
DRATHRO: The Doctor is from Gallifrey. He has been sent to recover the secrets
left by the Sleepers. To do that, he has armed the outlaws. Therefore his
intention is to ferment a rebellion against my authority.  
TANDRELL: (sotto) And with nothing left but power from the few backup storage
cells he's quite likely to win.  
HUMKER: Then what will happen to us?  
TANDRELL: I dread to think.

**[Subway]**

(Grell is shadowing Merdeen down a wide corridor with a row of close-spaced
columns in the middle. Finally he confronts him.)  
MERDEEN: Are you following me?  
GRELL: Like you, I'm looking for a lost man. It simply occurred to me that it
might prove more productive if we searched as a team.  
MERDEEN: What makes you think the Doctor and Balazar will be together?  
GRELL: Events.  
MERDEEN: Meaning?  
GRELL: I don't think the Immortal's orders are always carried out, especially
when it comes to culling.  
MERDEEN: I always supervise the cullings myself.  
GRELL: I know.  
MERDEEN: Then what do you mean?  
GRELL: I think you send people outside.  
MERDEEN: Then they are destroyed by the fire. Does it really matter how they
die?  
GRELL: Depends whether you really believe that the surface of the planet still
burns.  
MERDEEN: I believe what the Immortal tells me.  
GRELL: Then you are a liar. The Doctor is with Balazar, isn't he? And both of
them have left the subways.  
MERDEEN: Then why does the Immortal instruct us to search for them?  
GRELL: I don't know. But I think we should talk about it. Unless you would
prefer that I took my suspicion to the Immortal.

**[Ravalox]**

BALAZAR: Is the Immortal dead at last?  
KATRYCA: The Immortal's reign is ended.  
BROKEN TOOTH: Katryca the Great One! Long live Queen Katryca!  
VILLAGERS: Long live Queen Katryca!  
BALAZAR: Now the Immortal is dead, how shall men live?  
KATRYCA: In the tribe of the Free we had no need of the Immortal. We shall
live as we always lived, except now, the Immortal's secrets shall be ours.  
BROKEN TOOTH: How?  
KATRYCA: Do you not see, Broken Tooth? They are ours for the taking.  
BALAZAR: The Immortal's castle?  
KATRYCA: Yes, Balazar. It is ours now. All the tools are metal. All the
strange materials that bend and do not break, All the mysteries and treasures
of our ancient forefathers that we shall learn to use again. Do you not agree?  
VILLAGERS: Yes!  
KATRYCA: Then let us attack!  
(The villagers run off.)  
PERI: Doctor!  
(Dibber and Glitz let her go, and follow slowly. The robot has dropped the
Doctor onto the ground, but he is still entangled by the cables.)  
PERI: Oh, Doctor, please.  
GLITZ: He's a goner. You can tell by his colour.  
DIBBER: Definitely a stiff, Mister Glitz.  
PERI: Help me get this thing off him.  
GLITZ: I shouldn't bother. He's probably got horrible injuries.  
DIBBER: Yeah, those ensign guns can blow you to bits.  
GLITZ: Talking of guns, Dibber, we need the heavy artillery. Which, if memory
serves me, are hidden not a more than a million miles from this very spot.  
DIBBER: Good idea of mine to bring the multiblaster, eh, Mister Glitz?  
GLITZ: I'll teach that two-faced harridan and her ignorant peasants to trifle
with Sabalom Glitz.  
DIBBER: But they've gone down the tunnel.  
GLITZ: So? We'll blow them out through the roof. That is, if the robot doesn't
get them first.  
DIBBER: So let's fetch them, then.  
GLITZ: No, you fetch them, Dibber. I'll meet you at the entrance.  
DIBBER: But those multiblasters must weigh at least a hundred  
GLITZ: Exactly. That is why I employ you to fetch and carry. Now, cut along,
there's a good lad.  
(Dibber leaves.)  
PERI: Doctor!  
_(The Doctor suddenly grabs Peri and pulls her to his chest.)  
DOCTOR: Keep your head down! Beware the hand! Keep your head down!  
_PERI: You're alive, I knew it.  
(The Doctor does a Jon Pertwee impression.)  
DOCTOR: Oh! My head hurts abominably, Sarah Jane. Where are we?  
PERI: I'm not Sarah Jane, I'm Peri.  
DOCTOR: Eh?  
PERI: And you're lying under the remains of a robot.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I remember now. Get this thing off me!  
PERI: I've been trying to.  
(Together he gets free and stands up.)  
DOCTOR: Where are Katryca and the others?  
PERI: They've gone to the tunnels.  
DOCTOR: Eh? Why?  
PERI: From what I could hear, now they've killed the Immortal, she's planning
a takeover.  
DOCTOR: But this isn't the Immortal, this is just. How long have they been
gone?  
PERI: A few minutes.  
DOCTOR: I've got to get after them.  
PERI: Why?  
DOCTOR: They've got to be stopped. The situation's worse than you imagine.  
PERI: It always is.

**[Underground station]**

KATRYCA: How does the great door open?  
BROKEN TOOTH: You turn this.  
KATRYCA: Then open it.  
(Broken Tooth obeys.)  
KATRYCA: Balazar, you and Broken Tooth have lived in this blackness. You will
lead the way.  
(She gives Balazar a hand gun.)  
BROKEN TOOTH: I know a tunnel that passes Marb Stati on and leads straight to
the Immortal's castle.  
KATRYCA: Then forward!

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

(The villagers are on the screen.)  
HUMKER: They look very fierce, Drathro.  
TANDRELL: Naturally. They live as wild creatures.  
HUMKER: They are coming towards us.  
TANDRELL: Humker, you have a gift for the obvious.  
HUMKER: Surely they will not attack us.  
TANDRELL: That is their intention.  
HUMKER: I do not understand the logic. We have not harmed them.  
DRATHRO: It is a rebellion.  
HUMKER: What shall we do if they break in?  
DRATHRO: I shall kill them.  
TANDRELL: Their guns destroyed the L1, Drathro.  
DRATHRO: My plating is stronger. My circuits are protected. Their guns will
kill only you.  
HUMKER: But if we die, who will look after your research?  
DRATHRO: The Doctor.

**[Subway]**

BROKEN TOOTH: Halt. I fear the worst.  
KATRYCA: What is wrong? We are lost?  
BROKEN TOOTH: Marb Station is back this way.  
BALAZAR: It is forward, and from thence the home of the Immortal.  
KATRYCA: We have no need for indecision in the tribe of the Free. Long we have
waited for this moment. The Immortal is dead, and we shall plunder his castle.
The spoils of triumph are ours. Now think, which is the way.  
BALAZAR + BROKEN TOOTH: This way.  
(They point in opposite directions.)  
KATRYCA: Am I to be surrounded by fools? We go forward.  
BROKEN TOOTH: But Katryca  
KATRYCA: Forward, I say. I have read it in the flames many times. We go
forward.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

(Humker is watching Tandrell mend a piece of equipment.)  
HUMKER: That is not correct.  
TANDRELL: Clearly there is a mechanical defect, Humker.  
HUMKER: An electronic malfunction.  
TANDRELL: Perhaps the Doctor caused the problem.  
HUMKER: Have you seen this, Drathro?  
DRATHRO: I do not need to observe, my condition tells me of the movement
failure of the black light system.  
HUMKER: What could have precipitated it?  
TANDRELL: There weren't any warning signs.  
DRATHRO: The destruction of the converter's aerial.  
TANDRELL: Destruction?  
DRATHRO: The service robot monitored the fact as it entered the village.  
TANDRELL: Can we repair it?  
DRATHRO: No. Soon the black light system will collapse in upon itself, and we
shall all cease to function.

**[Underground station]**

DOCTOR: Trouble is, his refraction dipoles are worn out. Nothing for it now
but to shut the black light system down.  
PERI: That sounds easy enough.  
DOCTOR: Oh, it is, but if I shut the black light system down I must shut
Drathro down as well. I can hardly see him agreeing to that.  
PERI: Well, what happens if he won't let you?  
DOCTOR: Then the black light system will implode and destroy everything in
these tunnels.  
PERI: Oh great, so that's why we're going in, is it?  
DOCTOR: Peri, I can't let people die if there's a chance of saving them.

**[Outside the tunnel entrance]**

GLITZ: You got the guns, then.  
DIBBER: Well, it looks like it, Mister Glitz.  
GLITZ: I'll tell you something funny, Dibber. We was wrong about the Doctor.
He's bunked off.  
DIBBER: He hasn't bunked off. He's gone down there.  
GLITZ: What?  
DIBBER: I saw them as I came up. He had Peri with him.  
GLITZ: So, he is after what we are.  
DIBBER: Well, could be.  
GLITZ: Course he is. I knew it all along. He's got no more interest in the
scientific side of things than I have.  
DIBBER: Well, you didn't fool him, telling him you're a philatelist, did you,
mister Glitz?  
GLITZ: Philanthropist, you ignorant dink. Didn't you learn nothing in that
remand home?  
DIBBER: Well, whatever the word, he guessed that you weren't one.  
GLITZ: Don't I look like a philanthropist?  
DIBBER: Well, how do I know? I've never seen one.  
GLITZ: A philanthropist, my son, is someone who gives away all their grotzits
out of the simple goodness of their heart.  
DIBBER: Oh, you mean they're stupid? Oh yeah, you probably do look like one,
then.  
GLITZ: Get down that hole.  
(Glitz picks up one of the multiblasters.)  
GLITZ: Oh dear, they are heavy, aren't they.

**[Underground station]**

GLITZ: Oh, please, Dibber!  
DIBBER: You always did despise muscle.  
GLITZ: Not at all, lad. Not when there are things to carry. Anyway, Dibber, if
we should run into the Doctor again  
DIBBER: We shoot him.  
GLITZ: Not a bad idea lad. But whatever you do, don't open your big pie-hole
and let him know that we're after the stuff.

**[** **Trial room]**

(Beep, beep, beep.)  
VALEYARD: The remainder of that evidence has been excised, my lady.  
INQUISITOR: Excised? Why?  
VALEYARD: By order of the High Council.  
INQUISITOR: This is a judicial enquiry appointed by the High Council but
independently conducted. It is my duty, Valeyard, to decide what evidence is
relevant.  
VALEYARD: Of course, my lady. The High Council simply felt that certain areas
of testimony should not be revealed.  
INQUISITOR: Why not?  
VALEYARD: Against the public interest, my lady.  
INQUISITOR: I cannot conduct a proper and searching enquiry without full
access to the evidence.  
VALEYARD: Naturally, Inquisitor, their honours would be quite prepared to let
you consider the full record in camera.  
INQUISITOR: And I think that would be unfair to the defendant. Do you wish to
lodge an official objection at this stage, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Well, I, er. No, ma'am. No, let the Valeyard here continue. Give him
enough rope to hang himself, eh?  
INQUISITOR: As you wish. Proceed.

**[Marb Station]**

(Where the water flasks are.)  
DOCTOR: Hurry, Peri, there isn't much time.  
PERI: Well, how long before this black light thing blows up?  
DOCTOR: There's no telling. We've got to get past Queen Katryca, into the
castle and make that demented robot see sense.  
MERDEEN: So, you have returned.  
DOCTOR: Merdeen. Missed your train?  
MERDEEN: The train is noisy. We hunt by foot.  
DOCTOR: Oh. What are you hunting?  
MERDEEN: You!  
(Merdeen points his crossbow at the Doctor, and fires the bolt.)

__**Part Four**__

**[Marb station]**

(The bolt hits Grell, who was crouched by the steps. Merdeen runs over to the
dying man.)  
MERDEEN: Why, Grell? Why?  
GRELL: You. Betrayed  
MERDEEN: No! We were not meant to live like this. We were not meant to  
(Grell dies.)  
MERDEEN: We should be free. He wanted the glory of your capture to please the
Immortal.  
DOCTOR: Don't blame yourself, Merdeen.  
MERDEEN: I've known him all his life. I asked for him to join the guards. I
helped him. I even hoped that one day he would see there is no reason for the
cullings.  
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps I can convince the Immortal of that. I must get to his
castle.  
MERDEEN: He'll kill you.  
DOCTOR: Not if he thinks I can still be of use to him. Come on, there isn't
much time.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

DRATHRO: The black light system will collapse in upon itself and we shall all
cease to function.  
TANDRELL: We should leave here, Humker.  
HUMKER: But where would we go?  
TANDRELL: I don't know, but Drathro says that if we stay for this explosion we
shall all be killed. So, the logical course is to leave.  
(The screen comes back to life.)  
HUMKER: The wild ones. We're too late!  
TANDRELL: You know, I've always said you talked too much. Come on!

**[Outside Drathro's 'castle']**

(Broken Tooth tries to open the doors.)  
BROKEN TOOTH: They are iron, Katryca. They will not yield.  
KATRYCA: Then we will cut down the wall. Fetch tools!  
BALAZAR: Wait! The doors open.  
KATRYCA: Come. The Immortal is dead. We have nothing to fear.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

(Drathro steps forward to meet her.)  
KATRYCA: It can't be!  
(Humker and Tandrell take the opportunity to escape.)  
DRATHRO: Why have you entered here?  
KATRYCA: The guns, Broken Tooth.  
DRATHRO: Lay aside your useless toys. I asked, why have you entered here?  
KATRYCA: We are the tribe of the Free.  
DRATHRO: You are vassals. Outside the law, outside the plan. You have brought
disorder where order reigned.  
(Drathro knocks Broken Tooth's gun from his hand.)  
KATRYCA: I am Katryca, queen of the  
(Drathro takes Katryca by the throat. Broken Tooth grabs Drathro's arm and
they both scream as blood vessels burst in their skin. Finally, Drathro drops
their corpses to the floor.)  
DRATHRO: You cause me to waste energy. Now return to wait outside. You will be
culled in accordance with the plan.  
BALAZAR: Oh, great Immortal one  
DRATHRO: Go! Do not attempt to hide. My guards will track you down.  
(The villagers go to pick up Katryca and Broken Tooth's bodies and leave.)

**[Subway]**

HUMKER: I remember these subways from my childhood.  
TANDRELL: Is this the way to the surface?  
HUMKER: I said I remember the subways, Tandrell, not where they led.  
TANDRELL: If we do not find the surface, Drathro will send his guards after
us.  
HUMKER: First he must deal with the wild ones and then if there's an explosion  
DOCTOR: Ah, Tumker and Handrail. Now, where are you two off to?  
HUMKER: We are leaving, Doctor.  
TANDRELL: Drathro says there's going to be an explosion.  
DOCTOR: I know.  
TANDRELL: It is a mechanical fault.  
HUMKER: Electronic.  
TANDRELL: There is a constant external discharge from one pole to the other.  
DOCTOR: Then I may only have minutes. Come along!  
(Peri and Merdeen follow the Doctor.)  
_TANDRELL: Excuse me, do you know the way to the surface?  
(Peri comes back.)  
PERI: Round the corner, keep straight, turn right at what used to be Oxford
Circus, then ask again. I think._

**[** **Trial room]**

DOCTOR: I didn't appear to be hurrying there, did I? But that deceptively easy
gait of mine covers the ground at amazing speed.  
INQUISITOR: I did not interrupt the evidence to commend you on your
athleticism, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, you can if you like. All compliments gratefully accepted.  
INQUISITOR: And may I remind you yet again that this is a serious trial.  
DOCTOR: It is not serious! It's a farce! A farrago of trumped up charges.  
INQUISITOR: You will have the opportunity in due course to rebut any or all of
the Valeyard's charges.  
DOCTOR: Oh, the Valeyard's charges. I always thought Valeyard meant learned
court prosecutor.  
VALEYARD: And so it does.  
DOCTOR: Not in your case, sir. Your points of law are spurious, your evidence
weak, verging on the irrelevant, and your reasoning quite unsound. In fact,
your point of view belongs in quite another place. Perhaps the mantle of
Valeyard was a mistake. I would therefore suggest that you change it for the
garment of quite another sort of yard. That of the knackers' yard. For your
argument is as tired and warn out as the poor, unfortunate creatures that end
up there.  
INQUISITOR: You will apologise at once!  
DOCTOR: For telling the truth? Never!  
VALEYARD: The Doctor is well known for these childish outbursts. I do not find
the ramblings of an immature mind offensive.  
DOCTOR: Immature?  
VALEYARD: It is that particular state of mind that has made it necessary for
you to be brought before this court.  
DOCTOR: Immature? I was on Ravalox trying to avert a catastrophe. The deaths
of several hundred innocent people! Surely not even in the eyes of Time Lords
can that be deemed either immature or a crime.  
VALEYARD: The crime was in being there, Doctor! Your immaturity was in not
realising you had broken a cardinal law of the Time Lords. Your presence
initiated the whole chain of events that we have witnessed.  
INQUISITOR: Thank you, Valeyard. It was that point about the relevance of the
testimony that I had intended to raise.  
VALEYARD: My pleasure, Inquisitor.  
DOCTOR: Oh, this is ridiculous. _Drathro's black light system was in a state
of terminal decay before I even arrived on that planet.  
VALEYARD: That is not in question. However, but for your intervention, the two
technological trainees, Humker and Tandrell, might have repaired the defect.  
DOCTOR: Oh, after Dibber had blown the aerial up? Ridiculous. Anyway, those
two couldn't repair a leaking tap. _  
INQUISITOR: May we continue? I tire of this empty banter.  
VALEYARD: Of course, my lady.

**[Outside Drathro's 'castle']**

DOCTOR: What's happened?  
BALAZAR: Alas, Doctor, these are woeful times for the tribe of the Free. The
queen is dead.  
PERI: Katryca? How?  
BALAZAR: The Immortal struck her down with a bolt of lightning.  
DOCTOR: Where is he now?  
BALAZAR: The all-powerful is in his castle.  
PERI: Why'd he let you go?  
BALAZAR: We are waiting to be culled.  
DOCTOR: Oh, you'll be culled all right, if I don't get inside that castle,
along with everybody else around here. Drathro, this is the Doctor. Let me in
at once, do you hear me?  
MERDEEN: It's no good, Doctor. You can only speak to the Immortal through the
communication box.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I forgot. He doesn't exactly entertain very much, does he? Right,
quickly, man. Take me to the nearest one.

**[Subway]**

DIBBER: How do we find this castle?  
GLITZ: Dibber, stop. I must rest. I am exhausted.  
DIBBER: If we ever do find this castle, and we knock out the L3, how do you
know we're going to find all these secrets that you keep on about?  
GLITZ: Would I have spent all the time, effort, not to mention a small
fortune, if I wasn't certain on that point?  
DIBBER: Yeah, but even if we do find them, they might not be worth anything.
Not after five hundred years.  
GLITZ: Do me a favour, Dibber. The Sleepers found a way into  
(Glitz's voice is obliterated by censorship beeps.)  
GLITZ: The biggest net of information in the

**[** **Trial room]**

DOCTOR: What is going on?  
INQUISITOR: That question had formed in my mind, Valeyard.  
VALEYARD: The information extracted is for your eyes and ears only, my lady.  
INQUISITOR: Something else that is not in the public interest to reveal?  
VALEYARD: Exactly, my lady.  
DOCTOR: Well, this is a charade. If that information was known to those two
rogues, what possible reason can there be from concealing it from this court?  
VALEYARD: This trial is concerned only with your actions, Doctor, and their
consequences, nothing else. Wider issues, if there are any, are not within our
terms of reference.  
INQUISITOR: Perhaps that is something I should decide, Valeyard.  
VALEYARD: Of course, my lady, but my own instructions were to peruse only
matters pertinent to the central issue.  
INQUISITOR: That is accepted. However, I should like to see the last sequence
again.  
DOCTOR: Yes.

**[Subway]**

GLITZ: Do me a favour, Dibber. The Sleepers found a way into the (beep beep),
the biggest net of information in the universe. Do you think they were nicking
recipes for making chutney?  
DIBBER: Yeah, but do you know what the secrets are?  
GLITZ: Facts, my son, figures, formulas. Travelling faster than light, anti
gravity power, dimensional transference. Scientific stuff like that. Worth a
fortune.  
DIBBER: How?  
GLITZ: Oh. We sell it, Dibber. A government here, a federation there. They're
all in the market for that sort of hi-tech cobblers. Don't think about it,
Dibber. You'll give yourself a hernia.

**[By a communications box]**

(Merdeen turns it on.)  
MERDEEN: The Immortal does not always answer.  
DRATHRO [OC]: Yes, Merdeen?  
MERDEEN: Immortal, you commanded me to find the Doctor. I have him here.  
DRATHRO [OC]: Show me.  
DOCTOR: I have returned to help you, Drathro.  
DRATHRO [OC]: You are too late.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

DOCTOR [on screen]: If I believed that, I would not be here.  
DRATHRO: You are here because Merdeen found you.  
DOCTOR [on screen]: No, Drathro, I came voluntarily. There may yet be time to
fix the black light system.  
DRATHRO: Very well, Doctor. Present yourself at my portals alone. Merdeen?  
MERDEEN [on screen]: Yes, Immortal?  
DRATHRO: Assemble my guards. Cull all the organics who stand waiting outside
my castle.  
MERDEEN: At once, Immortal.  
(Transmission ends.)  
DRATHRO: Humker? Tandrell?

**[By a communications box]**

PERI: You can't do it, Merdeen. You can't kill all those innocent people.  
BALAZAR: Peri is right. You have seen the truth. It would be murder to kill
them.  
MERDEEN: Neither can I free them.  
PERI: Well, just leave them. Leave them for the present, anyway.  
MERDEEN: The Immortal will kill me.  
PERI: Oh Merdeen, if the Doctor's right, we're all in danger anyway. We might
all die.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

(The Doctor enters.)  
DOCTOR: Well, I don't need a computer to tell me that system is defunct. I
must shut it down.  
DRATHRO: No! You will not shut it down!  
DOCTOR: But it's the only way.  
DRATHRO: If the system is shut down, I too cease.  
DOCTOR: But if it's allowed to run wild and lead to  
DRATHRO: Termination point.  
DOCTOR: Yes, then you'll cease then, Drathro. And so will everything else
around here.  
DRATHRO: That does not matter, Doctor. All that you see it my creation.  
DOCTOR: But there are several hundred people here as well, Drathro.  
DRATHRO: The work units exist only to serve me. Without me they would have no
function.  
DOCTOR: You can't see beyond the end of your tin nose, can you?  
DRATHRO: Is that abuse?  
DOCTOR: Listen.  
DRATHRO: I am listening.  
DOCTOR: You are only a robot. The people out there, the work units, the
organics, whatever you choose to call them, they're living creatures, Drathro.
They have a right to their lives.  
DRATHRO: Explain why.  
DOCTOR: In your terms, I can't. Whoever programmed you forgot to include moral
values.  
DRATHRO: I know of values. Is your point that organics are of more value than
robots?  
DOCTOR: Yes, if you want to look at it that way.  
DRATHRO: Then why should I be in command of organics if they are of greater
value?  
DOCTOR: Without organics there wouldn't be any robots. There'd be no one to
create them.  
DRATHRO: Accepted. This shows that robots are more advanced, therefore of more
value.

**[Outside Drathro's 'castle']**

PERI: Is there another way into the castle, Merdeen?  
MERDEEN: Another way?  
PERI: Well, you know what I mean. A back door or something.  
MERDEEN: There are only the big doors.  
PERI: Well, there must be some other way in.  
MERDEEN: Why?  
PERI: The Doctor might need help. I've got to get in there.  
BALAZAR: There's the ration chute.  
PERI: Ration chute?  
MERDEEN: Of course. Each day the Immortal sends out food to the work units.
Perhaps that leads into the castle.  
PERI: Merdeen, you're a pal. Oh, you're both pals. Now show me.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

DOCTOR: Your trouble is, Drathro, that you've no concept of what life is.  
DRATHRO: I have studied my work units for five centuries. I understand all
their responses. What you would call life.  
DOCTOR: Understanding is not the same as knowing, Drathro. Your work units are
the result of millions of years of development. Life, Drathro.  
DRATHRO: I understand evolution.  
DOCTOR: But you don't. If you could understand one tenth of what life was
about, you'd want me to save those people out there.  
DRATHRO: Why? I have said that without me they have no purpose.  
DOCTOR: Everything in life has its purpose, Drathro. Every creature plays its
part. But the purpose of life is too big to be knowable. A million computers
couldn't solve that one.  
DRATHRO: This discussion is of no value. I do not wish the work units to
continue when I have ceased to function.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's it, isn't it? Hubris!  
DRATHRO: Hubris?  
DOCTOR: Yes, hubris. False pride. A human sin. You've controlled your
pointless little empire for too long. Now you can't see anything beyond it.

**[Outside Drathro's 'castle']**

(Glitz's map has brought him to the right place.)  
GLITZ: We'll have to blast through them, Dibber.  
DIBBER: Don't like it, Mister Glitz.  
GLITZ: Five rounds rapid should do the trick.  
(The Brigadier would be proud.)  
DIBBER: And what if the L3's still functioning?  
GLITZ: Eh?  
DIBBER: What if he's got an emergency backup support system?  
GLITZ: There are a lot of what ifs there, lad.  
DIBBER: Yeah, but the most important of all is, what if I'm right? _If we
blast our way through there, well, he's not going to sit there on his iron
botty, is he.  
GLITZ: I see what you mean.  
DIBBER: We walk through those doors and boom!  
GLITZ: Boom, eh?  
DIBBER: Well, he's probably got the floor mined. That's what I'd do.  
GLITZ: You'd better go in first, then.  
DIBBER: Oh, very droll, Mister Glitz. Now, what we got to do, we got to pick
him off somehow so that he doesn't even know what's hit him. _

**[Subway]**

PERI: Oh I don't know. All these subways look the same to me. Are you sure
this leads into the castle?  
MERDEEN: It must do.  
BALAZAR: There's no where else it could go.  
PERI: Talk about the tradesman's entrance.  
(Glitz and Dibber approach from behind.)  
GLITZ: Well, well.  
PERI: Glitz and Dibber. I wondered where you two had got to.  
GLITZ: How do you do? Where is your friend, the Doctor?  
PERI: He's in the castle.  
GLITZ: He didn't hang about, did he?  
PERI: I'm worried about him.  
GLITZ: So am I.  
PERI: Well, Merdeen thinks we can get in through this hatch.  
GLITZ: Go on, then.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

DOCTOR: It's only a matter of minutes, Drathro. Can't I make you see sense?  
DRATHRO: It is finished.  
DOCTOR: It's not just this planet. Nobody knows where a black light explosion
might end. There's never been one.  
DRATHRO: There will be soon.  
DOCTOR: Some people think it might cause a chain reaction which could roll on
until all matter in the galaxy is exhausted. Is that what you want?  
DRATHRO: It is no longer of concern to me.  
DOCTOR: Others believe an explosion might cause dimensional transference,
which would threaten the stability of the entire universe. __

_**[** **Trial room]** _

_DOCTOR: Is that what I should have allowed to happen? The destruction of the
universe?  
(For once the Valeyard is speechless.)_

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

_DOCTOR: These systems are protected by three shut-down levers. I must close
them, Drathro. I must!  
_DRATHRO: Look!  
DOCTOR: What is it?  
DRATHRO: Intruders in the food production chamber!  
(Merdeen is on the screen.)  
DRATHRO: So, that was your intention, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: What?  
DRATHRO: To distract me.  
DOCTOR: That's Peri.  
(The walls of the chamber are covered in green globules. As they all move
inside, the hatch behind them closes.)  
DOCTOR: You can't do that! You can't!  
(A large fan in a tunnel starts to move forward whilst laser beams play
through the main chamber. The floor becomes very slippery.)

**[Outside Food Processing]**

BALAZAR: What's happening?

**[Food Processing chamber]**

PERI: What are we going to do? If we don't drown to death, we'll be fried.

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

DOCTOR: No!  
(Drathro knocks the Doctor to the floor.)

**[Food Processing chamber]**

DIBBER: Stand back.  
(Dibber fires his multiblaster at the wall. He creates a large hole, and the
lasers stop. Outside, Balazar gets a faceful of green gloop.)

**[Drathro's 'castle']**

(Drathro takes Dibber's multiblaster from him.)  
GLITZ: We come in friendship!  
PERI: Doctor, are you all right?  
DOCTOR: Yeah, I'm all right for the moment, though not for long I fear.  
GLITZ: What?  
DRATHRO: I would kill you all now, but it is unnecessary. We are waiting for
something the Doctor tells me is unique. A black light explosion.  
GLITZ: Do something, Dibber.  
DIBBER: Such as what?  
DOCTOR: I've been trying to convince this mobile junk heap here that none of
this need happen if he'd only let me shut the system down.  
GLITZ: That seems eminently sensible.  
DOCTOR: Oh, he won't listen to reason. He needs black light to function so he
sees no reason why the rest of us should survive. That is roughly your narrow,
egotistical little view, isn't it, Drathro?  
DRATHRO: If I am doomed, then you are all doomed.  
GLITZ: Now, wait a minute. I mean, why don't we just. I mean, if it's only
black light you want, Drathro, we have plenty of that. Don't we, Dibber?  
DIBBER: Do we?  
GLITZ: On the ship, Dibber.  
DIBBER: Oh, the black light. Yeah, we've got so much of that sometimes we can
hardly see.  
DRATHRO: There is black light on your ship?  
GLITZ: As my friend says. So, what I suggest we do is you come with us and
we'll fix you up, eh?  
DRATHRO: Why?  
GLITZ: Well, I hate to see a good looking robot like you go to waste. I'll
tell you what else we can do for you. We can drop you back in the
constellation of Andromeda. How about that?  
DRATHRO: It is possible?  
GLITZ: And, oh, the secrets. Of course, you must bring them. I mean, they'll
expect you to bring them.  
DRATHRO: How far from here is your ship?  
GLITZ: Oh, right outside, really. No distance at all.  
DRATHRO: I could function for a short distance.  
GLITZ: Of course you could.  
DRATHRO: Then I accept your offer. Take that. Tie these others up. I will
fetch the secrets.  
GLITZ: You two, over there.  
DOCTOR: Well done!  
DIBBER: Sorry, Doc. You heard what he said.  
DOCTOR: Don't be a fool!  
(Drathro takes one box from an array of them on the wall as Glitz ties up the
Doctor. Dibber ties up Merdeen and Peri.)  
GLITZ: Slip-knot, Doctor. The best I can do for you.  
DOCTOR: Strange how low cunning succeeds where intelligent reasoning fails.  
GLITZ: Don't knock low cunning, Doctor. You're still here, aren't you? Oh,
that's it is it? The secrets. My word, there should be a lot there. All
microdots, no doubt. Come along then, Dibber. Open the door for the Immortal.  
(Glitz, Dibber and Drathro leave. The Doctor quickly frees himself then cuts
Merdeen and Peri free.)  
DOCTOR: Quickly, you've got to help me. It's a three stage cut-out. We've got
to try and shut the machine down.  
PERI: Will that prevent an explosion?  
DOCTOR: All I can do now is hope to contain it. Peri, press that row of
buttons in front of you.  
PERI: Which ones?  
DOCTOR: All of them! Merdeen, flick up all the switches with red neons on
them.  
MERDEEN: Neons?  
DOCTOR: Oh, show him, Peri.  
PERI: Those. How much time do have we got?  
DOCTOR: Not long. Oh, these levers haven't been moved in centuries.  
(The Doctor pushes down the first of the reluctant plungers.)  
PERI: Now what?  
DOCTOR: Get out of here, the pair of you.  
PERI: What about you?  
DOCTOR: Get out! Merdeen, take her.  
(The second plunger finally goes down. The third is irrevocable stuck. The
Doctor heads for the door.)  
DOCTOR: I did my best. I only hope it's enough.  
(The Doctor flees down the corridor. Behind him there is a big KaBOOM! The
shockwave travels out along the subways and knocks Balazar over.)

**[Underground station]**

(Drathro roars.)  
GLITZ: It's blowing up!  
(Glitz and Dibber take cover as Drathro topples forward before glowing red hot
and burning. Dibber investigates while Glitz keeps his fingers in his ears and
his eyes shut.)  
DIBBER: Er, you're not going to like this, Mister Glitz.  
GLITZ: Is it finished?  
DIBBER: All finished. And the secrets.  
(The box disintegrates in Dibbers hand.)  
GLITZ: Eh?  
DIBBER: Well, except for this.  
GLITZ: And what's that?  
DIBBER: It's a piece of black light converter aerial. Pure silictone.  
GLITZ: The hardest known metal in the galaxy.  
DIBBER: And the most expensive. What's more, there's got to be a couple of
tons of the stuff  
GLITZ: I'm way ahead of you, my son. You know we could clean up on this job
very nicely. What's more, we have a tasty little kitty for the next venture.  
(Glitz and Dibber leave. Humker and Tandrell run in.)  
HUMKER: Fresh air. What a wonderful smell.  
TANDRELL: Do you know, you're right. Absolutely wonderful.  
_HUMKER: That's the first time you've ever agreed with me.  
TANDRELL: I know. Strange, isn't it._

**[Marb station]**

DOCTOR: And still the lobster held on. You're in a worse mess than I am.  
BALAZAR: Are Merdeen and Peri safe?  
DOCTOR: You can ask them for yourself.  
MERDEEN: Balazar!  
PERI: Oh, I wish you wouldn't keep frightening me like this.  
DOCTOR: I told you to get out of here.  
PERI: Please don't start. I'm too tired and too scared to cope.  
DOCTOR: All right.  
BALAZAR: This seems to be the end, Doctor. As it is written in the books.  
DOCTOR: No, Balazar. For you, this is the beginning. Chapter one, paragraph
one, as they say. Take your people up to the surface where they belong.  
BALAZAR: Yes. Perhaps at last we shall find the habitat of the Canadian goose.  
DOCTOR: Perhaps.  
(The Doctor samples the green gloop on Balazar.)  
DOCTOR: Mmm. I think dinner's on him. Farewell, my loquacious friend. Right,
let's get back to the Tardis.  
PERI: It's the other way.  
DOCTOR: What is?  
PERI: The Tardis.  
DOCTOR: I know. It's that way. Yes. Farewell. But there are still one or two
questions that have to be answered, like who moved this planet two light years
off its original course, and what was in that box that Glitz and Dibber were
so interested it?  
BALAZAR: Goodbye, Old One, and thank you for your help.  
PERI: Old One. Hey, that's cute.  
DOCTOR: I always knew there was an evil streak in you. Old One indeed.

**[** **Trial room]**

DOCTOR: Well, that's one up to me, I think. There can't be many people who can
literally claim to have saved the entire universe. Well, if that's all the
muck you can rake up  
VALEYARD: Sit down. Smugness does not become you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: That is an irrelevant observation. I think it's now my turn to prevent
the case for the defence.  
INQUISITOR: In due course.  
DOCTOR: Well, that's not fair. Look, I wish it put on record that my
involvement in the affairs of that planet resulted in the freedom of Drathro's
underground slaves.  
INQUISITOR: That has been noted.  
DOCTOR: And despite the fact that evidence has been withheld, my presence
there was most specifically requested.  
VALEYARD: You showed little reluctance in complying with the request.  
DOCTOR: Well, lives were at stake.  
VALEYARD: Lives were lost, and because of your meddling, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: I deny that. Without my help, an entire civilisation might have been
wiped out.  
VALEYARD: Without your interference it might have involved less sacrifice of
human life.  
DOCTOR: That was a risk I had to take.  
VALEYARD: Risk! Risk! Hear how the Doctor condemns himself by his own words.  
INQUISITOR: Gentlemen! Doctor, perhaps you should heed the Valeyard. May I
suggest that for the time being you have said enough.  
DOCTOR: Said enough? Said enough? I have a great deal more to say.  
INQUISITOR: Be silent, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: I wish to demonstrate  
INQUISITOR: You will have your turn when the Valeyard has finished his
presentation.  
VALEYARD: Thank you, Inquisitor.  
DOCTOR: Well, if the rest of his presentation is as riveting as the first
little epic, wake me when it's finished.  
VALEYARD: Finished? I've barely started.  
DOCTOR: Well, for nothing more than your future in the legal profession, I
only hope your evidence gets a little better.  
VALEYARD: Oh yes, Doctor, much better. The most damning is still to come. And
when I have finished, this court will demand your life.
