**Attack of the Cybermen**  
  
Original Airdate: 5 Jan, 1985  

__**Part One**__

**[London sewers]**

(By torchlight, two Thames Water employees in hard hats are checking the
condition of Sir Joseph Bazalgette's magnificent Victorian construction.)  
DAVID: Yeah, let's take a look down here. Look at the state of it.  
BILL: This is a hoary old one. Talk about neglect.  
DAVID: Yeah, there can't have been anyone down here for years. There are more
bulges than an antenatal clinic.  
BILL: What's that?  
(The torchlight picks up a new brick wall.)  
BILL: Hang on a minute. We are under Fleet Street?  
DAVID: Well, you've got the map.  
BILL: According to this, there was work done here seven years ago. Three half
walls with vaulted buttresses.  
DAVID: We must be in the wrong tunnel.  
BILL: No, we're not.  
DAVID: Hang on, I'll check it out.  
(David leaves.)  
BILL: No, we are in the right tunnel. David? David! David? You all right?
David!  
(Something approaches. Bill screams then gets zapped.)

**[Tardis corridor]**

(The Doctor has two wall roundels open with wires hanging out.)  
DOCTOR: Here we go again.  
(He fiddles inside, then goes to another open roundel. There is a beep and he
returns to the first.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. Soon put you to rights.  
(The application of his sonic lance causes an electric arc.)  
DOCTOR: Well, that shouldn't have happened.  
(Peri comes running.)  
PERI: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Something I should have done a long time ago.

**[Tardis room]**

(A small table is loaded with spare circuit boards.)  
DOCTOR: Repair the chameleon circuit.  
PERI: What?  
DOCTOR: The Tardis, when working properly, is capable of many amazing things,
not unlike myself. One of its functions is that it can change shape to blend
perfectly with its surrounding environment.  
(He goes to an open roundel in this room.)  
PERI: I see.  
DOCTOR: Not yet, you don't. I wonder why I didn't do it before.  
PERI: Look, Doctor, do you really think you're up to this? I mean, you've only
recently regenerated and yet you've undertaken so much work.  
(The Doctor takes a bite from her apple and continues.)  
PERI: Well, what I really mean to say is, you still seem a little unstable.  
DOCTOR: Unstable? Unstable? Unstable! This is me, Peri. At this very moment I
am as stable as you will ever see me.  
PERI: Oh dear.  
DOCTOR: You must forget how I used to be. I'm a Time Lord. A man of science,
temperament and passion.  
PERI: And a very loud voice.

**[Tardis corridor]**

DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, that too. But not unstable. This is the real me, Peri. But
don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. I promise.

**[Tardis]**

(Peri follows the Doctor back into the console room, where he puts a component
inside the console.)  
PERI: I still think you're doing too much. You need to rest.  
DOCTOR: Rest? Nonsense. Rest is for the weary, sleep is for the dead. I feel
like a hungry man eager for the feast. Now, we've both spent too long in the
Tardis. We need a change. Where would you like to go?  
PERI: Well  
DOCTOR: For you, somewhere restful, I think. I'm sure after the bleakness of
Jaconda you could do with a sight of green hills, rolling countryside.  
PERI: Yes, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: I know the very place.  
(He enters coordinates and the Tardis tilts and goes wibbly, distorting their
voices. They hang on to the console.)  
PERI: Doctor, what's happening?  
DOCTOR: Just hold on.  
PERI: I'm being (something)  
DOCTOR: Keep hold.

**[Glenthorne Road, London]**

(A car pulls up outside the Dartmouth Castle pub, and a man we saw a few
stories ago walking away from the mayhem in Shad Thames dressed as a police
inspector looks up at the building.)  
LYTTON: Here we are, gentlemen. Inside that building is ten million pounds in
diamonds.  
(The two men in the back seat peer out of the window up at UIP House.)  
PAYNE: Tasty.  
GRIFFITHS: Very tasty.  
(Everyone say Hi! to  Brian Glover, sadly type-cast as a low-intelligence
villain.)  
LYTTON: How long will you need?  
RUSSELL: About half an hour.  
LYTTON: I'll send these two back with the car.  
RUSSELL: There's no need. I'll get a cab.  
LYTTON: I said, Russell, I'll send the car for you.  
RUSSELL: Right.  
LYTTON: Don't look so hurt. We're not going back to the flat. We're doing the
job today.  
GRIFFITHS: That's all of a sudden, isn't it?  
LYTTON: You had something else planned?  
GRIFFITHS: No, it's just that I was expecting a bit more notice.  
LYTTON: We go today, without fail.  
RUSSELL: What if I can't get the explosives?  
LYTTON: You assured me there's be no slip-ups.  
RUSSELL: Yeah. But seven kilos of plastic at such short notice?  
LYTTON: I hope you're not telling me that there'll be problems, Russell,
because if you are, I shall be very angry.  
RUSSELL: Don't worry, I'll get the stuff.  
LYTTON: Good.  
(Russell gets out of the car and walks away while Payne sniggers in the back.)  
PAYNE: I don't think he likes us very much, Mister Lytton.  
LYTTON: If he lets me down, he'll have reason not to. You, Payne, will kill
him.  
(Lytton drives them away.)

**[Telephone kiosk]**

(Russell is reporting in to someone.)  
RUSSELL: Job's today. Well, I don't know. He's playing everything so close.
There's seven kilos of plastic. Look, don't argue, just have the stuff ready.
I'm on my way in.

**[Tardis]**

(The Tardis has stabilised, and is still in flight.)  
DOCTOR: I must have crossed a wire.  
PERI: Well, I hope you never do anything more serious. I think my heart is
where my liver should be.  
DOCTOR: Really? At least the Tardis isn't damaged.  
PERI: Big deal.  
DOCTOR: Be grateful. If its shell had been punctured, you'd find it very
difficult to breath in a vacuum.  
PERI: I'm grateful. I'm grateful. Just tell me where we are, if you can.  
DOCTOR: O child of little faith.  
PERI: Do you blame me?  
(The Doctor turns on the scanner. A bright white blob with a tail is flying
through the blackness of space.)  
PERI: What's that?  
DOCTOR: Comet nine oblique one two oblique four four. To you, Halley's comet.  
PERI: It's very pretty, but it still doesn't tell me where we are.  
DOCTOR: In your sun's solar system, in the year that you would calculate as
1985. I was, in fact, taking you to Earth.  
PERI: Bit of an anticlimax after that journey.  
DOCTOR: Ungrateful wretch.  
PERI: Well, what do you expect, applause?  
DOCTOR: A little gratitude wouldn't irretrievably damage my ego.  
PERI: Come off it, Doctor. No one is more surprised than you that we came
through it.

**[Junk yard]**

(Lytton, Griffiths and Payne take bags from the boot of the car and go into
the building at the back of the yard.)  
GRIFFITHS: What's this then? I thought we were doing a diamond job.  
LYTTON: For once, Griffiths, you're right.  
GRIFFITHS: Then what are we doing here?  
LYTTON: It may come as a great disappointment to you, but I don't intend to
enter the bank guns blazing and my face covered in a nylon stocking.  
PAYNE: He's allergic to nylon.  
GRIFFITHS: No, I'm not.  
LYTTON: We go in via the sewers.  
(They all peer into the hole in the ground.)  
PAYNE: Crafty.  
GRIFFITHS: Down there?  
LYTTON: The way is prepared. All we have to do is remove a few bricks and
we're in the sewer itself.  
GRIFFITHS: That's good, but how do we get at the diamonds?  
LYTTON: Why do you think Russell has gone for explosives?  
GRIFFITHS: You must be joking. Set that lot off, you'll have the old bill down
on us.  
LYTTON: The vibrations will set off every alarm in the area. The police won't
know where to start.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: There, that should do it.  
PERI: No more death-defying rides?  
DOCTOR: Absolutely not.  
(An open roundel blows out.)  
DOCTOR: Well, hopefully not.  
PERI: Don't you think we should land?  
DOCTOR: Not at all. I have perfect rapport with this machine.  
PERI: I only hope the Tardis knows it. Look, Doctor, out there are thousands,
millions of tons of ice. One ill-considered move could cause us to collide
with it. I'm scared, Doctor. You don't seem to understand that.  
DOCTOR: Of course I do. But you have nothing to fear, I promise you.  
PERI: I hope not. It's rather ironic. On Earth, Halley's comet is always
associated with impending disaster.  
DOCTOR: That's nonsense.  
PERI: Not when you're this close, it isn't.

**[Junk yard]**

(Now dressed in black, Lytton opens a battered steel cabinet and switches on
some machinery that doesn't look as if it belongs there. It beeps a few times
then he turns it off again. Outside \- )  
PAYNE: Lose the motor. Come on.  
(Payne and Russell go into the junk yard as two policemen patrolling the other
side of the road stop and watch.)

**[Tardis]**

(Peri turns off the scanner and goes to a section of the console which is
beeping.)  
PERI: Does that noise have anything to do with you?  
DOCTOR: No. It's a distress signal.  
PERI: How do you know?  
DOCTOR: Doh. Listen. That is an intergalactic distress call.  
PERI: Where's it coming from?  
DOCTOR: Can't be far, the signal is very strong.  
PERI: What's all that other noise?  
DOCTOR: I'm not certain. Strange. It's coming from Earth. In 1985?  
PERI: That's not possible.  
DOCTOR: Possible it is. Desirable it isn't. I think when we arrive, we should
investigate.

**[Junk yard]**

(Lytton has got a sub-machine gun.)  
RUSSELL: Excessive.  
LYTTON: Insurance.  
RUSSELL: Start shooting that thing off, the police'll be calling out the SAS.  
GRIFFITHS: He's right. That thing, it's obscene.  
LYTTON: Armed robbery is armed robbery.  
RUSSELL: How many of those things are we taking?  
LYTTON: Just the one.  
RUSSELL: It's one too many.  
LYTTON: What about you, Payne?  
PAYNE: Oh, I'm with you, Mister Lytton.  
GRIFFITHS: I'm with you, Mister Lytton. You're with anything that gets you
money.  
LYTTON: Certainly there's dissent, and you, Russell, are at the centre of it.  
RUSSELL: I don't like guns, and I don't like all this secrecy. We're supposed
to be on a job, but we don't know what we're doing.  
LYTTON: You are new to this group and have yet to gain my confidence, that's
why I tell you nothing. These two are muscleheads and wouldn't understand what
I said anyway.  
GRIFFITHS: You've got a rough tongue, Mister Lytton.  
LYTTON: Which you will learn to live with, Griffiths, otherwise you're out.
And as your earnings have never been better, that would be rather foolish,
wouldn't it? Let's go. Come on, Payne, there's work to be done.  
PAYNE: Right.  
(Payne gets down into the narrow access tunnel.)  
PAYNE: Oh. Hey, how thick is the sewer wall?  
LYTTON: Oh, nothing you can't handle.  
(Payne takes the heavy lump hammer.)  
PAYNE: I used to use one of these when I worked for the council.  
LYTTON: This time it's for swinging, not leaning on.

**[Totter's Lane]**

(At number 76, the property of I M Foreman according to the sign by the gate,
the Tardis materialises in familiar territory. The Doctor peers out holding a
signal detector.)  
DOCTOR: This looks familiar.  
PERI: Where are we?  
DOCTOR: Scrap yard.  
PERI: I didn't mean that. I meant, whereabouts on Earth are we?  
DOCTOR: London.  
PERI: It didn't change.  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
PERI: I thought you said it was going to blend into its surroundings.  
DOCTOR: Oh, she's probably thinking about it. Come on, let's find out where
those signals are coming from.  
(The Tardis changes into a highly ornamented dresser.)  
PERI: Oh, neat, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Neat?  
PERI: Very neat. I mean, there's nothing at all incongruous about that.  
DOCTOR: Well, she hasn't done it for a long time. She's out of practice.  
PERI: Of course, Doctor.

**[London sewers]**

PAYNE: Hey, what about the ladder?  
LYTTON: Leave it.  
GRIFFITHS: How far do we have to go?  
LYTTON: About a mile.  
GRIFFITH: A mile in these boots?  
PAYNE: Ah, you. Not allergic to walking as well, are you?  
LYTTON: Move.  
GRIFFITHS: The boots don't fit me. And it smells.

**[Back alley]**

DOCTOR: I suddenly feel conspicuous.  
PERI: I'm not surprised in that coat.  
DOCTOR: It's more a question of having organised a surprise party and
forgotten who it's for.  
PERI: Look, Doctor, since you regenerated, it's as though your memory's been
put through the meat grinder. I mean, it's all there, but in a pile of
unrelated bits and pieces.  
DOCTOR: That's a horrible simile.  
PERI: It's true, though. In the past couple of days you've called me Tegan,
Zoe, Susan. On one occasion you even referred to me as Jamie.  
DOCTOR: Merely slips of the tongue.  
PERI: I rather think they're slips of the mind. And while we're about it, who
is this Terrible Zodin?  
DOCTOR: I called you Zodin, did I? Oh, they don't make villains like her any
more. A woman of rare guile and devilish cunning.  
PERI: Thanks a lot.  
DOCTOR: Perhaps you're right. My mind may be playing tricks on me. You know, I
haven't thought about Zodin for years.  
PERI: Now where?  
(The Doctor leads her out of the alley at the back of the houses into the road
proper. He starts to go towards the junction then turns and heads the other
way. As they pass the alleyway we see the two policemen standing there,
watching. The Doctor goes to a building on a corner.)  
DOCTOR: That's it. It's unoccupied.  
PERI: Are you sure this is the right place?  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. I'm a fool. Of course I am. That's precisely what I would
have done.  
PERI: What?  
(He runs back up the alley again. There are no policemen in sight.)  
DOCTOR: Come on.  
PERI: Oh, what?  
(The policemen reappear behind them.)

**[London sewers]**

RUSSELL: I don't want to put the wind up you, but I think we're being
followed.  
LYTTON: Are you sure?  
RUSSELL: Remember that scuffling sound we heard earlier? I heard it again.  
LYTTON: Payne, if we are being followed, deal with them.  
PAYNE: Right, check.  
LYTTON: This way.  
(Payne stays behind and waits.)

**[Totters Lane]**

(The Doctor sees the sign by the gate this time.)  
DOCTOR: Look, Susan.  
PERI: Peri. Yeah, well, supposing there really are aliens here on Earth. I
mean, does it really matter? I mean, they don't all have ten heads and want to
take over the world.  
DOCTOR: Precisely. The poor thing may be trapped here, terrified. If it is, I
can do something about it.  
(The Tardis is still the highly ornate and nicely painted with floral motifs
dresser or whatever. The policemen watch from the gate.)  
PERI: That's if you can find the entrance. How do we get in?  
DOCTOR: I'm not sure.  
PERI: Well, there still is a way in?  
DOCTOR: Of course there is. Somewhere.  
(The Doctor goes round the back then beckons to Peri. The policemen, who are
the ones Lytton was controlling back in Resurrection, watch impassively as the
Tardis dematerialises.)

**[Tardis]**

PERI: What are you searching for?  
DOCTOR: The source of the distress signal.  
PERI: I thought you said it was in the house?  
DOCTOR: It is, but the source of the signal is transmitting from some
elsewhere.  
PERI: I don't understand.  
DOCTOR: I also detected several weaker signals going into the house. Our alien
is being ultra-cautious. He's bouncing the signal off several relay points
around London. It could take days to find out where it's coming from.  
PERI: Giving him plenty of time to move on.  
DOCTOR: Hmm. You are brilliant, Peri. Absolutely brilliant! If the signal is
being relayed to prevent detection, then the house has to be watched.  
PERI: Otherwise, how would the alien know someone had discovered his main
transmitter?  
DOCTOR: Exactly. Let's find our alien before he has time to vanish.  
(The two policemen go to the junk yard.)  
DOCTOR: Almost there. Just got to lock on to his coordinates.  
PERI: I hope this alien appreciates what we're doing.  
DOCTOR: I'm sure he will. Probably sitting there all of a dither, waiting for
us to arrive.  
(Down in the sewers, the waiting Payne gets zapped by the high-pitched
whatever.)

**[Junk yard]**

(The Tardis materialises in Lytton's junk yard as a small pedal pipe organ.)  
DOCTOR: This is getting ridiculous.  
PERI: I'm not saying a word.  
DOCTOR: I was certain I'd fixed it.  
(He pulls out a stop and plays the opening line from JS Bach's Toccata and
Fugue in B Minor.)  
PERI: Shush! Are you sure this is the right place?  
(The Doctor follows the signal on his detector.)  
PERI: Doc!  
(And steps right over the open sewer entrance.)  
PERI: Tor.  
(The Doctor goes to the metal cabinet.)  
PERI: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Not now, Peri.  
PERI: Doctor!  
(A policeman with a silenced handgun is looking out of the hole in the
ground.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, how do you do, Constable?  
PERI: He's got a gun.  
DOCTOR: I'm not blind, Peri. You look uncomfortable in that hole. Let me help
you out.  
(The policeman waves his gun at the Doctor, who kicks it away then pushes him
down the hole. The Doctor follows and blows are exchanged out of sight. The
second policeman comes up behind Peri. She backs away to a pile of bricks,
gathers up some dust and throws it in his eyes. He drops the gun and she picks
it up.)  
PERI: Even I couldn't miss from this range.  
(The policeman relaxes as his colleagues helmet comes out of the hole. Peri
turns her gun on it, but the Doctor is wearing it.)  
PERI: Never do such a stupid thing again. I could have killed you.  
DOCTOR: I believe you.  
PERI: Don't patronise me.  
DOCTOR: I wouldn't dare. You did very well. I'm impressed.  
(The Doctor frisks the policeman and gets his handcuffs.)  
PERI: What happened to the other one?  
DOCTOR: He's er, having a little lie-down.  
(The Doctor handcuffs the policeman to a set of industrial scales.)  
DOCTOR: There. Key.  
(The policeman hands over a set of keys.)  
PERI: I'm assuming these aren't the real police.  
DOCTOR: I think you are correct in that assumption. Thank you.  
PERI: But why did they try to kill us?  
DOCTOR: The bottom of that pit has been dug out. I think it leads to the
sewers. Come on.  
(The Doctor takes off the policeman's helmet and disappears below ground. Peri
unscrews the silencer and puts the gun in her shorts pocket.)  
DOCTOR: Come on, Peri.

**[London sewers]**

RUSSELL: Payne's taking his time.  
GRIFFITHS: He's got lost. No sense of direction. No sense at all, come to
that.  
RUSSELL: You want me to go back?  
LYTTON: No, he'll find us once we start making some noise. We've arrived.  
RUSSELL: Can I see the map?  
(Lytton hands it over.)  
LYTTON: Right, Griffiths. That wall will have to come down.  
GRIFFITHS: How thick is it?  
LYTTON: Less than you.  
GRIFFITHS: That's not very kind, Mister Lytton.  
RUSSELL: Hang on a minute, this is getting stupid. That wall isn't supposed to
be there.  
LYTTON: The map, Russell, simply isn't pinpoint accurate.  
RUSSELL: Oh, great. Terrific. I thought you'd recced all this.  
LYTTON: We're in the right place.  
RUSSELL: But how do we know that's right? Nothing else is.  
LYTTON: Unless you want to throw away ten million pounds in diamonds, I
suggest one of you starts knocking the wall down.  
(Meanwhile, elsewhere in the dark.)  
PERI: I only hope this is the right direction.  
DOCTOR: You saw the signs and scuff marks on the bricks.  
PERI: They could have been made at any time.  
DOCTOR: No, they're recent. I have an instinct for these things.  
PERI: To think this is my first visit to London.  
DOCTOR: It is an interesting city.  
PERI: I'm sure it's fascinating. It'd be nice to see the sights like a regular
tourist.  
DOCTOR: Hmm? You'll find this route more memorable.  
PERI: That I believe.  
(Back with the putative bank robbers.)  
LYTTON: Still no sign of Payne?  
RUSSELL: Something's happened to him.  
LYTTON: Hardly.  
GRIFFITHS: Hey. Someone else want to have a go?  
RUSSELL: Not particularly.  
GRIFFITHS: This is hard work.  
LYTTON: There he is. What's he doing down there?  
RUSSELL: That's not Payne. It's too big. Shut that racket.  
GRIFFITHS: What's up?  
RUSSELL: There's someone in the tunnel. Challenge him.  
GRIFFITHS: We can still kill him.  
LYTTON: No.  
GRIFFITHS: What's the matter, you lost your bottle?  
(Light glints off the approaching silver humanoid.)  
GRIFFITHS: What is it?  
(Griffith produces a gun and shoots at it.)  
GRIFFITHS: Let him have it!  
LYTTON: Hold your fire!  
GRIFFITHS: What's your game, Lytton?  
LYTTON: Move back. Move back!  
(A doorway in the sewer wall slides open and more Cybermen appear.)  
LYTTON: My name is Lytton, and I am your prisoner, Cybermen.  
(Lytton hands over the gun, and the Cyberman breaks it in half. Griffiths
turns to run but a Cyberman is behind him so he screams instead.  
Elsewhere -)  
PERI: Doctor, you said it was gunfire.  
DOCTOR: I heard me. Someone may be hurt. They may need our help. Come along.  
PERI: Doctor.  
(The Doctor finds a body and Peri a gun. It must be Payne.)  
DOCTOR: His neck's been broken.  
PERI: Well, what did we hear? This hasn't been fired. We must fetch the
police.  
DOCTOR: One moment. I'm thinking.  
PERI: Look, Doctor, this isn't some deserted planet in the middle of nowhere.
You don't have to play the Lone Ranger.  
DOCTOR: Hmm? Yes. Yes, you're absolutely right. But first, let's find some
hard evidence.  
PERI: You've got a body here. What more do you want?  
DOCTOR: That's just the victim. The police will be more interested in the
perpetrator of the crime. This way.

**[Cyber lair]**

(A pretty big place to have stayed hidden. There are people and Cybermen in
some alcoves and one patrolling a catwalk in the background.)  
LEADER: How did you know where to find us?  
LYTTON: You have a ship hidden on the dark side of the moon. I tracked your
transmissions.  
LEADER: Inform Moonbase our signals are being detected. They must increase the
distortion.  
LYTTON: You're quite safe. Earth authorities can't pick up your signals. It's
beyond their technology.  
CYBERMAN: You were capable.  
LYTTON: I am not from Earth.  
LEADER: So you have said.  
CYBERMAN: But where do you come from?  
LYTTON: Vita Fifteen, in the star system six nine zero.  
LEADER: What is the name of your satellite?  
LYTTON: Riften Five.  
LEADER: I have heard of that place. It is occupied by a race of warriors.  
CYBERMAN: Who fight only for money, Leader. He is not to be trusted.  
LYTTON: Listen to me.  
CYBERMAN: You will show respect to the Leader.  
LYTTON: I will do more than that. I will serve him, aid you in your cause.  
LEADER: If that is true, when you become as we are, you will serve the Cyber
race well.  
LYTTON: Oh, no, as myself. You forget, Leader, I have been tracking your
transmissions. I know why you're here.  
CYBERMAN: He must be destroyed. He says he comes to aid us yet he carries
weapons.  
LYTTON: My gun was used in your cause. I didn't know he was armed.  
LEADER: You should not have brought others.  
LYTTON: I brought them as gifts for you to turn into Cybermen.  
CYBERMAN: He lies, Leader.  
LEADER: Silence. There is logic in what he says. If he had wished our
destruction, he could have betrayed our cause to Earth authorities.  
LYTTON: Precisely.  
LEADER: The Cyber Controller can decide their fate.  
LYTTON: Thank you, Leader. Where will I have the honour of meeting him?  
LEADER: If you know of our activities, you will know where he is.  
LYTTON: I assume he is still on the planet Telos.  
LEADER: He is.

**[Telos]**

(Once again, Gerrards Cross quarry is playing a dry and desolate place where
Cybermen stand guard over humanoid slave labour. Three men nod at each other
then Stratton knocks a Cyber head off with a piece of pipe while the other two
knock another over. A man is killed by a Cyberman up on top of the quarry.)  
BATES: Stratton, grab the head! The head!  
(Two Cybermen move in on Stratton. The one on the cliff edge destroys the
head.)  
STRATTON: What now?  
BATES: Run!  
(The two men run up an unguarded slope, pushing other slaves out of the way.)

**[London sewers]**

(The Doctor and Peri have found the mystery brick wall. She prods the Doctor
in the back, making him jump.)  
DOCTOR: Don't do that!  
PERI: I'm sorry, I didn't realise you were so scared.  
DOCTOR: I'm not scared. I was thinking. What do you want?  
PERI: Well, I was thinking too. You know that man we found back there, do you
think the alien killed him? And if he did, how do you think it'll respond to
us?  
DOCTOR: With gratitude. After all, I do have the means of getting it off this
planet.  
PERI: I only hope it believes you.  
DOCTOR: Well, if it doesn't, I shall beat it into submission with my charm.
Come along.  
(The Doctor is stopped in his tracks by a small knife to the throat.)  
RUSSELL: Drop it. I said, drop it, unless you want me to open up his throat.  
(Peri puts the gun on the ground. He grabs it.)  
RUSSELL: Over there. Now, who are you?  
DOCTOR: At the moment, suffice to say that this is Peri and I am known as the
Doctor.  
PERI: Hi.  
(Russell frisks the Doctor and finds Payne's gun.)  
RUSSELL: Where did you get this from?  
DOCTOR: I found it.  
RUSSELL: Oh yes? I wasn't aware it was lost.  
DOCTOR: Put another way, its former owner will have no further use for it.  
RUSSELL: Turn around. Hands on the wall.

**[Telos]**

STRATTON: We're safe.  
BATES: Safe? It was a shambles.  
STRATTON: We got away.  
BATES: Two of us. How many times have I got to tell you, it takes three to fly
the ship. When are you going to get that fact in your thick head?  
STRATTON: Now is not the time or place to argue.  
BATES: Argue? I could kill you! Why didn't you grab the head?  
STRATTON: I panicked!  
BATES: Stratton, without that head and the third member, we are as much
prisoners on Telos as if we'd stayed in the work party!

**[Cyber lair]**

GRIFFITHS: You seem to have sorted them out. Wish I had your presence of mind.  
LYTTON: Really?  
GRIFFITHS: How did you know all that stuff you told them?  
LYTTON: Perhaps it's true.  
GRIFFITHS: You said you came from Fulham.  
LYTTON: You know, Griffiths, when I look at you, I often wonder why your
ancestors bothered to climb out of the primordial slime.  
GRIFFITHS: That sounds like another insult, Mister Lytton.

**[Telos]**

(Stratton and Bates look down on the work party again.)  
BATES: I don't believe it. They're working as if nothing had happened. Why
didn't any of them try to escape? They know the situation.  
STRATTON: Maybe they know more than us, or they got more sense.  
BATES: Sense. Sense! You moron. What do you think we've been doing for the
last fortnight? We've been mining the planet with high explosive. When the
Cybermen leave they're going to destroy the surface of Telos and us with it.  
STRATTON: Let's get out of here before they come and get us.  
BATES: They won't be coming to get us. They know precisely where we're going.
Cyber Control.  
(Bates points to a construction sticking out of the highest point in the area.

**[Cyber Control]**

(Like in the lair on Earth, there are humanoids and Cybermen in alcoves around
the walls.)  
CYBERMAN: Controller.  
(The Cyber Controller has a highly domed head without the tubes to the ear
pieces. It talks slightly staccato and is more heavily built around the belly
and thighs than other Cybermen.)  
CYBERMAN: Two of the work party have escaped.  
CONTROLLER: Who are they?  
CYBERMAN: Stratton and Bates.  
CONTROLLER: That is to be expected. They will attempt to recapture their ship.  
CYBERMAN: Shall I instruct the time vessel on its return to remain in orbit.  
CONTROLLER: No, it must land. We need the ship here. It will also provide the
escapees with an incentive. There will be some scientific value in studying
how they attempt to evade their destruction.

**[London sewers]**

(Russell holds up the Doctor's new favourite tool.)  
RUSSELL: What's this, then?  
DOCTOR: A sonic lance. How much longer do we have to maintain this ridiculous
posture? We've told you all we know.  
PERI: Which is more than you have. Who are you?  
RUSSELL: Police.  
PERI: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: Can you prove that?  
RUSSELL: Put your hands back on the wall.  
(The Doctor tackles Russell, knocking him down.)  
DOCTOR: Peri, gun!  
(The Doctor retrieves his sonic lance.)  
DOCTOR: Sorry about that, but we weren't getting very far with me playing
patty-cake with the wall.  
RUSSELL: Who are you?  
DOCTOR: I've already told you. I am known as the Doctor. I'm also a Time Lord
from the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous.  
RUSSELL: You're bonkers.  
DOCTOR: That's debatable, but I'm also telling the truth. The question is, are
you?  
RUSSELL: Yes.  
DOCTOR: And what are you doing down here?  
RUSSELL: Robbing a diamond merchants.  
PERI: I thought the police were supposed to uphold the law?  
RUSSELL: Oh, they do, most of the time.  
DOCTOR: You're beginning to annoy me.  
RUSSELL: The truth wouldn't make much sense to you.  
DOCTOR: Try me. Oh, I've had enough of this. Shoot him, Peri.  
PERI: For real?  
DOCTOR: Yeah, shoot him.  
RUSSELL: You murder a police officer, you'll get thirty years.  
DOCTOR: Handful of heartbeats to a Time Lord.  
PERI: Oh, please tell him what he wants to know. I'm sure it can't be that
important.  
RUSSELL: I'm here to observe the activities of a white male suspect known as
Lytton.  
DOCTOR: Lytton? Tall, lean, dark, dark, well-spoken? The sort of man who might
shoot his mother just to keep his trigger finger supple?  
RUSSELL: It's a more colourful description, but it could be him.  
DOCTOR: Commander Lytton, late of the Dalek Task Force.  
RUSSELL: Dalek?  
DOCTOR: I should have guessed when we were attacked by those uniformed
policemen. How'd you get onto him?  
RUSSELL: What? Oh, there was a raid on an electronics firm. Some rather
specialised stuff was removed.  
PERI: I think we know where it went.  
RUSSELL: Oh. Well, you'll be pleased to hear there's a reward.  
DOCTOR: Just get on with your story.  
RUSSELL: Well, there was a whisper on the street that the job was down to
Lytton, only we'd never heard of him.  
DOCTOR: Just as if he'd come from another planet.  
RUSSELL: Huh, perhaps he might have. When we checked there was no record of
his birth, school, driving licence, tax, nothing. Under normal circumstances
we'd have just picked him up.  
DOCTOR: But you were curious. You wanted to know more about him. An act we may
all live to regret. Not only is he from another planet, but he's also a
professional killer. There.  
RUSSELL: Thank you.  
DOCTOR: Would you mind, Peri?  
PERI: Where are we going?  
DOCTOR: Back to the Tardis. It's a bit overcrowded down here.

**[Cyber lair]**

LEADER: Lytton, my scouts have located three humanoids in the tunnels.  
GRIFFITHS: Perhaps it's the old bill. They'll soon sort out this fancy dress
party.  
LEADER: What does he say?  
LYTTON: He implies it could be the police.  
LEADER: The intruders must be dealt with.  
CYBERMAN: Yes, Leader.  
LEADER: This time they must not be damaged. We cannot afford to be wasteful.
Our forces must grow in strength.

**[Cyber Control]**

CYBERMAN: Stratton and Bates have been located.  
CONTROLLER: So soon? Then give the order.

**[Telos]**

STRATTON: It's not going to work, is it? Are you planning to take the place by
storm?  
BATES: You want to stay here?  
STRATTON: I want to know what we're going to do when we get to Cyber Control.  
BATES: First we have to find another Cyber head.  
STRATTON: Why is that thing so important to you?  
BATES: Like you, this planet really depresses me.  
(He ducks down as a Cyberman patrols another gully.)  
STRATTON: What is it?  
BATES: A chance to redeem yourself. You'll be all right. We'll only get one
chance.  
(The Cyberman comes close. Stratton puts his head above the ridge.)  
STRATTON: I say! Are you looking for me?  
(The Cyberman fires as Stratton ducks down again.)  
STRATTON: Well, hurry up. I haven't got all day.  
(The Cyberman starts up the slope. As it gets to the top, Bates knocks its gun
hand off with his pipe, then Stratton takes a swipe, sending it tumbling down
the slope. They run down and Bates knocks its head off.)  
STRATTON: You're mad. Why didn't you let me use the gun on him?  
BATES: Too risky. You might have damaged it.  
STRATTON: So? Now you have a trophy.  
BATES: More than that. Once you've cleaned it out, you can wear it. As
prisoner and escort, we might just get into Cyber Control.  
STRATTON: I will not wear that thing.  
BATES: You got a better idea? Then get started.

**[Cyber Control]**

CYBERMAN: The escapees have destroyed the Cyber scout.  
CONTROLLER: That is not possible.  
CYBERMAN: It is a fact, Controller.  
CONTROLLER: They are now proving too resourceful. Alert the guard. They must
not enter Cyber Control alive.

**[London sewers]**

PERI: These tunnels all look the same to me.  
DOCTOR: This is the right way.  
RUSSELL: Which way?  
DOCTOR: Bear left. What is it?  
RUSSELL: Look for yourself.  
(The Doctor turns off his tiny torch and peers round the corner. He sees a
silver figure.)  
PERI: What is it?  
DOCTOR: A Cyberman.

**[Cyber lair]**

CYBERMAN: Leader, the instruments show time distortion nearby. Shall I
instruct the scouts to investigate?  
LEADER: At once.

**[London sewers]**

DOCTOR: It's still there.  
RUSSELL: I saw one of these things earlier. They must be all over the place.  
PERI: What are they?  
DOCTOR: A particularly unpleasant alien life form.  
PERI: Oh.  
RUSSELL: Where are you going?  
PERI: You want to fight it?  
DOCTOR: We can at least try.  
RUSSELL: What can you do with that?  
DOCTOR: Shake it up a little.  
PERI: Let's go, Doctor, please.  
DOCTOR: Wait, watch and learn.  
(He fires up his tiny sonic lance and creeps around the corner. When the
Cyberman is close enough, the Doctor jabs the lance into its chest plate. It
collapses and goes bang!)

**[Cyber lair]**

(A red light flashes on a console.)  
CYBERMAN: A Cyber scout has been destroyed.  
LEADER: The attackers must be found.  
GRIFFITHS: (Cyber-like) Getting a bit rough, is it?  
(The Cyber Leader squeezes Griffiths' head between his fists.)  
LEADER: Remain silent or you will die. Transfer the humanoids to our ship and
then seal this place. It must not be discovered. You and you will come with
me.  
(Griffiths, Lytton and the Cyberman follow the Leader out.)

**[London sewers]**

DOCTOR: At least we can fight them.  
PERI: Fight them? We need help.  
RUSSELL: We need the army.  
DOCTOR: First, we need a plan. This way.  
(They get to the junk yard entrance ladder.)  
DOCTOR: Quick, up you go.  
PERI: I'm going, I'm going.  
DOCTOR: Don't leave the pit till I get there.  
PERI [OC]: No, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: And save your breath for climbing.  
PERI [OC]: Yes, Doctor.  
(The Doctor starts up the ladder with Russell behind him.  
Meanwhile, Lytton finds the dead Cyberman and what killed him.)  
LYTTON: Sonic lance from Earth?  
CYBERMAN: An alien? That would make sense of the time distortion, Leader.  
LYTTON: I can guess who it is. I've been expecting him to return. He calls
himself the Doctor.  
LEADER: Excellent.  
LYTTON: You know of him?  
CYBERMAN: He is an enemy of the Cyber race. His capture will serve our term.  
LEADER: More so the capture of his Tardis.

**[Junk yard]**

(The policeman has freed himself from his handcuffs.)  
PERI: Cybermen?  
DOCTOR: Come on.  
(Russell looks at the organ in the yard.)  
RUSSELL: That wasn't here before.  
(The Doctor drags him inside it.)

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor enters the console room cautiously, and a Cyberman grabs him
around the throat. Russell shoots it and it drops the Doctor, then he puts two
rounds into its 'mouth' to no immediate effect. As it steps forward, its head
explodes. Russell picks up the cyber gun. The Doctor is still on the floor,
trying to recover his breath.)  
RUSSELL: How does this thing work?  
(He test fires it at the wall.)  
RUSSELL: Sorry.  
DOCTOR: Careful, there may be others.  
(A Cyberman comes through the interior door and Russell shoots it.)  
DOCTOR: Shut the main doors.  
(Peri reaches for the control but something near it goes bang!)  
PERI: Ow!  
RUSSELL: Peri, look out!  
(More Cybermen enter from inside and outside. Lytton and Griffiths also enter,
hands on heads.  
PERI: No!  
RUSSELL: No!  
PERI: No!  
(A Cyberman knocks Russell out.)  
LEADER: Destroy her. Destroy her at once.  
(A Cyberman raises his arm and Peri screams, clutching a Cyber gun.)  
PERI: No!

__**Part Two**__

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Wait! Let's discuss this, shall we?  
PERI: I agree.  
LEADER: There is nothing to discuss.  
DOCTOR: If you want my cooperation, she must live.  
LEADER: We cannot agree to bargain, Doctor. It would be unfortunate if you
were to be killed, but we should still have your Tardis.  
(The Doctor dives for the console and presses a few buttons.)  
DOCTOR: Not anymore, you don't. In precisely twenty seconds, you and it will
cease to exist.  
(The Cyber Leader sees a 20 countdown on a monitor.)  
LEADER: Release the woman.  
DOCTOR: How do I know you won't cheat and change your mind.  
LEADER: You have my word.  
DOCTOR: I'm not sure that's enough.  
LEADER: Also that of the Cyber Controller.  
DOCTOR: I thought he was destroyed.  
LEADER: No, merely damaged.  
DOCTOR: Where is he now?  
LEADER: On our home planet, Telos.  
DOCTOR: I see.  
(The countdown has reached 3.)  
PERI: Doctor!  
(The Doctor stops the countdown at 1.)  
LEADER: Correct. We can now time travel. Set the coordinates for Telos.  
(The Doctor obeys, and the small pipe organ dematerialises from the junk
yard.)

**[Telos]**

(Stratton is slowly undressing over the body of the Cyber scout they 'killed'.
He is wearing the same sort of Cyber overalls under his jacket.)  
BATES: Come on, hurry up.  
(Stratton tries and fails to put on the head.)  
BATES: You're going to have to try harder than that, Stratton.  
STRATTON: This isn't going to work.  
BATES: So you keep saying.  
STRATTON: Do I look like a Cyberman?  
(Bates puts the chest plate over Stratton's shoulders.)  
BATES: If nobody looks too close.  
STRATTON: This is fantasy. We won't convince anyone.  
BATES: Listen, you pathetic creature. All we need do is convince the guard we
are prisoner and escort. At least, until we get close enough to deal with
them.  
STRATTON: It won't work.  
BATES: You'd rather stay out here and die?  
STRATTON: No.  
(Bates puts the head on Stratton. With its trailing tubes and broken neck, it
looks rather sad.)

**[Tardis room]**

(The Doctor, Lytton, Griffiths and Peri are shut in the room where the spare
parts are.)  
DOCTOR: This is bad news. Very bad news. How can they have discovered the laws
of time?  
LYTTON: They haven't. A time vessel landed on Telos. The Cybermen were able to
capture it.  
DOCTOR: So they only have one ship?  
LYTTON: They will have two with your Tardis.  
DOCTOR: Doesn't make it any less depressing. How do you know what happened on
Telos?  
LYTTON: What does it matter? Just be grateful you're alive.  
PERI: I assume you two know each other.  
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, yes. The last time we met, he was working for the
Daleks.  
LYTTON: That wasn't out of choice. Your regeneration has made you vindictive,
Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Not at all. I've never found it difficult to despise people like you.  
LYTTON: I'm not working for the Cybermen. I'm in the same predicament as you.
Look around you.  
PERI: I think he means he's also a prisoner.  
DOCTOR: More likely a spy.  
PERI: Does it really matter? He won't learn very much, and we certainly aren't
going anywhere except Telos, wherever that is.  
GRIFFITHS: Yes, where is it? Look, I'm finding all this a bit disturbing.
Cybermen, now Daleks. Time travel in an organ.  
PERI: You'll get used to it.

**[Cyber Control]**

CYBERMAN: Control, our instruments register an irregular transmission from the
Tardis.  
CONTROLLER: Inform the Cyber Leader on board. It will be the Doctor attempting
to inform the Time Lords of his destination.  
CYBERMAN: The Time Lords will attempt to stop us.  
CONTROLLER: Whatever in their wisdom the Time Lords decide, they will be too
late. Telos will have been destroyed and we shall have the Doctor's Tardis.

**[Tardis room]**

(The Doctor is fiddling in the open roundel. Lytton offers the sonic lance.)  
LYTTON: Is this any use? I wouldn't try sticking it into the Cyber Controller.
He might snap your hand off.  
PERI: What are you trying to do?  
DOCTOR: Upset the navigational control. If I can distort the coordinates by
just a fraction of a degree  
PERI: We'd miss Telos.  
DOCTOR: Not quite.  
GRIFFITHS: What is Telos? Is no one going to tell me?  
LYTTON: I would have thought, Griffiths, even you would have managed to work
that out by now. Telos is the Cybermen's home planet.  
DOCTOR: Uh huh. Adopted planet. You'd have liked Telos, Peri, in the old days
when the Cryons were in residence. They were the indigenous population till
the Cybermen wiped them out.  
LYTTON: They had nowhere else to go.  
DOCTOR: Oh, for heaven's sake, man. The universe is littered with unpopulated
planets.  
LYTTON: But few with the facilities that Telos offered.  
DOCTOR: Well, that's hardly an excuse.  
PERI: What does he mean?  
DOCTOR: Refrigeration.  
PERI: That's a strange reason to commit genocide.  
DOCTOR: Not when you build refrigerated cities the way the Cryons did. They
had a genius for it. Mind you, they had to. They couldn't live in temperatures
above zero.  
GRIFFITHS: But why did the Cybermen need the cold?  
DOCTOR: Hibernation. They were running out of power. They needed to rest. And
whatever you may say, Lytton, they could have built their own hibernation
plant and refrigeration chambers anywhere.  
PERI: Well, why not on their own planet? I assume they had one. What's the
matter?  
GRIFFITHS: What is the matter?  
LYTTON: Yes, Doctor. What's the matter?

**[Tardis]**

CYBERMAN: Cyber Control reports that we are transmitting an irregular signal.  
LEADER: Prepare for our arrival on Telos and bring the Doctor to me.

**[Tardis room]**

DOCTOR: Mondas, the Cyber planet, was destroyed.  
LYTTON: But tell them how it was destroyed.  
DOCTOR: You're enjoying this.  
LYTTON: It's not often I have the opportunity to watch a Time Lord squirm.  
DOCTOR: It blew up.  
LYTTON: Whilst it was attacking Earth.  
GRIFFITHS: What?  
LYTTON: Tell them when.  
DOCTOR: Take no notice of him. He's just trying to unnerve you. Your planet
survived the attack.  
PERI: When did it happen?  
DOCTOR: 1986.  
GRIFFITHS: Next year? That's almost now.  
DOCTOR: You could put it that way.  
PERI: Well, you must do something. Inform Earth, tell them it's coming. I
mean, what's happening to us now must have something to do with that.  
DOCTOR: How can I do anything? I'm a prisoner.  
LYTTON: Even if he were free, he couldn't. He would transgress the laws of
time.  
PERI: You interfere continually.  
DOCTOR: Not to that extent. Even I have to be careful.  
LYTTON: The Time Lords would have him destroyed.  
DOCTOR: And that would please you. Look, don't worry. Earth survived with
minimal damage. It's an historical fact.  
LYTTON: Yes, it's now become part of the web of time in the same way that the
Cryons were destroyed.  
PERI: I'm not interested in the Cryons.  
LYTTON: Hmm. There's compassion for you.  
PERI: I didn't mean it like that. I'm confused.  
GRIFFITHS: So am I. I mean, how can a planet travel around off its orbit?  
DOCTOR: Mondas had a propulsion unit. A tribute to Cyber engineering. Though
why they should want to push a planet through space, I've no idea.  
(A Cyberman enters and points at Peri.)  
CYBERMAN: You will come with me.  
PERI: Why?  
DOCTOR: Go with him. This is no time to be difficult.  
CYBERMAN: And you will go to the console room.  
DOCTOR: Telos.

**[Cyber Control]**

(The blast doors at the entrance to the complex close, and a Cyberman flails
around.)  
CYBERMAN: There is a rogue Cyberman on level four, Controller.  
CONTROLLER: We must cease reactivation.  
CYBERMAN: We are still finding undamaged specimens in hibernation.  
CONTROLLER: But not enough to justify the heavy casualties being sustained by
our resuscitation team. Cease reactivation.  
CYBERMAN: Controller.  
CONTROLLER: And order the rogue destroyed.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: We had an agreement.  
LEADER: The woman is unharmed. Telos is cold. She must have warmer clothing. I
have kept my word but you have deceived us.  
DOCTOR: What have I done?  
(Two Cybermen grip the Doctor's shoulders and cause him great pain.)  
LEADER: You will disconnect the signal you are transmitting.  
(The Doctor is thrown against the console. He presses a sequence of buttons
then nods. The Cyber Leader casually backhands him and the Doctor staggers
back right across the room.)  
LEADER: You are foolish, Doctor. Next time, we will kill you.

**[Telos]**

STRATTON: I can't breathe.  
BATES: Leave it alone. We're too close to Cyber Control.  
STRATTON: I've got to rest for a minute.  
BATES: Cybermen aren't supposed to rest.

**[Tardis]**

(Peri has swapped her swimsuit and shorts for a bright red catsuit.)  
PERI: What happened?  
DOCTOR: A little disagreement with our tin friends.  
PERI: You look terrible.  
DOCTOR: Not half as bad as I feel.  
CYBERMAN: We are about to materialise.  
PERI: (sotto) What have you done?  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Nothing much.

**[Cyber tombs]**

(A pair of large wrought iron gates, the sort you'd find at the entrance to
the driveway of a very large house, materialise in a corridor. The Cybermen
lead their captives out.)  
GRIFFITHS: What happened to the organ?  
PERI: Do you really want to know? Oh, this place is so cold!  
DOCTOR: I'd forgotten how big they were.  
LYTTON: I can understand why they call them tombs.  
PERI: I'm pleased you two are so impressed. I find the whole place hateful.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose the atmosphere is rather rancid.  
PERI: And it's freezing cold.  
LEADER: We have materialised in the wrong place.  
DOCTOR: Really?  
LYTTON: He almost sounded concerned.  
DOCTOR: Yes. I wonder why?

**[Cyber Control]**

CONTROLLER: The Tardis must be brought here. Despatch technicians to implement
my orders.  
CYBERMAN: At once, Controller.

**[Cyber tombs]**

PERI: Oh, what is that terrible smell?  
LYTTON: Death.  
GRIFFITHS: Trust him to cheer everyone up.  
PERI: What do you mean, death?  
LYTTON: The sour, rank odour of death is unmistakable.  
PERI: They're not dead. The Cybermen are hibernating.  
DOCTOR: You know far more than you're saying.  
LYTTON: You'll find out, Doctor, all in good time.  
PERI: How can they smell? They can't be rotting, this place is freezing cold.  
LEADER: We must leave this place at once.  
DOCTOR: Why?  
LEADER: We have far to travel, and the Controller awaits your arrival.  
(A fist smashes out of one of the 'doors' and takes a Cyberman's head off.)  
LYTTON: This way.  
(Lytton and Griffiths run. A manky green Cyberman emerges.)  
DOCTOR: Run, Peri!  
(The Doctor pushes Peri to follow Lytton. The Cyber Leader moves to confront
the newcomer.)  
PERI: What about you?  
(The Cyber Leader deals with the rogue, and Peri runs. Cyber Leader turns to
the Cyberman who is holding the Doctor with a raised arm.)  
LEADER: He must not be harmed.  
CYBERMAN: What about the others, Leader?  
LEADER: They are unimportant.  
(In another corridor, Peri looks through one door and sees nothing, then goes
back one. A green slime Cyberman burst out and grabs her. She screams, and two
slender beings come out of the other door and attack it with their weapons.
They take Peri with them into the cubicle as the Cyberman groans and staggers
away.)  
PERI: No! No! No!

**[Tunnels]**

LYTTON: Come on, keep moving.  
GRIFFITHS: Just hang on a minute. I've been messed around enough today. Where
are we going?  
LYTTON: You want to get home?  
GRIFFITHS: You can say that again.  
LYTTON: That's where you're going.  
GRIFFITHS: Oh, I see. You've got a taxi waiting.  
THREST [OC]: He speaks the truth.  
GRIFFITHS: What's that?  
(One of the slender beings rises from behind a rock.)  
THREST: My name is Threst. Welcome, Lytton.  
GRIFFITHS: Does she know who you are?  
THREST: Of course. Lytton has come to help us.  
GRIFFITHS: You certainly know how to put yourself about.  
LYTTON: I was stranded on Earth. I sent out a distress call, the Cryons picked
it up.  
THREST: And we told him the Cybermen had invaded our planet.  
LYTTON: And I tricked the Cybermen into bringing us here to Telos.  
THREST: For we need Lytton's help to defeat them. We also need you.  
GRIFFITHS: Me?  
THREST: It was why you were brought here.  
LYTTON: I haven't told him yet.  
GRIFFITHS: You never did intend to do that diamond job.  
LYTTON: Would you have come if I'd told you the truth?  
GRIFFITHS: You bet I wouldn't.  
LYTTON: That, Griffiths, is why I didn't tell you.  
GRIFFITHS: That, Mister Lytton, is why two men are dead.  
LYTTON: It wasn't of my making.  
GRIFFITHS: It certainly wasn't of theirs.  
THREST: We realise this must be confusing for you, but there is a way for you
to get home. And of course, being a professional like Lytton, we realise your
time is valuable.  
GRIFFITHS: Are you winding me up?  
(Threst looks to Lytton for a translation.)  
LYTTON: Attempting to annoy.  
THREST: I hope not. We intend to pay you.  
GRIFFITHS: What can you pay me?  
LYTTON: The equivalent of two million pounds in uncut diamonds.  
(Threst gives Griffiths a small cloth bag.)  
THREST: We were surprised you wanted so little.  
LYTTON: Diamonds are common on Telos.  
GRIFFITHS: What am I supposed to do for these?  
LYTTON: Help me steal a time vessel.

**[Storeroom]**

(The Doctor is pushed inside and the door closed. Even he is starting to feel
the cold. A rather more well-endowed Cryon wearing a cape gets up from behind
some containers. Everyone say Hi! to Faith Brown hiding underneath that mask.)  
FLAST: Welcome.  
DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor.  
FLAST: My name is Flast.

**[Tunnels]**

(Griffiths puts on a rucksack.)  
GRIFFITHS: Look, what am I supposed to do? I'm none too clever behind the
wheel of a car, never mind a time vessel.  
LYTTON: Your function, as always, Griffiths, is muscle.  
THREST: And we have a crew.  
GRIFFITHS: So what do I do?  
LYTTON: Keep me alive.  
(Lytton gives Griffiths a Cyber gun.)  
GRIFFITHS: A minder?  
LYTTON: A bodyguard.  
THREST: An honourable profession.  
GRIFFITHS: But why me? Why can't one of your lot do it?  
THREST: We can only exist in temperatures below zero degrees. If I were to
venture onto the surface of the planet, I would boil.  
LYTTON: Come on, Griffiths. You're getting two million pounds for what would
be little more than a day's work.  
GRIFFITHS: But will I live to spend it?  
LYTTON: If we capture the time vessel, yes.  
GRIFFITHS: If we don't?  
LYTTON: We'll be turned into emotionless Cybermen.

**[Cryon cave]**

(Peri wakes with a start.)  
ROST: Peace, child. We mean you no harm.  
VARNE: We rescued you from the Cybermen, at no inconsiderable risk to
ourselves.  
PERI: Oh, yes. I'm sorry, I'm confused.  
ROST: You must rest, then we will talk.  
PERI: Who are you?  
ROST: My name is Rost. This is Varne.  
PERI: I'm Peri. I'm from the planet Earth.  
ROST: We know, child.  
VARNE: We are Cryons. We no longer have a planet.

**[Telos]**

STRATTON: We won't get away with this.  
BATES: Shut up!  
(A hatch opens in the ground ahead of them. The two men run back over the
ridge and hide. It is Lytton and Griffiths. They close the hatch after them.)

**[Storeroom]**

DOCTOR: I thought the Cybermen had destroyed the Cryons.  
FLAST: So did they, but as you see, some of us survived. Not many, but some.
You're looking very blue.  
DOCTOR: Do you mean depressed, or cold?  
FLAST: Ah. I think I shall enjoy your company.  
DOCTOR: Not for long, I hope. I won't last half an hour in here. It's
freezing.  
FLAST: You are, in fact, the first company I've had in some time. I honestly
thought I would die without ever seeing another humanoid face.  
DOCTOR: Enjoy me while you can. I hope not to be around for too long.  
FLAST: Ah, escape. They all talk about that for the first few minutes, then
they become depressed. It's the locked door and the armed guard that's the
unsolvable problem.  
DOCTOR: Really. Could also have something to do with the lack of support on
the part of their cellmate.  
FLAST: I hate the Cybermen more than you could ever know, and if I could do
anything to frustrate or obstruct their course, I certainly would.  
DOCTOR: It seems your people have done quite a lot already. I assume you are
responsible for the stench of death everywhere?  
FLAST: I would be happier if the Cyber Controller and the others were all
dead.  
DOCTOR: So would I, especially now that they can time travel.  
FLAST: Oh, but they can't. Not properly.  
DOCTOR: They have a ship.  
FLAST: Which they stole. They don't fully understand the principle of time.  
DOCTOR: That's reassuring.  
FLAST: I wouldn't get too excited.  
DOCTOR: I rarely do.  
FLAST: Because what they have in mind will undoubtedly distress you.  
DOCTOR: Well, tell me gently.  
FLAST: They intend to change history.  
DOCTOR: They can't! It's against all the laws of time!  
FLAST: Then perhaps you should tell them, because if you don't, they intend to
prevent Mondas from being destroyed.

**[Cyber Control]**

(A detonator switch is turned to ready.)  
CYBERMAN: All charges on the surface of the planet are set and primed.  
CONTROLLER: Excellent. Instruct the technicians the Tardis must be brought
here as soon as possible.

**[Telos]**

GRIFFITHS: This place is enormous. We'll never find them out here.  
LYTTON: Yes, we will.  
GRIFFITHS: That thing. What does it do?  
LYTTON: It detects Cybermen, and there are two very close.  
BATES: That's right. Don't turn round. Throw the gun down. Now the bag.  
(Griffiths obeys.)  
BATES: You're looking for us?  
LYTTON: If you're Bates and Stratton, yes.  
BATES: So you found us.  
LYTTON: I think we can help each other.  
BATES: Really?  
(Bates frisks Griffiths.)  
BATES: He's flesh and blood.  
GRIFFITHS: What's he talking about?  
(Bates checks Lytton.)  
BATES: This one too.  
GRIFFITHS: Are they Cybermen?  
LYTTON: Almost.  
BATES: This is what the Cybermen do to you.  
(Bates pulls off a glove to reveal a cybernetic arm. He uses it to squeeze
Griffiths' hand.)  
GRIFFITHS: How much of you?  
BATES: Arms and legs. Their conditioning process doesn't always work.  
GRIFFITHS: You're sort of rejects.  
BATES: That's one way of putting it.  
GRIFFITHS: Will they do that to us?  
LYTTON: If they find us. But we won't be here. Like you, we want to steal the
time vessel.  
BATES: We don't need you.  
LYTTON: The time vessel needs a crew of three, at minimum. Now, there are two
of us and there are two of you. I don't know how you intend to get onto the
landing pad, but I have a safe route. Through Cyber Control.  
(Bates snatches the small computer from Lytton.)  
BATES: Where'd you get this from?  
LYTTON: The Cryons.

**[Cryon cave]**

PERI: Look, I know you're busy  
ROST + VARNE: Come, child.  
ROST: You should be resting.  
PERI: There isn't time. I have a friend, the Doctor. He's a prisoner of the
Cybermen.  
ROST + VARNE: We know. And we know what you're about to ask.  
(There is a picture of the Doctor being pushed into the storeroom on a
monitor.)  
ROST: Rescue is out of the question. We cannot go into Cyber Control. It is
far too warm for us. We would boil and die.  
PERI: But the Doctor, he's a man of enormous resourcefulness. He could help.
How did you know that was the Doctor? I arrived with three men.  
ROST: You never were very bright.  
VARNE: You should have killed her, then I wouldn't need to be. Anyway, she
can't use the information.  
PERI: You know Lytton, don't you.  
BOTH: We do, child.  
PERI: The man's a criminal.  
VARNE: Which is an excellent qualification for what he has to do.  
PERI: He's working for you? I don't understand this. What can he do?  
VARNE: Prevent the Cybermen leaving Telos.  
PERI: But I thought you would have been glad to see them go.  
ROST: On their departure they will attempt to destroy our planet.  
PERI: But that's pointless.  
VARNE: Nothing the Cybermen do is pointless. They want to study the effect of
the explosion on the planet's atmosphere.  
PERI: I see.  
ROST: Not fully, child. The Cybermen want to change history  
VARNE: It's the only way their race can survive. To do that, they must destroy
Earth.  
PERI: What!  
ROST: You see, it was their encounter with Earth that brought about the
destruction of their own planet, Mondas. For Mondas to survive, Earth must be
destroyed.

**[Cyber Control]**

CYBERMAN: Our scouts have located the entrance to Cyber Control Stratton and
Bates have used.  
LEADER: Instruct the scouts to follow and destroy the SVPs at once.

**[Storeroom]**

(The Doctor is running on the spot to try and keep warm.)  
DOCTOR: Mondas? Oh, I think my blood's beginning to congeal. Are you sure
about this?  
FLAST: Oh yes, I'm sure.  
DOCTOR: How do they intend to destroy Earth?  
FLAST: It would only be necessary to disrupt it.  
DOCTOR: It would still take rather a large bomb.  
FLAST: They have one. A natural one. In fact, it's heading towards Earth at
this very moment.  
DOCTOR: Halley's comet?  
FLAST: That's right. They plan to divert it, cause it to crash into Earth.
It'll make a very loud bang.  
DOCTOR: Indeed it will. It'll also bring about a massive change in established
history. The Time Lords would never allow it.  
FLAST: Who knows? Perhaps their agents are already at work.  
DOCTOR: Well, if they are, they're taking their time about it. For a start,
why? Wait a minute. No! Nos, not me! (shouts at the sky) You haven't
manoeuvred me into this mess just so I can get you out of it! It would have
helped if I had known what was going on!  
FLAST: You are a Time Lord?  
DOCTOR: Yes. And at the moment, a rather angry one.  
FLAST: I want to see the Cybermen dealt with as much as the Time Lords do.  
DOCTOR: Oh? But surely, it must have occurred to you that if Mondas hadn't
been destroyed, the Cybermen would never have come here.  
FLAST: Of course, but my people have accepted their fate. Your problem is to
convince the Cybermen of theirs. I think I can help you. I managed to open one
of these, but I couldn't do anything with it.  
(She takes the Doctor to a pile of silver ammunition boxes.)  
DOCTOR: What is it?  
(It is full of white powder.)  
FLAST: Vastial. It's a mineral, very common in the colder areas of Telos. It's
also very unstable. In fact, you have enough in your hand to blow it off. At
this temperature, though, it's quite safe, quite useless, otherwise the
Cybermen would hardly have locked us in here with it.  
DOCTOR: How warm does it have to get before it becomes unfriendly?  
FLAST: Ten degrees above zero. Fifteen, and it self-ignites.

**[Cyber Control tunnel]**

GRIFFITHS: Over here?  
LYTTON: Up there. Gun? I'll keep you covered.  
(Lytton swaps the computer map for Stratton's Cyber gun.)  
LYTTON: Now move.  
(Griffiths leads Bates and Stratton up a ladder. Lytton is about to follow
when a Cyberman grabs his ankle.)  
LYTTON: Help!

**[Top of ladder]**

BATES: There's nothing we can do to help him. Are you coming?

**[Storeroom]**

FLAST: Even if you can get the door open, the guard in the corridor is armed.  
DOCTOR: So you said. And so are we.  
FLAST: But we're in here and he's out there.  
DOCTOR: First things first. How much of this stuff do we need to destroy the
guard?  
FLAST: Very little.  
(The Doctor uses a scoop to get some of the vastial out of the box and take it
to Flast.)  
DOCTOR: Now, you're sure this will explode on contact with warm air?  
FLAST: Of course, but how will you get it out of here?  
DOCTOR: Wait, watch and learn.  
(He switches on his sonic lance and starts on the door controls.)  
DOCTOR: If I do get it open, what happens to you? You can't leave here. The
warmth in the corridor will kill you.  
FLAST: Destroy the guard first, then we'll discuss it.  
(The door slides open a little way. The Doctor puts the scoop of vastial out
in the corridor and closes it again. The Cyberman walks over and reaches down
for the scoop. BANG! Fire runs up its cyber arm before its chest plate
explodes.)  
DOCTOR: When they learn about this, they'll kill you.  
FLAST: They'll simply complete a job they started some time ago. That is what
I've been waiting for, Time Lord.  
(The Doctor looks at his sonic lance.)  
FLAST: There is enough explosive in here to annihilate Cyber Control.  
DOCTOR: Well, there's not much power left in this lance, and that stuff is
very cold. It may not generate enough heat.  
(The Doctor gives Flast the sonic lance.)  
FLAST: The Cybermen will not leave Telos.

**[Tunnels]**

ROST: You must wait here, child. There will be a guard on the Tardis.  
PERI: It won't work. I can't operate the controls. If I try to move the
Tardis, anything could happen.  
VARNE: We said we'd help you.  
PERI: I don't think you realise how temperamental that machine is. I mean,
even the Doctor has problems piloting it.  
(Varne's belt communicator beeps.)  
VARNE: Varne.

**[Cryon cave]**

THREST: Lytton has been taken prisoner.

**[Tunnels]**

ROST: The Tardis must be moved.  
(The Doctor is running past the Cyber tombs.)

**[Cyber Control]**

CONTROLLER: You have wasted both our time and energy. I know that you plan to
steal or destroy my time vessel. You will tell me how it is to be done.  
(Lytton stays silent, so two Cybermen take hold of his hands and squeeze.
Blood pours down them and he falls to the floor, screaming.)

**[Cyber tombs]**

(Rost takes a careful look around the corner to where the Tardis is parked,
then returns.)  
ROST: There is a guard. There may be others inside.  
PERI: Well, don't look at me. I'm not going in after them.

**[Cyber Control]**

CONTROLLER: You are foolish, Lytton. You could have saved yourself from pain.
I told you you would tell us everything. Now you will become as we are.  
CYBERMAN: The time vessel is approaching Telos, Controller.  
CONTROLLER: Excellent. Order it to land and have the Doctor brought to me.  
CYBERMAN: Controller. (beep) The Cyberman guarding the Doctor does not
respond.  
CONTROLLER: Show him to me.  
(The monitor shows the open storeroom door.)  
CONTROLLER: The Doctor has escaped. He must be found.  
(Flast switches on the sonic lance, places it in a box of vastial and closes
the lid. She watches the steam drift out of it.  
Meanwhile, Bates, Stratton and Griffiths hear the time vessel lands on the
roof of Cyber Control above them.)

**[Cyber tombs]**

(The Doctor discovers the guard on the Tardis and retreats into a gun held by
a Cryon.)  
DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor.  
VARNE: Unless you help us, you won't be for very much longer.  
(Peri, Rost and another Cryon come out of a tomb.)  
PERI: Doctor, you escaped. You've got to help me. They want to destroy the
Tardis.  
DOCTOR: Well, that's not very friendly.  
ROST: It would be more accurate to say that we do not wish the Cybermen to
control it.  
DOCTOR: Well, there at least we agree. How many Cybermen are inside the
Tardis?  
VARNE: We have no way of telling.  
DOCTOR: Then we must find out.  
(He tries to shoulder his way into a tomb, and fails.)  
DOCTOR: Do you mind?  
(Varne uses her gun to blast the door.)

**[Cyber tomb]**

(A green, dead, Cyberman lies on the floor. The Doctor goes to its head.)  
PERI: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Cybermen have an inbuilt distress signal.  
PERI: But this thing's dead.  
(The Doctor opens its faceplate.)  
DOCTOR: The signal is mechanical, not organic. There may be enough power left
in this battery to transmit.  
PERI: And achieve what?  
DOCTOR: A reaction from those inside the Tardis. The Cybermen have one
weakness. They'll react to the distress of their own kind. When I was a
prisoner in Cyber Control, I met a friend of yours.  
VARNE: Flast? But we thought she was dead.  
DOCTOR: If she isn't now, she soon will be. She's at the moment the living
detonator of a bomb that could go off at any second and kill us all.  
(The Cyberman's distress signal works.)

**[Storeroom]**

LEADER: Search the room. The Doctor may have interfered with the vastial.  
CYBERMAN: Leader.  
(They've found Flast.)  
LEADER: How long has the Doctor been gone?  
FLAST: I don't know. I don't have an instrument for measuring time.  
(Two Cybermen grab her shoulders.)  
LEADER: You will answer my questions.  
FLAST: I will not.  
LEADER: Very well, take her outside.  
(They push Flast into the corridor, where steam starts to come off her as she
writhes until she dies.)

**[Outside the launch pad]**

BATES: According to the map, the launching pad is on the other side of this
door.  
STRATTON: We made it!  
GRIFFITHS: Let's get aboard the ship before we open the champagne.  
BATES: Give me that thing. Ready?  
(Bates takes the Cyber gun from Griffiths, then is suddenly pulled against the
door, where he screams and dies. Then the door opens, and a Cyberman shoots
Stratton and Griffiths in the back as they try to run away.)

**[Cyber Control]**

(Lytton is undergoing Cyber conversion in an alcove.)  
CYBERMAN: The intruders have been destroyed.  
CONTROLLER: Excellent. You will all accompany me.  
(In the storeroom, Cybermen are packing up some items into a trolley, while
the vastial is quietly heating up by the far wall.)

**[Cyber tombs]**

(The Doctor sees another Cyberman come out of the Tardis. He goes back to the
Cryons and Peri.)  
DOCTOR: Are you ready?  
ROST: Yes.  
DOCTOR: There are two of them. This way.  
(They hide behind pillars. As the Cybermen approach the area of the distress
signal, Rost shoots one of them with her Cyber gun. Varne steps out to get the
other, but is killed herself, so Threst (I think) kills the Cyberman.)  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.  
ROST: Please remove your Tardis from Telos before you have to be rescued
again.  
DOCTOR: What about you, Rost?  
ROST: We shall survive.  
PERI: But Doctor, what about Lytton?  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
PERI: He's been captured by the Cybermen.  
DOCTOR: That should make him happy.  
PERI: You don't understand. He's working for the Cryons.  
DOCTOR: For you?  
ROST: Yes, for us.  
PERI: Well, you can't just let him die.  
DOCTOR: Where's he likely to be now?  
ROST: In the laboratory.  
DOCTOR: I'll see what I can do. Good luck.  
ROST: And to you, Doctor.

**[Storeroom]**

CONTROLLER: Hurry.  
CYBERMAN: Controller, the technicians at the Doctor's Tardis do not respond to
our call.  
CONTROLLER: That is not possible.  
CYBERMAN: Instruments also indicate time disturbance.  
CONTROLLER: The Tardis has been moved.

**[Cyber Control]**

(Lytton watches a blue police box materialise in the room. There are no
complete Cybermen present. The Doctor comes out and goes over to him.)  
LYTTON: I know you.  
DOCTOR: That's right. And I'm just beginning to find out about you.  
LYTTON: Did you put the sonic lance to good use?  
DOCTOR: I did. Why didn't you say something?  
LYTTON: Now you must kill me.  
DOCTOR: I can help you. Hang on.  
LYTTON: The drug is affecting my brain. Irreversible damage.  
(The Doctor takes a sharp instrument from a computer console.)  
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. I'll tell you if its irreversible or not. Now just
hang on.  
LYTTON: I did my best. I kept my word.  
(The Doctor starts trying to disconnect Lytton from the alcove systems.)  
DOCTOR: I know.  
LYTTON: Please, Doctor. Kill me.  
(The Cyber Controller enters, weapon ready.)  
CONTROLLER: Move away from him, Doctor.  
(The Doctor puts the knife in Lytton's hand.)  
CONTROLLER: Emotion is a weakness.  
DOCTOR: I don't think so.  
CONTROLLER: It brought you back for your friend and it will cost you your
life.  
(The Controller comes closer. Lytton stabs it in the arm, severing a fluid
tube. Green spurts everywhere as Lytton stabs again and again. The Doctor
scrambles for the Controller's gun and shoots a Cyberman who enters the room.
It spins round into the one behind it and the Doctor shoots it, too. Then the
Controller starts flailing around, knocking the Doctor across the room. He
grabs another gun and shoots it. The Controller's chest plate explodes
satisfactorily. Peri has watched all this on the scanner. She comes out and
joins the Doctor by the fallen Lytton.)  
DOCTOR: I must help him.  
PERI: It's too late, Doctor. He's dead.  
DOCTOR: I can't just leave him.  
PERI: You must. There's nothing you can do.  
DOCTOR: Why didn't he say something?  
PERI: You never gave him a chance.  
(The Doctor hustles Peri into the Tardis and it dematerialises. The Cybermen
discover the smouldering box of explosive just before it goes off, and the
whole of Cyber Control goes KaBOOM!)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: It didn't go very well, did it?  
PERI: Earth's safe. So is history and the web of time.  
DOCTOR: I meant on a personal level. I don't think I've ever misjudged anybody
quite as badly as I did Lytton.
