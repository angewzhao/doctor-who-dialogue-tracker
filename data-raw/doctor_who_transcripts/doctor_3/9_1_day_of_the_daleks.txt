Original Airdate: 1 Jan, 1972  

__**Episode One**__

**[Hallway]**

(It is evening. In a grand old house complete with tapestries on the wall and
long case clock ticking away the decades, a UNIT soldier stands guard. An
efficient middle-aged woman speaks to him.)  
PAGET: You will be sure that nobody disturbs him, won't you?  
(Miss Paget goes up the stairs.)

**[Study]**

(Sir Reginald Styles, a silver-haired man, sits at his desk, writing with a
proper fountain pen and using a blotter. A breeze blows the curtains and he
goes over to discover a man in camouflage dress with a non-contemporary
weapon.)  
STYLES: What the?  
(The intruder pushes Styles until he is lying across the back of a
chesterfield.)  
STYLES: Ah, no, no! No!  
(Just as it seems Styles is about to be shot, there is a strange light and
sound effect, and the intruder vanishes. Miss Paget enters.)  
PAGET: Sir Reginald? Are you all right? What happened?  
STYLES: He attacked me. Tried to kill me.  
PAGET: Who did? What happened?  
STYLES: He vanished. Disappeared into thin air, like a ghost.  
(The French windows are open.)

**[UNIT Office]**

(The Brigadier answers the telephone.)  
BRIGADIER: Lethbridge-Stewart?  
MAN [OC]: Ah. I have the Minister for you.  
MINISTER [OC]: Hello?  
BRIGADIER: Oh, good. Put him through, will you?  
MINISTER [OC]: Hello? Hello?  
BRIGADIER: Good morning, Minister.  
MINISTER [OC]: I've just been on to Auderly House. I've rather had some rather
disturbing news.  
BRIGADIER: Yes. Yes, I've seen the report from Miss er, Miss Paget. It doesn't
seem to be very much to go on.  
MINISTER [OC]: I don't need to tell you how critical the situation is.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, Minister. I'm very well aware of Sir Reginald's importance in
these negotiations.  
MINISTER [OC]: Then you're proposing to do nothing about it.  
BRIGADIER: No, Minister. I do not propose to ignore the matter. I'm putting my
best man onto it. As a matter of fact, I was just about to brief him when you
rang.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(The Doctor has the Tardis console in the room and is working on the
dematerialisation circuit, as usual.)  
JO: Doctor, why don't you take a break?  
DOCTOR: It's maddening, you know. So nearly there. If I could only cut out
their override on the dematerialisation circuit. Let me see those figures.  
JO: Doctor? I thought the Tardis was working again.  
DOCTOR: What gave you that idea?  
JO: Oh, being dragged off to an alien planet five hundred years in the future,
for example. Oh, you know, all that business with the miners and the
colonists.  
DOCTOR: My dear Jo, the Tardis was being operated then under remote control by
the High Council of the Time Lords.  
JO: Well, if it worked for them.  
DOCTOR: I don't want it to work for them. I want it to work for me. No one's
going to turn me into an interplanetary puppet. Yes, of course. Why didn't I
think of that before?  
(The Doctor goes underneath the console. A moment later the doors to the lab
open and a second Doctor and Jo are standing there.)  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, of course, I remember now. Look, don't worry, my dear. I know
you're alarmed but you needn't be.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well I think that should do it. Why on Earth I never realised
that.  
(Then the Doctor sees himself standing there.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, no. What are you doing here?  
DOCTOR 2: Well, I'm not here. Don't worry. Well, that is, in a sense I am
here, but you are not there. Yes, well, it's a bit difficult to explain
really.  
DOCTOR: This won't do at all. We can't have two of us running about.  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, well don't worry. It will all sort itself  
(Flash, bang from the console and the duplicates vanish.)  
JO: Doctor? What happened?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's a very complicated thing, time, Jo. Once you've begun
tampering with it, the oddest things start happening.  
JO: But there was another you and another me. Well, where've they gone?  
DOCTOR: Back into their own time stream, of course. Or do I mean forward?  
JO: But, Doctor, I don't understand.  
DOCTOR: Look, Jo, don't worry about it. It was a freak affect. It's very
unlikely to happen again. Hold that and give me those papers.  
(The Brigadier enters.)  
BRIGADIER: Ah, Doctor. Glad you're still here. I need your help.  
DOCTOR: Sorry, Brigadier. I'm busy.  
BRIGADIER: Yeah, so am I, Doctor, so am I. Now then, you've heard of Sir
Reginald Styles?  
DOCTOR: No, can't say that I have.  
JO: Well, isn't he the chief representative at the UN?  
BRIGADIER: That's right. Key figure at the latest summit conference.  
DOCTOR: My dear chap, I'm a scientist, not a politician.  
BRIGADIER: You know, Doctor, if you didn't spend so much time tinkering around
with this wretched contraption, you'd realise just how bad the international
situation's become.  
DOCTOR: Humans are always squabbling over something, Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, this particular squabble looks like ending up in a third
world war. The Chinese delegation have refused to attend. Without them, the
conference can't even begin. Now Styles is flying to Peking in a few hours.
There's just a chance that he can persuade them to change their minds.  
DOCTOR: All right, Brigadier. So what's his problem?  
BRIGADIER: Well, he was working late last night, down at Auderly.  
JO: Where's that?  
BRIGADIER: Auderly, Miss Grant, is a Government owned country house about
fifty miles north of London where the conference is due to be held.  
JO: Oh.  
BRIGADIER: He suddenly started behaving rather oddly. Seemed to think that
someone was trying to assassinate him.  
DOCTOR: Any idea who?  
BRIGADIER: Some sort of ghost, apparently.

**[Auderly]**

(The peace of the lawns near the house is disturbed by the light and sound
effect of the previous night, which this time deposits a man in the middle of
the meadow. He runs for cover, looks towards the house then flees as a strange
sound starts up. \- note, this is Dropmore House in Buckinghamshire, which was
almost destroyed by fires twice in the 1990s. He runs along a path to a
railway bridge over a canal. Suddenly a large grey-skinned alien with heavy
brows and jaw knocks him down the slope. The alien and his companion walk down
the slope, see that the man is unconscious, then go into a tunnel under the
bridge.)

**[Study]**

PAGET: He said somebody attacked him and vanished.  
DOCTOR: And you're absolutely certain that he used the word ghost?  
PAGET: Oh yes. But afterwards he  
(Styles enters.)  
STYLES: Miss Paget. What's going on here?  
PAGET: These people are from UNIT, sir.  
STYLES: Who asked them to come here?  
PAGET: I did, because of what happened yesterday.  
STYLES: Nothing happened yesterday.  
BRIGADIER: There seems to have been some sort of incident, Sir Reginald?  
STYLES: Nothing of any importance.  
JO: Well, if you could tell us what happened?  
STYLES: I was working late. I must have dropped off. Freak gust of wind blew
some papers off my desk. I woke up rather confused. I was picking up the
papers when Miss Paget came in.  
BRIGADIER: But you did mention ghosts.  
STYLES: Did I? Must have been having a nightmare.  
PAGET: But the French windows were shut. I closed them before I went to bed.  
STYLES: Then I must have opened them.  
DOCTOR: Did you also make those marks on the floor over there? Muddy feet, Sir
Reginald. Someone was in here, you know.  
STYLES: Are you accusing me of lying, sir?  
BRIGADIER: Sir Reginald, you've obviously been under considerable strain
recently. Were you feeling at all unwell last night?  
STYLES: I felt, and feel, perfectly well. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've a lot
to do. I'm due at the airport in an hour.  
BRIGADIER: You've no objection to my men searching the grounds?  
STYLES: None at all. Though I really don't know what you hope to find.

**[Railway bridge]**

(Soldiers, the Doctor and the Brigadier are combing the grounds thoroughly,
and two are looking over the bridge to the canal. The unconscious man is
spotted.)  
SOLDIER: He's over here!  
(Benton, the Doctor, the Brigadier and Yates go along the towpath to the man.)  
SOLDIER: Sergeant!  
(Benton leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, he's in a bad way, poor chap. You'd better get him to the
hospital.  
BRIGADIER: Captain Yates.  
YATES: Right away, sir.  
(Yates leaves. The Brigadier picks up the man's strange weapon.)  
BRIGADIER: It's a new one on me. What do you make of it, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I'm not sure.  
(Benton returns with a case on a strap.)  
BENTON: Sir?  
BRIGADIER: What've you got there, Benton?  
BENTON: I've no idea, sir. It was hidden about fifty feet inside the tunnel.
Must have been put there recently, I reckon.  
(The case is full of circuitry.)

**[Control room]**

(A man in a green high necked suit sits in a padded wrap-around chair like a
cross between Ernst Stavro Blofeld and Number Two. He is played by  Aubrey
Woods doing a good Charles Gray imitation. The decor of the room is also
mainly green, with young women sitting at various consoles. The big grey
aliens - Ogrons - enter.)  
CONTROLLER: Your report?  
(The Ogrons speak slowly, with a mouth full of large teeth. Klingonesque in a
way.)  
OGRON: We found and destroyed the enemy.  
CONTROLLER: Any complications?  
OGRON: No complications.  
CONTROLLER: Good. They will be satisfied. I did not say dismiss. I want an
intensified effort. There can be no relaxation. Not until we have found all
those responsible for this menace and eliminated them too. Now you may go.
Keep me informed of all developments.

**[Study]**

(Styles enters, and looks shocked at the sight of the strange weapon.)  
BRIGADIER: Have you seen this before?  
STYLES: Really, Brigadier. What sort of games are you playing?  
BRIGADIER: It's not a game, sir. It's our duty to protect you.  
STYLES: I don't need your protection.  
DOCTOR: Sir Reginald, we've just found a very severely injured man down by the
canal tunnel.  
STYLES: Oh really? And what did he look like?  
BRIGADIER: Thirty five-ish, average build. He was wearing a sort of guerilla
combat suit.  
DOCTOR: And carrying that gun.  
STYLES: I am very sorry, gentlemen, but I have rather more important things on
my mind at the moment. If you'll excuse me.  
BRIGADIER: I'll arrange an escort to take you to the airport, sir.  
STYLES: Thank you, but it shouldn't be necessary.  
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, sir, but I think it will.  
STYLES: Oh, if you insist.  
(Styles leaves.)  
DOCTOR: I'd like to get that gun down to the laboratory and run a few tests on
it.  
BRIGADIER: Anything else we can do?  
DOCTOR: No, not for the moment. I think we'll just have to sit and wait and
hope that our would-be assassin regains consciousness.

**[Ambulance]**

YATES: And stay with him every moment, Benton. Take down anything he says.
Anything at all.  
BENTON: Leave it to me, sir.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(The weapon has been set up in front of a firing range.)  
DOCTOR: Well, basically it's a form of ultra-sonic disintegrator.  
JO: You mean a ray gun?  
DOCTOR: That's right, Jo, I mean a ray gun. Only it's far more sophisticated
than any weapon yet invented on Earth. Now take a look at this.  
(The Doctor fires the weapon. The target vanishes in a flash of white light.)  
DOCTOR: Quite an effective little weapon, eh?  
BRIGADIER: Doctor, you say this wasn't made on Earth. Do you mean it comes
from another planet?  
DOCTOR: Well, that was my theory at first, yes, but the metallurgical analysis
shows that the iron constituent is very much of this world. In fact, it was
mined not very far from here. North Wales.  
BRIGADIER: How do you explain that?  
DOCTOR: Do you believe in ghosts, Brigadier?  
BRIGADIER: Let's be serious, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: I am.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, come along, Doctor, come along.  
DOCTOR: Oh, my mistake. I was forgetting the unimaginative nature of the
military mind. But we saw a couple of amicas seperatas a few moments ago,
didn't we, Jo?  
JO: Did we?  
DOCTOR: Yes, here in this laboratory.  
JO: Oh, you mean when we  
DOCTOR: Mind you, they were manifestations of a much more benevolent kind.
None of your clanking chains and chilly fingers, but ghosts, none the less.  
JO: That was because you were playing around with the time mechanism on the
Tardis, wasn't it?  
BRIGADIER: Still can't get it to work, eh?  
(The Doctor picks up the case the soldiers found.)  
DOCTOR: Well, I can't get this thing to work, either. But this is a form of
time machine, of a very crude kind.  
JO: How do you know?  
DOCTOR: Come over here. Look at this. Now what do you think that is?  
JO: It's a mini-dematerialisation circuit.  
DOCTOR: Top of the class, Jo. Now then, pop this in here, like that.  
(He puts the little circuit into an inset in the case.)  
DOCTOR: Now, as far as I can gather, when you push this button, it should  
(The light display starts.)  
DOCTOR: Good grief! It's working!  
(And in the ambulance, the patient vanishes from under Benton's actual nose.)

**[Control room]**

TECHNICIAN: Sir?  
CONTROLLER: What is it?  
TECHNICIAN: Time transmitter in operation, sir. Twentieth century zone.  
CONTROLLER: Can you fix the space-time coordinates?  
TECHNICIAN: I'm trying, sir, but it's very faint and erratic.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

JO: Do be careful, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: All right, Jo, all right.

**[Control room]**

CONTROLLER: Well?  
TECHNICIAN: No good, sir. There was a transference, I think, but the machine's
cut out completely.  
CONTROLLER: Continue scanning. And next time you had better be more efficient.  
(The Controller looks at a large, golden, perpetually annoyed pepperpot.)  
DALEK: Report!

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(The case has stopped working.)  
DOCTOR: Well, the thing's completely dead now.  
JO: But it was working.  
DOCTOR: Yes, it started to work. Oh, I see, yes. Yes, the temporal feedback
circuit has overloaded.  
BRIGADIER: The what's done what?  
DOCTOR: In your terms, Brigadier, the thing's blown a fuse.  
(The intercom buzzes.)  
DOCTOR: Please.  
BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart? Yes, Sergeant. Really. You're sure? Yes, I see.
All right, Sergeant, you'd better report back to Captain Yates. Goodbye. That
was Benton. He was in the ambulance with the man we found.  
DOCTOR: Well?  
BRIGADIER: Well, according to him, that man just vanished. Faded away like a
ghost.  
JO: Oh, no.  
BRIGADIER: Well, Doctor, what now?  
DOCTOR: Well, everything that happens seems to centre round Styles' house.  
BRIGADIER: Obviously.  
DOCTOR: And whoever tried to harm him will probably try again. Jo, how would
you like to spend the night in a haunted house?

**[Study]**

(Jo shuts the French windows, locking out the night. The Doctor enters with a
tray, carrying a bottle and two glasses, and a cheese board.)  
DOCTOR: You know, one thing you can be certain of with politicians, is that
whatever their political ideas, they always keep a well-stocked larder. Not to
mention the cellar.  
JO: Doctor, ought you just to help yourself like that?  
DOCTOR: Well, you heard what Miss Paget said, Jo. We were to treat the place
as our own.  
JO: I wish you hadn't sent all the servants away.  
DOCTOR: That's common sense. You can't expect a ghost to walk in a house full
of people, can you? Come on, tuck in.  
JO: Well, I'm not really hungry, thank you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Well, you ought to eat something, you know. This is likely to be a
very long night.  
(Jo jumps as a bell chimes.)  
JO: What's that?  
DOCTOR: It's a clock chiming. I say, you really ought to try this gorgonzola
cheese. It's absolutely delicious.

**[Terrace]**

(A bunch of squaddies run along the gravel path.)  
BENTON: Move!  
(Yates is reporting in on a Land Rover's R/T.)  
YATES: Hello? Hello? Greyhound to Trap One. Greyhound to Trap One. How do you
read me? Over.  
BENTON: All the lads are in position, sir.  
YATES: Thank you, Benton. Quiet so far?  
BENTON: Like a morgue.  
(The strange light starts to pulse out of the tunnel under the railway
bridge.)

**[Study]**

(The Doctor has moved on from the cheese to the wine.)  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, that's a most good humoured wine. A touch sardonic perhaps,
but not cynical. Yes, a most civilised wine. One after my own heart.

**[Hallway]**

(Jo leaves the study and starts to go up the stairs when someone enters.)  
BENTON: Everything all right, miss?  
JO: It was until you came along. You took years off my life creeping about
like that.  
BENTON: Well, I didn't want to disturb the Doc. What's he up to?  
JO: Well, at the moment, he's carrying on rather like a one man food and wine
society.  
BENTON: Oh, talking of food, you, er, you couldn't get us a bite to eat, could
you, miss? I'm famished.  
JO: Hang on.

**[Study]**

(Jo picks up the plate of cheeses and the second glass of wine.)  
DOCTOR: Jo?  
JO: All in a good cause.

**[Hallway]**

BENTON: Ah, you've saved my life.  
(But before he can even cut into a piece of cheese.)  
YATES [OC]: Sergeant Benton!  
BENTON: Sir! (sotto) No.  
YATES: Just what do you think you're up to, Benton?  
BENTON: I was just checking, sir.  
YATES: Yes, well I want you to go and check on number three patrol. Move,
Sergeant Benton.  
BENTON: Sir.  
(Benton leaves.)  
YATES: Jo, how thoughtful.  
(Yates has a drink of the wine.)  
JO: That wasn't very kind of you.  
YATES: RHIP, Jo.  
JO: Pardon?  
YATES: Rank Has Its Privileges. Thank you.

**[Study]**

DOCTOR: And what was all that about?  
JO: Feeding the troops.  
DOCTOR: Oh, quite right. Do you know, I remember saying to old Napoleon.
Boney, I said, always remember an army marches on its stomach.  
JO: Well, Mike Yates certainly does. Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Mmm?  
JO: You didn't mean what you said to the Brigadier about ghosts?  
DOCTOR: Well, there are many different kinds of ghosts, Jo. Ghosts from the
past and ghosts from the future.  
JO: Well, what kind did you have in mind?  
DOCTOR: What's more to the point is, have they got us in mind?  
(The French windows blow open.)  
JO: What  
DOCTOR: It's just the wind.  
(The Doctor closes the windows and draws the curtains.)  
DOCTOR: Look, why don't you take a nap?

**[Railway bridge]**

(The light display happens, and three figures in camouflage gear appear, two
men and a woman.)  
ANAT: (woman) We'll wait here till it's light.  
SHURA: (moustache) Time waste  
ANAT: I said, we'll wait.

**[Study]**

(Jo sleeps in a leather armchair as the Doctor works on the case. It is about
7 am. and the birds are singing.)  
DOCTOR: Wake up, Jo. It's all right. It's morning.  
JO: Nothing's happened?  
DOCTOR: No, nothing at all.  
(Apart from two UNIT soldiers patrolling the tow path getting zapped into
nothing by Shura.

**[UNIT Office]**

(The Brigadier enters, jacket unbuttoned.)  
BRIGADIER: Any chance of a cup of coffee?  
R/T OPS: (woman) The canteen's closed, sir.  
BRIGADIER: It would be. Anything?  
R/T OPS: Not a murmur, sir, all night.  
(The radio bursts into life.)  
R/T OPS: It's Geneva, sir.  
GENEVA [OC]: Emergency! Emergency! Emergency to all UNIT national HQ's. Stand
by for a special announcement.  
ANNOUNCER [OC]: Here is the latest official report. The international
situation is growing steadily worse. War now seems inevitable. As yet, there
is no further news of Sir Reginald Styles, who has flown to Peking in a last
minute attempt to persuade the Chinese to reconsider their withdrawal.  
GENEVA [OC] Observation satellites report troops massing along the Russian-
Chinese frontier. In South America and southern Asia, reports say fighting has
already broken out in many regions. All UNIT personnel are hereby placed in
maximum alert.

**[Study]**

(The Doctor is fiddling with the case again. He is watched from across the
lawn by the three strangers.)  
DOCTOR: Jo! Jo!  
(The three split up and run for the house. Shura gets in first. He sees the
case and puts his weapon down on a table. The Doctor enters with a glass.
Shura dashes for him but is knocked down with two quick Venusian karate blows.
He tries again and is pinned to the chesterfield.)  
SHURA: Please. Turn that machine off or they'll kill all of us. Please!

**[Control room]**

TECHNICIAN: Sir?  
CONTROLLER: Yes?  
TECHNICIAN: We've picked up that time transmitter again.  
CONTROLLER: You're sure?  
GIRL TECHNICIAN: Yes, sir. Same frequency, same time zone. Much stronger now.  
CONTROLLER: Right. I want the exact space-time coordinates, so whatever
happens don't lose it.  

**[Dalek Control room]**

CONTROLLER [on monitor]: We have a fix on the time transfer device. It is
operating again in the twentieth century time zone and it must be them.  
DALEK: You have obtained the space-time co-ordinates?  
CONTROLLER [on monitor]: We're trying now. The trace is much stronger this
time. There is every chance  
DALEK: You must not fail!  
CONTROLLER [on monitor]: Security forces are standing by. If we do get the
coordinates, what are your instructions?  
DALEK: Whoever is operating the time machine is an enemy of the Daleks. All
enemies of the Daleks must be destroyed! Exterminate them!  
(Two grey Daleks join in with their favourite refrain.)  
DALEKS: Exterminate them! Exterminate them! Exterminate them!

__**Episode Two**__

**[Study]**

(The Doctor still has Shura pinned down when Anat enters. Boaz has Jo in an
arm lock.)  
ANAT: Let him go. Now then, turn off that machine.

**[Dalek Control room]**

(A metal door opens and the Controller walks up to the entrance.)  
CONTROLLER: I have to report that we have lost the trace. It was operating
only a few moments.  
DALEK: We are not interested in excuses. Find them! Find them! Find them!

**[Study]**

(Shura has his weapon pointed at the back of the Doctor's head.)  
ANAT: So, you are the man. Outwardly so innocent looking but capable of such
crimes. Who would ever know?  
DOCTOR: My dear young lady, I'm afraid I haven't the slightest idea what
you're talking about.  
ANAT: You have said and done enough. The time has come for your execution.  
DOCTOR: Execution?  
ANAT: Those are our orders.  
DOCTOR: May I ask whose orders?  
ANAT: It is no concern of yours. Shura.  
JO: But he hasn't done anything! He's a scientist!  
ANAT: No last words of repentance, Sir Reginald?  
DOCTOR: No, only that you're making one fundamental mistake.  
ANAT: And that is?  
DOCTOR: A question of mistaken identity. I am not Sir Reginald Styles.  
ANAT: Is that the best you can do?  
JO: But it's true. Sir Reginald  
DOCTOR: Sir Reginald is at this moment many thousands of miles away. In
Peking, to be precise.  
ANAT: You are lying.  
DOCTOR: No, I'm not. He flew there yesterday.  
ANAT: I do not believe you.  
DOCTOR: It's all there in the paper in front of you. Why don't you take a
look?  
(Anat picks up the Financial Times from the desk, looks at it then shows it to
Shura, who nods.)  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to disappoint you. By the way, that machine of yours is a
bit antiquated, isn't it? Do you mind if I suggest some improvements and  
SHURA: Shut up!  
BOAZ: It's a trick. Kill him now.  
ANAT: If you are not Sir Reginald Styles, who are you and what are you doing
in his house?  
DOCTOR: Well, believe it or believe it not, I came here to see you.  
BOAZ: We're wasting time, Anat. Here, I'll do it.  
ANAT: Who is in command of this mission! We are soldiers, not murderers. Keep
guard outside, I'll deal with these two. I said out!  
(Boaz leaves.)  
ANAT: Now then, answer my question. Who are you and what are you doing here?

**[Outside Auderley House]**

BENTON: Two men missing, sir.  
YATES: Are you sure?  
BENTON: I'm positive. I've doubled checked and there are two men missing.  
YATES: From the patrol?  
BENTON: Yes, sir. Now, there's just one possibility. They could be in the
house. I mean, it's none too warm a day, is it, sir?  
YATES: Well, let's go and check.

**[Study]**

ANAT: Answer my question sensibly. How could you know we were coming?  
DOCTOR: Because you've already tried to kill Styles once and failed. It was
logical that you would try again.  
SHURA: And you deliberately took his place.  
DOCTOR: That's right. I wanted to talk to you.  
ANAT: Why?  
DOCTOR: To find out where you came from. And more to the point when.  
(Boaz enters.)  
BOAZ: Two soldiers approach.  
ANAT: Hide!  
(Boaz takes Jo, Shura takes the Doctor and they go into the hallway.)

**[Hallway]**

ANAT: Down there!  
BOAZ: Hurry!

**[Cellar]**

(They clatter down the stairs.)  
ANAT: Stay where you are!  
(Anat turns off the light.)

**[Hallway]**

(Anat pushes the cellar door ajar slightly to listen.)  
YATES: Doctor? Jo? Try the study, Benton.

**[Study]**

BENTON: Doctor? Anyone there?  
(Boaz puts his hand over Jo's mouth.)

**[Hallway]**

YATES: Doctor? Miss Grant?  
BENTON: What do you make of it, sir?  
YATES: Greyhound Two to

**[UNIT Office]**

YATES [OC]: Trap One.  
BRIGADIER: (into phone) I see, sir.  
YATES: Greyhound Two to Trap One.  
BRIGADIER: Well, I've already alerted my main personnel.  
R/T OPS: Trap One. Over.  
BRIGADIER: Oh yes, naturally in a national emergency, we'll liaise with the
defence forces.  
R/T OPS: I'm sorry, the Brigadier is busy at the moment.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, I'll have to go now, sir. I've got the Minister coming through
on the scrambler. Goodbye. Lethbridge Stewart?  
R/T OPS: Hang on, I'll see if I can get him.  
MAN [OC]: Ah good, I have the Minister of Defence for you.  
BRIGADIER: Right, put him through.  
R/T OPS: Captain Yates, sir, on four.  
BRIGADIER: I can't speak to him now.  
R/T OPS: He says something very odd is happening at Auderly House. If you
could have a quick word with him, sir?  
BRIGADIER: All right. Yes, what is it, Yates?  
YATES [OC]: A couple of my men missing, sir, and the Doctor and Miss Grant.
Not a sign of them.  
BRIGADIER: Look really, Yates, I've got a major international crisis on. I
really haven't got time for any  
MINISTER [OC]: Lethbridge-Stewart?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, yes, that's right.  
MINISTER [OC]: Yes, it's the Minister here.  
BRIGADIER: One moment, sir. Listen, Yates, search the grounds again or report
back to me. Out. Yes, Minister.

**[Hallway]**

YATES: Well, you heard what he said. Let's get down there.

**[Cellar]**

ANAT: Light.  
BOAZ: So what do we do now?  
ANAT: Tie them up.  
SHURA: Sit down there.  
(Anat checks that the hallway and study are empty then goes back to the
cellar. By this time the Doctor and Jo are sitting on the floor, bound and
gagged.)  
ANAT: Right, they're clear of the house. Have you finished?  
SHURA: Yes.  
ANAT: We must go. Quietly! (Shura, Anat and Boaz leave. The Doctor gets his
gag out of his mouth.)  
DOCTOR: That's better.  
JO: (muffled) What about me?  
DOCTOR: You know, I've got a good mind to let you stay like that. So much more
peaceful. In any case, even if I released you, you'd probably ask me a lot of
fool questions.  
(Jo gets her own gag out.)  
JO: I've only got one question. Who are they?  
DOCTOR: On the face of it, three rather desperate people.  
JO: Well, they're criminals. They must be.  
DOCTOR: You're prejudiced.  
JO: Well, aren't you? They tried to kill you and me.  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's not in their favour, I'll admit. You know, we shouldn't
really judge them until we find out why they're here. Well, come on, Jo. What
about trying out some of that escapology of yours?  
JO: Well, I've been trying but ropes are too tight.  
DOCTOR: I'll tell you what. Have a try at untying mine.  
JO: Okay.  
(They get back to back.)  
DOCTOR: Got them?  
JO: Where'd they come from?  
DOCTOR: Well, technologically speaking, that gun of theirs is about two
hundred years ahead of its time. Your time, that is. The twenty second century
visiting the twentieth. A planned expedition through time to meet and kill an
important politician. Now, why?  
JO: I'm the one who's supposed to be asking the questions.  
DOCTOR: He's obviously not only important to us, he's also important to them.
Or history, their history, must talk a lot about Sir Reginald Styles, I think.  
JO: You mean, they travelled back in our time to try and change history?  
DOCTOR: That's it, yes. How are you doing?  
JO: Not very well. These knots are rock hard.  
DOCTOR: Well, in that case, there's only one thing left for us to do.  
JO: I know. Wait.  
DOCTOR: You're learning, Jo.  
JO: You know, I still don't get it, that changing history bit.  
DOCTOR: Have you got a better theory?  
JO: Well, no. It just doesn't fit them. They seem more like a bunch of thugs
to me.  
DOCTOR: Fanatics, Jo, not thugs. Changing history is a very fanatical idea,
you know.

**[Control room]**

CONTROLLER: We are maintaining constant watch, but there is no sign of any
time transference module in operation.  
DALEK: All criminal elements must be tracked down and destroyed.  
CONTROLLER: Well, I am doing everything possible, but  
DALEK: They will have returned to the time zone where the first criminal was
eliminated. You will dispatch security forces to search for them.  
CONTROLLER: Of course at once. And the new equipment?  
DALEK: The Time Vortex Magnetron is set to the frequency of the module that
was traced. Anyone using that module will be diverted in the space-time vortex
and attracted here.  
CONTROLLER: But only if that particular module is used?  
DALEK: It is necessary to know the frequency.  
CONTROLLER: But surely no one will use the module? They must realise that we
can trace them.  
DALEK: Do not dispute with the Daleks! The function of the human is to obey!
Activate the Magnetron!

**[Study]**

(Anat is using her communicator.)  
ANAT: Intercept to Base. Intercept to Base. Do you coordinate? Do you
coordinate? Intercept. No good. There is a massive disturbance in the vortex.  
BOAZ: We cannot fail again. This is our last chance.  
ANAT: We must get fresh orders. The time coordinates are crucial.  
BOAZ: We cannot wait for new orders!  
SHURA: Look, why don't I return to the tunnel? There's better chance of
contact there.  
ANAT: Right, Shura. Ask them  
BOAZ: Why ask them anything? Isn't it obvious what we must do? We wait here
and kill Styles.  
ANAT: And if we are detected?  
BOAZ: We hold those two as hostages. We kill them if necessary.  
ANAT: Get alternative orders.  
SHURA: Right.  
(Shura leaves through the French windows.)  
BOAZ: You are soft, Anat. What do two lives matter when so much is at stake?

**[Railway bridge]**

(Shura hides from Benton and Yates in a Land Rover, then runs down under the
bridge. He checks on a globe device wrapped in plastic and hidden in long
grass, puts his weapon with it then gets out the communicator.)  
SHURA: ZV6 to Eagle. ZV6 to Eagle. Do you connect? Over.  
(A shadow falls across him, then an Ogron hits him, hurting Shura's arm. Shura
manages to grab his weapon and shoot the Ogron into nothingness.)

**[UNIT Office]**

BRIGADIER: What do you mean, missing?  
YATES: Well, there's not a sign of them.  
BENTON: We searched the house and the grounds, sir.  
YATES: The Doctor, Jo and a couple of my men, vanished.  
BRIGADIER: Now listen, Yates, I've been talking to the Minister. Styles seems
to have pulled it off. The Chinese have agreed to attend and the conference is
on again.  
YATES: Oh, when's it fixed for?  
BRIGADIER: Tomorrow night, so you see the spot this puts me in. (into phone)
Get me Auderly House.

**[Study]**

ANAT: Where is he?  
BOAZ: I told you, Anat.  
(A trimphone trills.)  
BOAZ: Leave it!  
ANAT: No. Suspicious. Next time the soldiers may find us. Get them up.

**[Cellar]**

DOCTOR: Jo, every choice we make changes the history of the world.  
JO: I just don't understand. I mean, why don't they go back to September the
12th if that's where they want to be. You know, have another go.  
DOCTOR: Ah, that's the Blinovitch limitation effect.  
JO: The what?  
BOAZ: On your feet, both of you!

**[UNIT Office]**

YATES: Honestly, sir. You're wasting your time. He's not there.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Hello? Hello?  
BRIGADIER: Doctor?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Lethbridge Stewart.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Ah.  
BRIGADIER: Is everything all right there?

**[Study]**

DOCTOR: Yes, fine, Brigadier. Yes, things couldn't be better.  
(Anat is holding the phone to the Doctor's ear.)  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Yates and Benton came to look for you. Said the place was
deserted.  
DOCTOR: Did they? Oh yes, we were probably down the cellar at the time. Old
Styles keeps a remarkably good selection of wines, you know.

**[UNIT Office]**

BRIGADIER: Now listen, Doctor, you're sure that everything is normal down at
that house? Because Styles is coming back there tomorrow night.

**[Study]**

DOCTOR: Look, I don't that's very wise, Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Well, why not, if everything's all right?

**[UNIT Office]**

BRIGADIER: It is all right, isn't it, Doctor? Captain Yates was very concerned
about you.

**[Study]**

DOCTOR: Yes, well, you tell Captain Yates not to worry. Everything's fine. And
tell old Styles too, and the Prime Minister.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Right.  
DOCTOR: Oh, and Brigadier?  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Yes?  
DOCTOR: Don't forget to tell it to the Marines. Goodbye.

**[UNIT Office]**

YATES: There you are, sir. I said there was something wrong.  
BRIGADIER: I'm going down to that house myself. Lay on a jeep for me, will
you? I'll meet you there later.

**[Study]**

(Unseen, Jo is trying to get her hands free.)  
ANAT: He's coming. Sir Reginald Styles is coming here.  
DOCTOR: Well, that surprises you? I should have thought with your insight into
the future. Oh no, in your case, it'd be the past, wouldn't it.  
BOAZ: The conference tomorrow night. Our dates were right after all.  
ANAT: All we have to do is to wait here until he returns and then  
(Jo gets her hands free, and grabs the little time machine case.)  
JO: Right! Drop your guns! If you don't, I'll smash this to pieces.  
DOCTOR: Jo, put that thing down. I've only just got it in working order.  
JO: I mean it.  
ANAT: Stupid child! You do not know what you are doing.  
JO: Oh yes I do. You're going to let us both out or you'll be stranded here
for ever.  
BOAZ: We don't need that machine. We have another one.  
ANAT: The man who owned that machine is dead. His body is back in our time
zone.  
JO: You're bluffing.  
ANAT: Put it down and don't be silly.  
DOCTOR: Jo, do as she says.  
(The time machine starts up.)  
BOAZ: Drop it. Drop it!  
(Too late. Jo falls through time and lands in front of the Controller and his
Ogrons.)

**[Study]**

DOCTOR: Jo? Jo! Look, can't you do anything?  
ANAT: No, it's too late.  
DOCTOR: What's happened to her?  
ANAT: Disintegrated. Dispersed around the time vortex.  
BOAZ: If she was lucky.  
DOCTOR: And if she wasn't?  
BOAZ: Re-embodied in the twenty second century.  
ANAT: Believe me, she would be better off dead.

**[Control room]**

(The Controller gives an Ogron the time device.)  
CONTROLLER: You may go.  
(The Ogrons leave.)  
CONTROLLER: You see, they're really not as terrifying as they look.  
JO: What are they?  
CONTROLLER: Ogrons. They're a form of higher anthropoid. They used to live in
scattered communities on one of the outer planets. They make very useful
servants.  
JO: Servants? What do they do?  
CONTROLLER: Oh, we use them as policemen. They're very simple, very honest,
very loyal. Do please sit down.  
(The Controller offers Jo his chair.)  
JO: Thank you. Is this really the twenty second century?  
CONTROLLER: Oh, don't worry. We can return you to your own time, but tell me
Miss, er?  
JO: Grant, Jo Grant.  
CONTROLLER: Miss Grant, these three people who attacked you. What did you make
of them?  
JO: Well, they were sort of guerillas, I suppose.  
CONTROLLER: They are cruel and ruthless fanatics.  
JO: You know who they are?  
CONTROLLER: Unfortunately, yes. But what you don't know, is how lucky you are
that they didn't get rid of you straight away.  
JO: They tried to kill the Doctor.  
CONTROLLER: He's still with them , is he, this friend of yours?  
JO: Yes, they're holding him prisoner.  
CONTROLLER: Then I am afraid he is in very grave danger.  
JO: But they've no reason to harm him. They know he's the wrong man.  
CONTROLLER: You don't know these people. We have spent years trying to track
them down. If you knew some of the terrifying crimes they have been capable
of. If anyone stands in their way, they are without mercy.  
JO: I can believe it.  
CONTROLLER: However, there is a chance that I may be able to save your friend.  
JO: Could you?  
CONTROLLER: I can try. There are means but I shall need your help.  
JO: How can I help?  
CONTROLLER: Well, first of all, I shall want to know exactly where you came
from and when.  
JO: Well, we were at Sir Reginald Styles' house, about fifty miles from
London.  
CONTROLLER: Now, you've told me the year. Can you tell me the exact date?  
JO: That's easy. It was September the 13th.  
CONTROLLER: Excellent. Now, you must be tired, you must be hungry. We do have
special guest rooms. Leave everything to me. Oh, there is one last question.
These criminals, can you tell me exactly where they entered your time? I mean,
did they manifest themselves in the house itself?  
JO: I don't think so.  
CONTROLLER: Somewhere outside the house? Some hiding place?  
JO: I don't know for sure, but there's a tunnel by a canal not far from the
house. We found that time machine there.  
CONTROLLER: A tunnel. Thank you. I'll call you as soon as we have any news.  
(Jo leaves with a woman.)  
CONTROLLER: You see? She trusts me implicitly.

**[Dalek Control room]**

DALEK: The criminals are using the tunnel as a transfer point. We will prepare
an ambush in the twentieth century time zone.  
CONTROLLER [on monitor]: We have security forces in the area. With any luck,
they will drive the guerillas straight into our hands. I shall take charge of
the operation myself.  
DALEK: I shall lead the expedition! This time there must be no mistake! The
enemies of the Daleks will be destroyed!

**[Cellar]**

(The Doctor is being tied up again.)  
ANAT: Hurry! Shura may be back!  
(Boaz leaves with Anat. The Doctor starts rubbing his ropes against the edge
of a wine rack. The sharp metal cuts it quite quickly.)

**[Study]**

ANAT: Where is he? He should be back.  
(Boaz sees Ogrons coming across the lawn.)  
BOAZ: Anat! Look!  
ANAT: Shoot!  
(They get two of the Ogrons before the others return fire, destroying the
French windows.)  
ANAT: Fall back!  
BOAZ: We can get through the library. Come!  
(Boaz is knocked over by the Doctor opening the door.)  
ANAT: Stay where you are! Boaz, get out! Boaz, come on!  
(Boaz tries to tackle the Doctor, but is easily thrown off.)  
ANAT: Come on, Boaz, out! Out, out!  
(Anat and Boaz leave. The Doctor puts on his cape as an Ogron crashes through
the remains of the French windows.)  
DOCTOR: How do you do? Hai!  
(The Doctor high-kicks the Ogron and gets its weapon, then makes a run for
it.)

**[Terrace]**

(Anat and Boaz shoot at two approaching Ogrons then run. The Doctor arrives
and makes one Ogron vanish with his weapon. The second falls in a hail of
machine gun bullets.)  
BRIGADIER: Doctor, what on earth's going on?  
DOCTOR: Thank you, Brigadier, for that timely intervention.  
BRIGADIER: Who is that creature?  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'll explain about him later. Excuse me, old chap, I'm in a
hurry.  
(The Doctor drives off in the Brigadier's Land Rover.)  
BRIGADIER: Doctor, come back at once!

**[Railway bridge]**

(Anat and Boaz run into the tunnel as the Doctor drives up. He runs after
them. Inside the tunnel there is a sound, and a Dalek appears.)

__**Episode Three**__

**[Tunnel]**

(The Doctor runs, and two grey Daleks glide after him through what turns out
to be quite a maze. Suddenly he comes upon Anat and Boaz with a time machine.)  
BOAZ: Get back! Get back!  
DOCTOR: Please, wait. I've got to talk to you.  
ANAT: Keep away!  
DALEK 2: Exterminate!  
BOAZ: You'll get caught in the time field!  
(And so he does. The three travel along a vortex to the same place, although
presumably not the same time.)  
BOAZ: We warned you.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, so you did.  
ANAT: This may come as a shock to you, but you've just travelled two hundred
years through time.  
DOCTOR: Thank you. But I'm probably more familiar with the concept of time
travel than you are. Now wait a minute. Before the time transference, I saw a
Dalek.  
BOAZ: You know of the Daleks?  
DOCTOR: Indeed I do. I know them only too well. They've been my bitterest
enemy for many years.  
BOAZ: Then you're a fool to have let yourself be brought here.  
DOCTOR: Look, I came here in order to find Miss Jo Grant.  
ANAT: I told you, she's probably dead.  
DOCTOR: But as long as there's a chance.  
BOAZ: Come on, Anat.  
DOCTOR: Wait a minute. What is my best way of finding her?  
BOAZ: That's your problem.  
ANAT: We can't just leave him.  
BOAZ: I can. Come!  
(They hear a whistling sound and footsteps in the dark.)  
ANAT: Run, Doctor. Run!  
(Anat and Boaz go one way, the Doctor ducks down a side tunnel just as Ogrons
come pounding along. The Doctor avoids being spotted by running through the
maze until he comes across a ladder leading up to a manhole cover. He goes up
and discovers that the once fine grounds of Auderly House are now an overgrown
wasteland. Underground, the Ogrons report to their masters.)  
DALEK 2: Have you found them?  
OGRON: No, they escaped.  
DALEK 2: Hunt them! Exterminate them!  
DALEKS: Exterminate them! Exterminate them!  
(Above ground, the Doctor hears the clink of metal in time with footsteps
nearby, and hides behind a ruined piece of walling. A troop of Ogrons march
past. When it is clear, the Doctor looks towards where they came from - a
cluster of white high-rise building.)

**[Dalek Control room]**

(The Controller enters.)  
DALEK: Report!  
CONTROLLER: The security guards have combed the tunnels. They've found
nothing.  
DALEK: You have failed the Daleks! You will be punished!  
CONTROLLER: The fault is not mine! Your security guards let them get away.
Those creatures are useless!  
DALEK 2: They are loyal to the Daleks.  
CONTROLLER: As loyal as they are stupid. They will never be a match for human
guerillas.  
DALEK 2: No one can succeed who opposes the Daleks.  
CONTROLLER: For every guerilla cell that you destroy, another one springs up.
They have stolen your time machines and copied them. They steal your weapons,
your explosives.  
DALEK: These criminals will be exterminated. The Daleks will destroy them.  
CONTROLLER: If only you would let me recruit more human security guards, I  
DALEK: Humans are treacherous and unreliable!  
CONTROLLER: Not all humans. I have served you faithfully.  
DALEK: Do not dispute with the Daleks! Obey without question!  
CONTROLLER: Very well. There was one curious thing. The girl referred to a
companion in her own time zone. She called him the Doctor.  
DALEK 2: Doctor? Did you say Doctor?  
CONTROLLER: He appears to have got through to our time. He was seen by the
guards.  
DALEK: The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks! He must be found at once and
exterminated!

**[Control room]**

(The Doctor's approach to the one of the white buildings is watched by a CCTV
camera. He examines a large square door with a logo above it, and it opens
inwards. Naturally, he enters.)  
DALEK 2 [OC]: Alert! Alert! Area one one seven!  
TECHNICIAN: Continue scanning.

**[Dalek Control room]**

CONTROLLER: All forces are on full alert. I can assure you that we will secure
his arrest at any moment now. I will go myself and supervise the search.  
DALEK: Wait! You have not been dismissed. There has been a drop in recent
production figures.  
CONTROLLER: That can be explained.  
DALEK: Explanations are irrelevant. Production targets must be maintained.  
CONTROLLER: We will reach the targets on the next work period.  
DALEK: For the next work period, target figures will be increased by ten
percent.  
CONTROLLER: But that's impossible! If we push the workers any further, they
will die.  
DALEK 2: Only the weak will die. Inefficient workers slow down production.
Obey the Daleks.  
CONTROLLER: Very well. We will do our best.  
DALEK: You may go.

**[Control room]**

CONTROLLER: Well?  
TECHNICIAN: We have a tracking report on that stranger.  
CONTROLLER: The Doctor?  
TECHNICIAN: He has managed to penetrate the outer perimeter of work centre one
one seven.  
CONTROLLER: Have the guards there been alerted?  
TECHNICIAN: Yes. They'll pick him up once he's inside.  
CONTROLLER: I want the work figures for centre one one seven kept separate
from general analysis. I want to take a special look at them.  
TECHNICIAN: Is there something wrong there?  
CONTROLLER: Perhaps. I want the work figures for all the factories in the
central zone fed into the work computer. The results tabulated for me
immediately.  
TECHNICIAN: Very good.  
CONTROLLER: See I get those figures.

**[Rebel cellar]**

(Another man in camouflage clothes sneaks round a ruined building and down
into its cellar.)  
BOAZ: Don't gloss over it, Anat. We failed.  
ANAT: We had no choice once our plan was known to them.  
BOAZ: If you'd listened to me, we still could have done what was needed.  
ANAT: We did all we could. Monia, our orders were to eliminate Styles, right?  
MONIA: Yes, but you failed.  
BOAZ: We could have succeeded.  
MONIA: Then why didn't you?  
ANAT: He wasn't there. Security guards found us.  
BOAZ: But Anat went soft.  
MONIA: Be quiet.  
ANAT: The trouble with you, Boaz, is  
MONIA: Both of you! We have to think now. The situation is different.  
BOAZ: As I see it, it's exactly the same. We still have a job to do.  
MONIA: No. There may be other ways. I've had a report from one of our
contacts. A girl has been captured. They're holding her prisoner at the
control centre.  
ANAT: The same girl? The one who operated the time module at Styles' house?  
MONIA: It fits your description.  
ANAT: Well, at least she's alive.  
BOAZ: In the hands of the Daleks? She won't live long.  
MONIA: Can she tell them anything?  
BOAZ: Nothing of importance. Have they picked up that Doctor yet?  
MONIA: Not yet. It's only a matter of time.

**[Work centre]**

GUARD 2: Move! Move! Come along there, you scum! Move!  
(A human is shouting at a bunch of emaciated slaves emptying gravel from
dustbins into a silo. The Doctor peers around a corner.)  
GUARD 2: All right, move! Move! Go on!  
(The Doctor moves away but has to dodge back when he sees two guards walking
towards him. An Ogron hits him over the head.)

**[Control centre suite]**

(The Controller and Jo are sitting on the floor of a large room.)  
CONTROLLER: Some more grapes, Miss Grant?  
JO: No thanks, really I couldn't. That was a fabulous meal.  
CONTROLLER: Oh, it was just a light snack, I assure you. Now later on, I have
a real treat in store for you. A banquet of genuine twentieth century food.
Because I'm afraid most people don't eat like this nowadays, we've managed to
get down the main food elements to pills and tablets.  
JO: Look, I don't want to seem ungrateful.  
CONTROLLER: Something's worrying you?  
JO: Well, you did say you might be able to get me back. To my own time, I
mean.  
CONTROLLER: Our scientists are working at it, but time travel is a very
difficult, it's a very dangerous business, you know.  
JO: The guerilla's machine got me here easily enough.  
CONTROLLER: That was a lucky fluke, I assure you, nothing else. You could just
as easily been killed.  
JO: Then what about the Doctor? You did say something about rescuing him.  
CONTROLLER: There is something I have not told you.  
JO: About the Doctor? Look, is anything wrong?  
CONTROLLER: He has been seen in our time zone with the criminals who attacked
you. Doubtless they kidnapped him.  
JO: Where is he now?  
CONTROLLER: Oh, don't worry. We're on his track. I expect news of him at any
moment now.  
JO: Can I help you find him?  
CONTROLLER: Unfortunately, no. You have to stay here for your own safety.  
JO: My safety?  
CONTROLLER: If those criminals saw you here, they might think that you had
betrayed them, and in any case they would try and harm you.  
JO: Is that why there's a guard on the door?  
CONTROLLER: Exactly. He is there simply for your protection.  
(The Technician enters.)  
CONTROLLER: If you will excuse me a moment? Well?  
TECHNICIAN: A message, sir.  
CONTROLLER: I have good news for you. We have found your friend the Doctor.  
JO: Is he all right?  
CONTROLLER: Don't worry. I can assure you he is alive and well.

**[Interrogation room]**

(A semi-conscious Doctor is put in a chair by two Ogrons.)  
GUARD: Well, perhaps now you'll tell us who you are.  
DOCTOR: You wouldn't believe me if I told you.  
GUARD: You're a spy.  
DOCTOR: Am I? Who am I spying for?  
GUARD: I'm asking the questions. I repeat. You're a spy.  
DOCTOR: That wasn't a question, that was a statement.  
GUARD: Careful. Our friends here don't get much fun.  
DOCTOR: Poor fellows. I'm sorry I can't oblige them at the moment. I'm not in
the mood for games.  
GUARD: All right! I want to know what you're doing here.  
DOCTOR: I've already told you what I'm doing here. I'm looking for a girl
called Jo Grant!  
GUARD: Who's she? Another spy?  
DOCTOR: Don't be stupid, man!  
(A grill slides up and a man dressed like the Controller, except in grey,
enters.)  
MANAGER: Well?  
GUARD: He's not exactly being cooperative.  
MANAGER: Isn't he? That's very foolish of him. Have you told him what will
happen if he doesn't cooperate?  
GUARD: I've even given him a free sample.  
MANAGER: Don't worry. Leave him to me. I know how to deal with his sort.  
GUARD: I only need a bit more time.  
MANAGER: Out!  
GUARD: All right. We'll be outside if you need us. Come.  
(The guards and Ogrons leave.)  
MANAGER: Which group are you from?  
DOCTOR: What?  
MANAGER: Quick. We haven't much time. Who sent you?  
DOCTOR: Look, nobody sent me. I'm not a spy or a guerilla. I haven't the
faintest idea what you're talking about.  
MANAGER: For heaven's sake man, I'm trying to help you. Admit it! You're a
spy!  
CONTROLLER: Is this the man?  
MANAGER: Yes, Controller.  
CONTROLLER: Then why is he being treated in this fashion? My dear Doctor, I
cannot apologise enough. I am the Controller of this region. You're a very
elusive fellow, you know. I've had quite a job in tracking you down.  
DOCTOR: Then I'm glad you finally succeeded.  
CONTROLLER: I've been looking forward to meeting you. You are an honoured
guest of our government.  
DOCTOR: You surprise me.  
CONTROLLER: I'm sorry if the Ogrons were a little uncivilised. It was all a
misunderstanding, I do assure you. The whole thing has been sorted out now.
Make sure that the Doctor is taken immediately to the guest room at regional
control.  
DOCTOR: Frankly, I don't know whether I can stand much more of your
hospitality.  
CONTROLLER: A very great friend of yours is waiting for you there.  
DOCTOR: Miss Grant?  
CONTROLLER: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Is she safe?  
CONTROLLER: Of course. Looking forward to seeing you. I shall follow later. In
the meantime, the guards will take good care of you. Please?  
(The Doctor leaves with a single escort.)  
MANAGER: What's going on? Who was he?  
CONTROLLER: That is no concern of yours.  
MANAGER: As you wish, Controller.  
CONTROLLER: What does concern you, however, is the production quota for this
factory.  
MANAGER: There have been difficulties. The workers are  
CONTROLLER: Your production figures have been consistently lower than any
other factory in the central zone.  
MANAGER: I'm sorry. Things will improve, I promise.  
CONTROLLER: Indeed they will. For the next work period, targets are to be
raised by ten percent.  
MANAGER: That's impossible! I can't do it!  
CONTROLLER: Then I shall just have to find someone who can, shan't I? And you
know what that will mean, don't you? To you and to your family.  
MANAGER: Please, I, I didn't mean it. I'll do it somehow.  
CONTROLLER: Good. We'll just regard this as a friendly warning, shall we?  
MANAGER: Thank you, Controller. You're very kind.  
(The Controller leaves and the grill closes. The Manager takes a communicator
from a box.)  
MANAGER: ZV ten to Eagle. ZV ten to Eagle. Do you connect?  
MONIA [OC]: We connect. Proceed.

**[Rebel base]**

MANAGER [OC]: Time short. They're getting suspicious. A man was here. A
stranger, caught on the grounds.  
MONIA: Identify.  
MANAGER [OC]: High intelligence. They call him Doctor. I don't know who he is,
but he's important. They're taking him to the guest suite at control.  
MONIA: Do you know why he's important?

**[Interrogation room]**

MANAGER: No. Check your source at control point  
(An Ogron hits the Manager.)  
MONIA [OC]: ZV ten? ZV ten, do you connect? ZV

**[Rebel base]**

MONIA: Ten?

**[Control centre suite]**

(The Doctor, Jo and the Controller are sitting, or in the Doctor's case,
reclining Roman style, on cushions.)  
CONTROLLER: Some more wine, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: No, thank you, no, not for me. Though I must admit, it's an excellent
vintage. Well, it's the finest I've tasted since, er, well, since we had
dinner at old Styles' house. Do you remember, Jo?  
JO: It seems a long time ago.  
DOCTOR: It was. Two hundred years to be precise. And quite frankly, I wish I
was back there now.  
CONTROLLER: Naturally, you prefer the twentieth century, Doctor. After all, it
is your own time.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I've known many times, and some of them much more pleasant than
others.  
JO: Well, I quite like it here, I must say. Everyone's been most kind.  
DOCTOR: Well, I met some people today who were far from kind.  
CONTROLLER: That was a simple mistake, Doctor, I assure you. You must not jump
to conclusions.  
DOCTOR: Well, better than jumping from the crack of a whip from some security
guard. Do you run all your factories like that, Controller?  
CONTROLLER: That was not a factory, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oh? Then what was it?  
CONTROLLER: A rehabilitation centre. A rehabilitation centre for hardened
criminals.  
DOCTOR: Including old men and women, even children?  
CONTROLLER: There will always be people who need discipline, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Now that's an old fashioned point of view, even from my standards.  
CONTROLLER: I can assure you that this planet has never been more efficiently,
more economically run. People have never been happier or more prosperous.  
DOCTOR: Then why do you need so many people to keep them under control? Don't
they like being happy and prosperous?  
JO: You're being a bit unreasonable, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Am I now?  
JO: Well, look, the Controller wants to help you.  
DOCTOR: Does he? I wonder why?  
JO: You're not on the side of the criminals, surely? They wanted to kill you.  
DOCTOR: When I meet a regime that needs to import savage alien life forms as
security guards, I begin to wonder who the real criminals are.  
JO: Those creatures aren't really savage.  
CONTROLLER: Exactly. They are simply guard dogs. They just do what I tell
them.  
DOCTOR: You mean there aren't enough humans around that will follow your
orders so blindly?  
CONTROLLER: That is not what I was saying.  
DOCTOR: Isn't it? Then what you're saying is that the entire human population
of this planet, apart from a few remarkable exceptions like yourself, are
really only fit to lead the life of a dog. Why?  
CONTROLLER: You have no right to say that!  
DOCTOR: Haven't I? Who really rules this planet of yours?  
CONTROLLER: I'm sorry, I must go. I have work to do. You will excuse me.  
(The Controller leaves.)  
JO: You shouldn't have spoken to him like that. You don't know the whole
picture.  
DOCTOR: Neither do you, Jo. Neither do you. That man is no more than a
superior slave himself. Humans don't rule this world any longer, Jo.  
JO: Then, who does?  
DOCTOR: The most evil, ruthless life form in the cosmos. The Daleks.

**[Dalek Control room]**

(The Doctor is on the large monitor, but there is no sound.)  
CONTROLLER: Is it the same man?  
DALEK: The physical appearance does not match our data.  
CONTROLLER: Then it is not your Doctor?  
DALEK: The appearance of the Doctor has changed before.  
CONTROLLER: And how will you find out?  
DALEK: We will use the mind analysis machine.

**[Control centre suite]**

DOCTOR: Right. Now, do you understand exactly what to do?  
JO: Yes, ready when you are.  
DOCTOR: Good.  
(The Doctor goes and stand to one side of the door.)  
DOCTOR: Right. Now.  
(Jo screams.)  
JO: Help! Help! Help!  
(An Ogron enters. The Doctor hits him but he doesn't fall. They trade blows
until Jo smashes the wine bottle over the Ogron's head.)  
DOCTOR: Pity. That was rather a good vintage.  
JO: What?  
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter. Come on.  
(They run outside the building where a three-wheeled buggy happens to be
standing with the keys in the ignition. The Doctor drives it away with Jo
hanging on the pillion and guards chasing after them.)

**[Dalek Control room]**

DALEK 2: The prisoners have escaped. They have broken through the outer
perimeter.  
DALEK: Find and exterminate them!  
CONTROLLER: We need them alive!  
DALEK: The prisoners will be recaptured and returned here for mind analysis!  
(The Doctor rides to the scrubland near the tunnels, but a group of Ogrons
have him going in circles over concrete foundations. Finally the front wheel
digs into a pothole and stops. The Doctor has an Ogron weapon shoved in his
ear.)

**[Rebel base]**

ANAT: Well?  
MONIA: He's captured. Taken for processing. We must rescue him.  
BOAZ: Rescue him? Are you mad? From there?  
MONIA: I say we must.  
BOAZ: Suicide.  
MONIA: Are you afraid?  
BOAZ: Me? Of course I am. I'm not a fool. What is he to us?  
MONIA: We have fresh information from one of our contacts at control centre.
He is the sworn enemy of the Daleks. He's the one man they're afraid of. Don't
you see? It's our only hope. If we don't act quickly, it may be too late.

**[Dalek Control room]**

(The Doctor is strapped down on a table. On the monitor are changing images of
his two previous incarnations.)  
DALEK: You are the Doctor! You are an enemy of the Daleks! Now you are in our
power! You will be exterminated!  
DALEKS: You will be exterminated! You will be exterminated!

__**Episode Four**__

**[Dalek Control room]**

CONTROLLER: Stop! You mustn't kill him!  
DALEK: Be silent.  
CONTROLLER: Don't you realise he can help us?  
DALEK 2: The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks. How can he help us?  
CONTROLLER: He has had contact with the guerillas. He has valuable
information.  
DALEK: You have proof of this?  
CONTROLLER: I know he's working for them. The manager of one one seven has
been proved to be a subversive agent, and the Doctor was trying to contact him
when we picked him up.  
DALEK 2: We will force the truth from him with the Mind Analysis machine.  
CONTROLLER: But look at him! You've practically killed him just getting a
simple admission of identity. He'll die before he tells you anything else.  
DALEK: What is your plan?  
CONTROLLER: Let me interrogate him.  
DALEK: Why should you be more successful?  
CONTROLLER: Because I understand human psychology. I shall be able to gain his
confidence, to put pressure on him through the girl. By the time I have
finished with him, I shall be able to crush the guerilla organisation
entirely.  
DALEK: Release him.

**[Interrogation room]**

(The grill opens.)  
JO: The Doctor! How is he?  
GUARD: Come with me.  
JO: But

**[Dalek Control room]**

(The Doctor is exhausted, and kept on his feet by two Ogrons.)  
DALEK: The Daleks have discovered the secret of time travel. We have invaded
Earth again. We have changed the pattern of history.  
DOCTOR: You won't succeed, you know.  
DALEK: The Dalek empire will spread through all planets and all times. No one
can withstand the power of the Daleks!  
CONTROLLER: Take him away.

**[Rebel base]**

(Monia puts a home-made map on a rough wooden table.)  
MONIA: Now, the control centre is here. As far as we know they're being held
prisoner in this block here.  
BOAZ: Then how do we get through?  
MONIA: The disused underground railway of the old city. There's an exit right
by this wall.  
BOAZ: Even as a ruin it has its uses.  
MONIA: Come, time is short.

**[Control centre suite]**

(The Controller is using the gentle touch again, with more bottles of wine.)  
DOCTOR: My dear man, how can I tell you what I don't know myself?  
CONTROLLER: But you were in contact with the guerillas?  
JO: But not from choice. Look, they were going to kill him. I know the Doctor
would help you if he could.  
CONTROLLER: I am trying to help him! I've already save his life.  
DOCTOR: Yes, for your own purposes.  
CONTROLLER: Look, if you do not tell me everything that manager knew about
these criminals, where they operate from, what their plans are, then the
Daleks will destroy both of you.  
DOCTOR: I don't doubt it.  
CONTROLLER: Do you value life so little?  
DOCTOR: On that contrary, I value it enormously. The Daleks will kill us
whatever we tell you.  
CONTROLLER: Not if you cooperate with them.  
DOCTOR: As you cooperate with them? Do you really think that makes any
difference?  
CONTROLLER: They can be reasonable.  
DOCTOR: Reasonable? They tolerate you as long as you're useful to them.  
CONTROLLER: I am a senior government official.  
DOCTOR: You sir, you sir, are a traitor! You're a Quisling!  
CONTROLLER: Silence! You do not understand. Nobody who did not live through
those terrible years can understand. Towards the end of the twentieth century,
a series of wars broke out. There was a hundred years of nothing but killing,
destruction. Seven eighths of the world's population was wiped out. The rest
were living in holes in the ground, starving, reduced to the level of animals.  
JO: So the Daleks saw their opportunity and took over.  
CONTROLLER: There was no power on Earth to stop them.  
DOCTOR: So, they've turned the Earth into a giant factory, with all the wealth
and minerals were looted and taken to Skaro.  
CONTROLLER: Exactly. Men who were strong enough, of course, were sent down the
mines, the rest work in factories.  
JO: Why? Why are they doing all this?  
CONTROLLER: They need a constant flow of raw materials. Their empire is
expanding.  
JO: How did you come to work for them?  
CONTROLLER: They chose a few humans to help them get things going again, to
organise the remaining population. My family have been controllers in this
area for three generations.  
DOCTOR: A family of Quisling's, eh?  
CONTROLLER: We have helped make things better for the others. We have gained
concessions. I have saved lives!  
DOCTOR: Wouldn't you have helped more by organising the fight against them?  
CONTROLLER: No one can fight against the Daleks.  
DOCTOR: That's not what your criminal guerillas seem to think, is it.  
CONTROLLER: A handful of fanatics. Most of them have been killed already. I
assure you there is nothing they can do to change things.

**[Outside Central Control]**

(A guerilla fighter jumps and Ogron and knocks it out. Anat takes on two
more.)  
DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!  
BOAZ: Anat, look out!  
(Boaz dashes forward and sticks a limpet bomb onto the Dalek's casing. It
explodes immediately, killing both it and him. More guerillas and Ogrons are
vapourised.)  
MONIA: Come, we must reach the control centre. Come!  
(Anat pauses by Boaz's body.)  
MONIA: No. Come, come!

**[Control centre suite]**

CONTROLLER: If you don't give me the information I need, there is nothing I
can do to help you.  
DOCTOR: For the last time, I tell you I haven't got any information. And quite
frankly, even if I had, I wouldn't give it to you!  
(The guerillas burst in.)  
MONIA: Right, stay where you are!  
CONTROLLER: Guards!  
MONIA: Guards? You have no guards. They're all dead.  
ANAT: Are you all right?  
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. All the better for seeing you.  
ANAT: You're coming with us. No harm must come to these two. Too much depends
on them.  
MONIA: As for you, my friend.  
DOCTOR: Put that gun down. There's no point in murdering him.  
MONIA: You don't know how much blood there is on his hands.  
DOCTOR: Nevertheless, he's not your real enemy.  
MONIA: He helped the Daleks. He's worked for them.  
DOCTOR: They would always have found someone. Now just leave him.  
ANAT: Right, let's go.

**[Railway bridge]**

YATES: We've searched everywhere, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Then search again, Yates.  
YATES: We've been through every inch of the tunnel, sir.  
BRIGADIER: And even the Doctor can't vanish into thin air. He must be
somewhere. Extend the radius of the search.  
YATES: I'll need some more men, sir.  
BRIGADIER: You can have all you want. From now on, this house is top priority.  
(A dispatch rider hands over a message.)  
BRIGADIER: (reads) Sir Reginald Styles and other delegates arriving by special
plane at RAF Manston at 1800 hours.

**[Rebel base]**

JO: But how do you know this?  
MONIA: Oh, there are books. Even during the wars, people found time to study,
to write about it.  
ANAT: What to you has not yet happened, is to us history.  
DOCTOR: This history of yours, it talks about Sir Reginald Styles?  
MONIA: Oh yeah. He pretended to be working for peace, but really he just
wanted power for himself.  
DOCTOR: So the conference he called was just a trick?  
MONIA: He managed to lure the world leaders to a remote country house, and he
pretended they needed absolute quiet if the meeting was to succeed. But then,
there was a devastating explosion.  
ANAT: And Styles was killed with the others. He must have set a bomb and mis-
timed the charge.  
MONIA: There were accusations, counter-accusations, and then the wars began.
That was the turning point.  
JO: But if this true, Sir Reginald Styles must be completely round the bend.  
DOCTOR: So, you went back into our time to kill Styles before he could carry
out his plan.  
MONIA: Right. We'd been fighting the Daleks for years, but it was hopeless.
Eventually we must lose, so we thought, what else can we do?  
ANAT: We learnt through one of our spies that the Daleks had succeeded in
creating a time machine. We even managed to steal a copy of the plans, and we
built one of our own, so that we could go back into history to the exact point
where things started to go wrong.  
MONIA: With one action, we could them. Mankind could have a chance to take a
new direction.  
ANAT: But even now, the transfer isn't always stable. People materialised in
your time and then just faded away.  
JO: The ghost that Styles saw?  
MONIA: Now, somehow the Daleks found what we were doing, and they sent Ogrons
back into your time after us and attacked one of our men.  
DOCTOR: Well, that must have been the man that we saw down by the canal
tunnel. You remember, Jo, the one who vanished from the ambulance?  
ANAT: Yes, we fixed on the tunnel as a place that was stable in your time and
in ours. We used it as a transfer point. Well, you know the rest.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, there's one thing I don't quite understand and that is why
were you so keen to rescue us? Well believe me, we're grateful, but  
MONIA: Well, you told us yourself. You're an old enemy of the Daleks.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
MONIA: Then you will help us to beat them.  
DOCTOR: What do you expect me to do?  
MONIA: Well, you can succeed where we've failed, Doctor. We want you to go
back into your own time and kill Styles.  
(The injured Shura is still in the twentieth century, skirting around the
cordon of steel the Brigadier has thrown up around Auderly House until he gets
to an outbuilding and goes inside.)  
DOCTOR: You're asking me to commit murder!  
ANAT: No! We're asking you to kill one man and prevent millions more dying.  
DOCTOR: That is still murder.  
MONIA: Isn't it worth it to save the human race from the Daleks?  
DOCTOR: Yes, but would it?  
ANAT: We've told you how it happened.  
DOCTOR: But your history could be wrong, you know? Now listen, why don't you
send us back to our time? We know the future now. Maybe there are other things
we can do?  
ANAT: Monia, we're wasting valuable time. Every minute that goes by  
MONIA: Doctor, will you help us? It's our only hope.  
JO: I still can't believe that Sir Reginald Styles is a ruthless murderer.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I agree, Jo. Vain to the point of arrogance, a trifle obstinate,
perhaps, but basically a good man. So, if it happened, how did it happen? Any
of your people still in our time zone?  
MONIA: No.  
ANAT: Oh, Shura. He left just to send a message and we never saw nor heard
from him again. We assumed he must be dead.  
(Shura has somehow made his way to the wine cellar under the main house with
the globe device that was hidden by the tunnel in episode two. He primes the
device and starts it up.)  
MONIA: Look, why are you so interested in Shura?  
DOCTOR: I'm curious, that's all.  
ANAT: Curious? Well, that's funny. Mark and Boaz got killed to save you and
you're curious.  
MONIA: Anat!  
DOCTOR: Look, please believe me, I'm completely with you about the ends. I
only disagree as to the means.  
MONIA: All right. What do you want to know?  
DOCTOR: This mission of yours to the twentieth century. What did you take with
you?  
ANAT: The usual battle gear. Radio, disintegrators.  
DOCTOR: Any sabotage equipment?  
ANAT: Only a few charges of Dalekanium.  
DOCTOR: Dalekanium?  
ANAT: It's a highly effective type of explosive. We stole the formula from the
Daleks.  
DOCTOR: Could it destroy a house?  
MONIA: What are you trying to say, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? This has happened before.  
ANAT: What has?  
DOCTOR: You went back to change history, but you didn't change anything. You
became a part of it.  
MONIA: What are you talking about?  
DOCTOR: If Styles didn't cause that explosion, somebody else did.  
ANAT: Well, obviously, but who? Shura!  
DOCTOR: Isn't that exactly what he would have done? One last suicidal attempt
to carry out his orders?  
MONIA: It's possible, I suppose.  
DOCTOR: You're trapped in a temporal paradox! Styles didn't cause that
explosion and start the wars. You did it yourselves.

**[Dalek Control room]**

DALEK: You have failed the Daleks. The Doctor has escaped.  
CONTROLLER: He will be recaptured, I swear it.  
DALEK: He must be found and destroyed.  
CONTROLLER: He will attempt to return to his own time zone. If those guerillas
are helping him, they will use the tunnel, and I am setting up an ambush.  
DALEK: If you fail us again, you will pay with your life. This is your final
chance.  
CONTROLLER: I will go and supervise the operations myself.

**[Control room]**

CONTROLLER: Is everything ready?  
GUARD: Security forces have covered the whole tunnel. Don't worry, they won't
escape a second time.

**[Future Auderly]**

(The Doctor and Jo are escorted by a troop of guerillas back to the manhole.
Monia gives the Doctor one of their time machines.)  
MONIA: Now, you are sure you know how to use it?  
DOCTOR: It seems simple enough. Bit too simple for my liking.  
MONIA: Right. We'll give you covering fire, just in case.  
DOCTOR: Good.  
JO: Take care.

**[Tunnel]**

(The Doctor and Jo set off, but are quickly caught by the Ogrons who were
waiting for them.)  
CONTROLLER: So it has ended as I said it would. Did I not tell you it was
madness to fight the Daleks?  
DOCTOR: Is it madness to want to see a world free from their rule?  
CONTROLLER: It can't be done.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, it can. And I can do it. Are you going to stop me?  
CONTROLLER: (to Ogrons) Go. I will deal with these criminals myself. I said
go!  
(The Ogrons leave.)  
CONTROLLER: If only I could be sure.  
DOCTOR: You spoke of the war, of its years of suffering and starvation. Well,
I can prevent all that happening, you know.  
CONTROLLER: You saved my life. You could have let them kill me. Go, quickly.  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Jo, come here and stand by me.  
(The Doctor operates the time machine. The whole thing has been witnessed by
the sadistic Guard, hiding round a corner.)

**[Railway bridge]**

SOLDIER: Sergeant! They're here!  
(Jo and the Doctor run out of the tunnel.)  
BENTON: This is Sergeant Benton calling UNIT HQ. Look, we've found them. Would
you get a jeep over here pronto. This way, Doctor.

**[Dalek Control room]**

CONTROLLER: I am sorry. They were too quick for us. They escaped in the
darkness.  
DALEK: You are lying! You have betrayed the Daleks!  
CONTROLLER: No. I told you before. Those security guards are no match for
humans.  
DALEK: You are a traitor to the Daleks. You must be exterminated!  
CONTROLLER: Who knows? I may have helped to exterminate you.  
(The gold Dalek fires, killing the Controller. The Guard comes forward.)  
DALEK: You have proved yourself worthy to be the new controller. But be
warned, the Daleks demand total loyalty from those who serve them.  
GUARD: Of course.  
(The Guard leaves.)  
DALEK: We must follow them into the twentieth century time zone.  
DALEK 2: The peace conference must be destroyed. War must break out.  
DALEK: The Dalek conquest of the planet Earth must not be reversed.

**[Auderly]**

(The twenty four hour media have arrived outside the house and started
broadcasting.)  
MACINTOSH: Here in the peaceful heart of England will soon take place what
could be described as the most important summit conference of this century.
The peaceful atmosphere of this Georgian house gives little indication of the
underlying tension of the occasion. A desperate, last minute attempt to stem
the rising tide of international tension that seems to be moving the great
powers towards the brink of a third world war. Arriving now is Sir Reginald
Styles, who with his team of government aides, has been working around the
clock to make this meeting possible. Sir Reginald himself, has just returned
from an eleventh hour meeting in Peking where his success in persuading the
Chinese leaders to reconsider their walk out gave the first real chance of
success to these talks. Talks, on which may well depend, the fate of the
entire world.  
(Various nationalities get out of cars and go into the house.)

**[Hallway]**

STYLES: Everything set up, Brigadier?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, sir. Although I still feel  
STYLES: We won't waste time on the formalities. We'll just get on with the
business as soon as possible.  
(The Doctor and Jo drive up to the house and run inside. The guards snap to
attention for the Doctor.)  
STYLES: Look, you're supposed to be in charge of security. Kindly get on with
your job and leave me to get on with mine.  
DOCTOR: Brigadier! Brigadier, get everybody out of this house at once.  
BRIGADIER: Where the devil have you been?  
DOCTOR: Never mind all that, just clear this house immediately.  
STYLES: What's the man talking about?  
JO: Do as he says! Look, there isn't much time!  
(Ogrons and the Daleks come out of the tunnel under the railway bridge and go
along the towpath, where they make quick work of the UNIT soldiers there.)  
DOCTOR: Look, try and use your intelligence, man, even if you are a
politician.  
STYLES: Brigadier, if you can't get this lunatic out of my way  
BRIGADIER: I know it all sounds incredible, sir, but the Doctor usually knows
what he's talking about.  
STYLES: Arranging this conference was an almost impossible task. It is no
exaggeration to say that the peace of the world depends on its success. I will
not jeopardise that success now!  
DOCTOR: Brigadier, get this man and all the delegates out of this area
immediately. Use force if you have to! Jo, you stay here.  
(The Doctor leaves.)  
BRIGADIER: Sir Reginald, please?  
STYLES: No, I will not permit it!

**[Cellar]**

DOCTOR: Shura!  
SHURA: Get out of here unless you want to die too. I must kill Styles to
prevent the war.  
DOCTOR: Shura, listen to me. Styles and all the delegates are already leaving
this house. You detonate that bomb and you'll be sacrificing yourself for
nothing.

**[Railway bridge]**

BENTON: Benton calling UNIT HQ. Benton calling UNIT HQ. We just can't hold
them, sir!

**[Hallway]**

(Gunfire can be heard outside.)  
YATES: Look, Benton, keep them back as long as you can.  
BRIGADIER: Sir Reginald, this house is under attack by a hostile force. You
will please consider yourself under my orders.  
STYLES: Brigadier, I'm warn you  
BRIGADIER: Now be quiet, sir! Captain Yates.  
YATES: Sir.  
BRIGADIER: Get Sir Reginald and all the delegates away from this area at once.
Use the front exit.  
STYLES: I absolutely refuse!  
YATES: Sir Reginald, please.  
STYLES: But my papers, the documents.  
AIDE: They're all here, sir.  
STYLES: Well, I suppose I shall have to agree, but under protest!  
YATES: This way, Sir Reginald.  
(Jo goes into the study. Outside, UNIT troops are falling back under the alien
onslaught. Mortars prove to be more effective weapons than gunfire. Out the
front the delegates return to their cars and drive away, the Russians first,
closely followed by the USA. The Daleks have made it to the terrace, and one
enters the French windows.)

**[Cellar]**

JO: Doctor! The Daleks, they're coming into the house!  
SHURA: Daleks? You're lying!  
DOCTOR: No, she's not. They've come back to make sure that their version of
history isn't changed. Is everybody out of the house?  
JO: Yes, everyone but us.  
SHURA: Get out of here. Let them come in! Leave them to me!  
JO: No, no! You must come with us!  
SHURA: You don't understand! That's Dalekanium. It's the only thing that's
effective against the Daleks.  
DOCTOR: Couldn't we set a time fuse?  
SHURA: This stuff's too unstable. There just isn't time. This is something
that I must do myself. Now get out!  
DOCTOR: Very well.
