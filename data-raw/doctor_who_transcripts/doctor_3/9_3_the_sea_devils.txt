Original Airdate: 26 Feb, 1972  

__**Episode One**__

**[SS Pevensey Castle]**

(There are screams outside the radio room. A crewman dashes in and starts
broadcasting.)  
CREWMAN: Mayday. Mayday. SS

**[Naval base radio room]**

CREWMAN [OC]: Pevensey Castle. We're being attacked!  
BOWMAN: Give your position, please. Give your position.  
(The base commander, Captain Hart, enters from outside the complex as Bowman
tries to listen through the static.)  
HART: What is it?  
BOWMAN: It's a Mayday, sir. SS Pevensey Castle, they say they're being
attacked.

**[SS Pevensey Castle]**

CREWMAN: We're abandoning ship! We're abandoning ship! Our position is  
(A scaly hand takes the microphone. The crewman backs away then screams.)

**[Boat]**

(The Doctor and Jo are being ferried to a small island in an even smaller
boat.)  
ROBBINS: That's it over there.  
(The Doctor looks through a pair of binoculars at what is really Norris Castle
on the Isle of Wight.)  
DOCTOR: There you are, Jo. That's the Master's permanent residence from now
on.  
JO: Well, let's hope he's still there.

**[Quay]**

(They moor up and walk along the jetty.)  
DOCTOR: Okay.  
ROBBINS: I'll be back in a couple of hours to take you over to the mainland.  
DOCTOR: Right.  
(Robbins wheels a small motorbike while the Doctor and Jo get into a stripped
out Citroen 2CV with no doors.)

**[Governor's office]**

(In the castle, an older man picks up the internal telephone.)  
TRENCHARD: Yes?  
BARCLAY [OC]: Main gate. Two visitors for the prisoner, sir, from UNIT. Passes
all in order, sir.  
TRENCHARD: Right, send them up.  
(The Doctor and Jo are let in through the gate and showed up to the office by
an armed guard. Trenchard is working at his desk.)  
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose we could always come back later,  
TRENCHARD: Oh, yes, of course. You'll be the chappie from UNIT.  
JO: My name's Josephine Grant. How do you do? And this is the Doctor.  
TRENCHARD: Colonel Trenchard. Delighted to meet you. Pleasant trip?  
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you.  
TRENCHARD: You're late, you know?  
JO: Yes, we were held up.  
TRENCHARD: Mmm, thought you might have sunk without trace.  
JO: Sunk?  
TRENCHARD: Happens all the time recently.  
DOCTOR: What does?  
(Trenchard gives a piece of paper to the guard, who leaves with it.)  
TRENCHARD: Ships vanishing. Makes you think, doesn't it?  
DOCTOR: It does indeed.  
TRENCHARD: Now then, passes?  
DOCTOR: Well, look, we've been through all that, actually.  
TRENCHARD: We don't take any chances here. Let's see them.  
(Jo hands them over.)  
TRENCHARD: Oh. Ah, yes, from UNIT.  
DOCTOR: That's right, yes.  
TRENCHARD: Yes. Ah, jolly good. Well, you'll be wanting to see the prisoner.  
DOCTOR: That was the general idea.  
TRENCHARD: He's an interesting chap, you know. You'll enjoy talking to him.  
DOCTOR: If ever I get the opportunity. Has he given you any trouble as yet?  
TRENCHARD: Not a bit.  
JO: You've got to be joking! He must have tried to escape?  
TRENCHARD: You've seen our security precautions. Anyway, we're on an island.  
DOCTOR: Has he tried to hypnotise any of the guards, by any chance?  
TRENCHARD: He couldn't. All our men are completely immune to hypnotism.  
JO: How can you be so sure?  
TRENCHARD: Prove it to you. (into intercom) Trenchard here. Send that new man,
Wilson, in to see the prisoner. Now then, come over here and take a look into
this screen.  
(The monitor shows the Master sitting and reading.)  
DOCTOR: My word, he's putting on weight.  
TRENCHARD: Poor chap, he can't get the exercise. Now then, watch.

**[The Master's cell]**

(Closer to a hotel room than a prison cell. There are even some carvings for
decoration. The guard enters.)  
WILSON: Mister Trenchard sent me, sir, to see if you wanted your book changed.  
MASTER: Well, that's very kind of him, but I haven't quite finished yet.  
WILSON: Right you are, sir.  
MASTER: Just a minute. You're new here, aren't you?  
WILSON: Arrived yesterday, sir.  
MASTER: Wait. Do you know who I am?  
WILSON: You're the prisoner.  
MASTER: I am the Master. Come here.  
(Wilson walks towards the Master, who rises to look him in the eyes.)  
MASTER: I am the Master and you will obey me. You understand? You will obey
me.  
WILSON: You'll let us know when you've finished with the book, sir?  
(Wilson leaves.)

**[Governor's office]**

TRENCHARD: You see?  
DOCTOR: Yes, very impressive. Perhaps we could see him now, yes?  
TRENCHARD: Certainly. This way. After you, my dear.

**[The Master's cell]**

(Trenchard leads the way along a corridor to the cell and enters. The Master
is now working out on a rowing machine.)  
TRENCHARD: Visitors for you.  
MASTER: Why, Doctor! And Miss Grant! What a very pleasant surprise.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, how are you?  
MASTER: Well, as you see, very well. Trying to keep fit.  
TRENCHARD: Yes, well, I'll leave you all together. Give the guard a shout when
you want to leave.  
DOCTOR: Thank you, Colonel.  
(Trenchard leaves.)  
MASTER: He's quite a decent sort, really. Used to be the Governor of a colony
once, so he tells me.  
DOCTOR: Very small colony, wasn't it? In fact, I believe they claimed
independence soon after he arrived.  
JO: He seems to be looking after you very well.  
MASTER: Oh, yes, I've got everything I want, except, of course, my freedom.  
DOCTOR: You can consider yourself lucky. Quite a few people were in favour of
having you executed.  
MASTER: My dear Doctor, don't think I'm not grateful. I've had a chance to
think about things while I've been in here.  
DOCTOR: Have you now?  
MASTER: I wish that something like this had happened a long time ago.  
JO: Surely you don't like being locked up?  
MASTER: No, but, it's given me a chance to reconsider my life.  
DOCTOR: Am I to take it that you're a changed man?  
(The Master washes his hands in the en-suite.)  
MASTER: Is that so very incredible? After all, I do have a great deal of which
to repent.  
JO: You're telling us.  
DOCTOR: In that case, perhaps you'd like to tell me the whereabouts of your
Tardis?  
MASTER: So that you could use it in order to escape from this planet, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: No, so that I can make absolutely certain that you can't.  
MASTER: No, I'm sorry. That is too much to ask.  
DOCTOR: Ask a silly question. Come on, Jo. I think we'd better be going. Is
there anything that I can do for you at all?  
MASTER: There is one thing. Please come in now and then to have a chat. Oh,
Trenchard's a very nice man, but his conversation is somewhat limited.  
JO: Goodbye.  
MASTER: Goodbye, Miss Grant. And goodbye, Doctor. I sincerely hope we meet
again very soon.  
(The Doctor nearly shakes the Master's hand, but turns the gesture into a
wave.)  
DOCTOR: Goodbye.  
(The Master gets back on his rowing machine, laughing.)

**[Governor's office]**

JO: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Mmm?  
JO: You felt sorry for him, didn't you. You wanted to come down here and see
that was all right.  
DOCTOR: Well, he used to be a friend of mine once. A very good friend. In
fact, you might almost say we were at school together.  
JO: How long's he going to be here?  
DOCTOR: Forever, I should think.  
(Trenchard enters.)  
TRENCHARD: Ah, ready for off, then? I'd better stamp your passes.  
DOCTOR: What, again?  
TRENCHARD: Got to be checked in and out, old man. It's the rule. Well, we
don't look after him too badly, do we?  
DOCTOR: No, indeed. But I advise you to be careful. He's a very dangerous man.  
TRENCHARD: Ah, don't worry. I keep my eye on him. There you are, my dear. Come
along now then.  
JO: Thank you.  
TRENCHARD: I'll get one of my chaps to run you down to the quayside.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.

**[The Master's cell]**

(Trenchard enters. The Master is doing a crossword. Times, probably.)  
TRENCHARD: There we are, then. Fooled them nicely, didn't we?  
MASTER: I hope so.  
TRENCHARD: What about that hypnotism wheeze, eh? That took them in.  
MASTER: Don't underestimate the Doctor. Do you really believe that he came
here to see me?  
(The Master takes a dictionary from a bookcase to help with his crossword.)  
TRENCHARD: Why else?  
MASTER: Vanishing ships, of course.  
TRENCHARD: Oh, I don't think so. No, he didn't seem particularly interested
when I mentioned it.  
MASTER: You did what!  
TRENCHARD: We were just chatting. No harm done, surely.  
MASTER: Let's hope not. By the way, what about those admiralty charts I asked
for?  
TRENCHARD: They'll be here this afternoon.  
MASTER: Ah, splendid. Er, there is one more thing.  
TRENCHARD: Yes?  
MASTER: I wonder, do you think I could have another television set? For the
bedroom.  
TRENCHARD: Yes. Yes, I'm sure that's possible.  
MASTER: Colour, of course.  
TRENCHARD: Of course! Well, if you'll excuse me?

**[Quay]**

ROBBINS: Ah, it's true. Three ships vanished. Something queer going on for all
their trying to hush it up.  
DOCTOR: Well, who's trying to hush it up?  
ROBBINS: Well, them over at the naval base. The secret research establishment.  
DOCTOR: You seem to know a great deal about all this.  
ROBBINS: Well, I'm in the lifeboat crew, aren't I? We went out to look for
survivors. Only found the one lifeboat, capsized. The bottom was all charred
in a sort of pattern.  
DOCTOR: Well, where's this boat now?  
ROBBINS: Ah, the navy took it. Told us to keep our mouths shut.  
DOCTOR: Well, where's this naval base, then?  
ROBBINS: Over beyond the headland.  
DOCTOR: Right, well, perhaps you'd like to take me there straight away.  
ROBBINS: Mister Trenchard paid me to bring you out here and take you back. You
want to go over to the naval base, then you make your own arrangements.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, you're probably perfectly right. Look, er, I wonder whether
you'd like to go and see what's happening to my young friend? She said she was
going to buy some picture postcards.  
(The Doctor holds up a note of the realm.)  
ROBBINS: I don't mind.  
DOCTOR: I'd go myself, only my bad leg's playing me up a bit. The Crimea, you
know.  
ROBBINS: I see. Crimea?  
DOCTOR: Oh, Gallipoli? El Alamein? Does it really matter?  
ROBBINS: I reckon not.  
(Robbins takes the money and leaves. The Doctor unties the little boat, starts
up the engine and chugs away.)

**[Hart's office]**

(At HMS Seaspite Naval Research Establishment, Captain Hart is giving
dictation to his secretary, a young Wren.)  
HART: And I regret to inform your Lordships that our investigations have
failed to reveal any clue as to the cause of the sinkings, full stop. The
charred ship's lifeboat will be sent to our laboratory at HMS Vernon
Portsmouth for investigation and analysis. Meanwhile, we are keeping careful
watch.  
BLYTHE: Yes, sir?  
HART: Come and look at this. What on Earth?  
(The Doctor is steering the boat up onto the beach.)  
BLYTHE: Perhaps he's lost, sir.  
HART: This place is supposed to be top secret. People treating it like
Brighton beach.  
(Hart picks up a telephone.)  
HART: Get me the Master at Arms. Captain Hart here. I don't know whether
you've noticed but there happens to be a stray civilian chugging into the
base! Get on to it, will you?  
BLYTHE: Sir, he's making straight for the lifeboat!

**[Naval base beach]**

(The Doctor crunches his way over the shingle to an upturned boat and gets out
his magnifying glass to examine the burn marks.)  
M-A-A: Oy! You!  
(The Master at Arms leads five armed ratings at the double.)  
DOCTOR: Good afternoon. I wonder whether I could see your commanding officer?

**[Quay]**

(Jo gives Robbins a ten pound note.)  
ROBBINS: Thank you, Miss.  
(Robbins gives Jo his motorcycle helmet.)  
ROBBINS: Look after it for me, won't you?  
JO: Don't worry. I'll bring it back just as soon as I've found the Doctor.  
(Jo rides off on his motorcycle.)

**[The Master's cell]**

(The Master's television set is like Trenchard's monitor, set into the wall.
He switches it on and there is the episode of the Clangers where they find a
probe has landed on their planet. The Master whistles along with the puppets.
Trenchard enters.)  
TRENCHARD: What are you watching?  
MASTER: It seems to be a rather interesting extra-terrestrial life form.  
TRENCHARD: Only puppets, you know? For children.  
MASTER: Oh.  
(The Master turns off the television.)  
TRENCHARD: Well, here's the chart you wanted.  
MASTER: Oh, good!  
(The Master spreads the chart on the table.)  
MASTER: That's right. Thank you. Now.  
(The Master plots points on the chart.)  
MASTER: You know, Trenchard, a man of your efficiency is really wasted in a
job like this.  
TRENCHARD: Huh, bit of a comedown in a way, I suppose, but  
MASTER: Never mind. Once our plan succeeds people will really begin to realise
your true worth.  
TRENCHARD: Ah. What are you doing?  
MASTER: I've just been plotting the sightings of the three sinkings. There,
there and there. And it's interesting that right in the middle of them,
there's this abandoned sea fort.  
(The marked Fort is just off Fortress Island.)  
TRENCHARD: Not abandoned any more, old chap.  
MASTER: Really?  
TRENCHARD: Hart's people are going to use it as a sonar testing station.
Contractors are working on the place now.  
MASTER: Hmm.

**[Sea Fort crew room]**

(Inside No Man's Land Sea Fort in the middle of the Solent, two men are
playing cards and drinking from cans.)  
HICKMAN: How much to see you?  
CLARK: A fiver.  
HICKMAN: Right.  
CLARK: Full house. Kings on twos.  
HICKMAN: Oh, that's marvellous, innit. Just marvellous.  
CLARK: Come on, it's not your life savings, it's only a couple of quid. I'll
give you a chance to get your own back.  
HICKMAN: Ah, forget it.  
CLARK: What's the matter with you?  
HICKMAN: I don't know. Being stuck out here, I suppose.  
CLARK: It's not so bad. Are you sure you don't want another game?  
HICKMAN: Do you know, there's something funny about this place.  
CLARK: Share the joke.  
HICKMAN: Well, the place is deserted, right?  
CLARK: So?  
HICKMAN: Just the two of us on maintenance?  
CLARK: Right.  
HICKMAN: Yet I keep getting the feeling I'm being watched.  
(Possibly by the owner of the scaly hand reaching over a hatch ledge.)

**[Outside Hart's office]**

HART: If you are from UNIT, then where are your credentials?  
DOCTOR: I never carry the things. A lot of bureaucratic nonsense. If you wish
to see my pass, then ask Miss Grant.

**[Hart's office]**

HART: Why didn't you arrange for an official visit through normal channels?  
DOCTOR: Well, I just dropped in purely on impulse, old chap. As soon as I
heard about that charred lifeboat, I had to see it.  
HART: Oh? Why?  
DOCTOR: You've inspected the boat yourself?  
HART: Well, of course I have.  
DOCTOR: Then you must have noticed the linear nature of those scorch marks.
Excuse me, my dear. May I?  
(The Doctor takes Blythe's shorthand pad and pencil.)  
DOCTOR: Now then, sit down. Now, the marks are a very definite shape, a linear
shape like this. Now, how do you account for that?  
(The Doctor draws a series of wavy lines on the pad.)  
HART: A freak affect if the ship caught fire.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but it didn't catch fire. If it had, the smoke and flames would
have been seen, wouldn't they?  
HART: All right then, how do you account for them?  
DOCTOR: A concentrated beam of heat, applied from underneath the boat whilst
it was still in the water.  
HART: Deliberately to sink a lifeboat?  
DOCTOR: Yes, to make sure there were no survivors. What are these markers
here?  
HART: Those are the last known positions of the missing vessels so far as we
can estimate.  
(Blythe answers the telephone.)  
BLYTHE: Captain Hart's office? Yes. Yes, I see. Hold on. There's a young lady
here with two UNIT passes. She wants to know if there's anyone here called the
Doctor?

**[Sea Fort crew room]**

CLARK: Come on, you can't lose anything at draughts.  
HICKMAN: There's a jinx on this place. Nothing but trouble since we started
repairing the foundations.  
CLARK: Forget it. It's not your problem. Black or white?  
(There is a noise outside.)  
HICKMAN: What's that noise?  
CLARK: It's a mermaid. She can't resist us.  
HICKMAN: Shut up! There's someone moving about upstairs.  
CLARK: It's the wind.  
HICKMAN: Fat load of use you are.  
(Hickman loads a flare gun.)  
CLARK: What are you doing there? Going to send up a distress signal?  
HICKMAN: You never know.  
(Hickman leaves. He climbs a short ladder to a walkway. Then Clark hears a
scream.)  
CLARK: Hickman! Hickman?

**[Sea Fort]**

(Clark climbs the same ladder.)  
CLARK: Hickman, where are you?  
(Clark finds Hickman lying on a concrete slab, staring at nothing. There is
something nearby.)

**[Hart's office]**

HART: Yes, well, these passes appear to be in order. You may go.  
DOCTOR: Go? My dear chap, I don't want to go. I want to visit this fort here.  
HART: That fort is being converted for use as a testing station. There's
nobody there but a couple of maintenance workmen.  
DOCTOR: Nevertheless, it is right in the centre of all the trouble, isn't it?
Now if some of your naval bods could get me out there, Captain?  
HART: Doctor, I have no authority to provide naval vessels for your pleasure
jaunts.  
DOCTOR: Look, don't you realise how important this is?  
HART: I realise only too well. Three ships have been sunk and many lives have
been lost. Now, if you don't mind?  
JO: Doctor, I think he wants us to go.  
HART: I suggest that you take your theories along to your own people at UNIT
and put the whole thing on an official level.  
DOCTOR: If Horatio Nelson had been in charge of this operation, I hardly think
that he would have waited for official instructions.  
HART: Yes, a pretty impulsive fellow, if one can believe the history books.  
DOCTOR: History books? Captain Hart, Horatio Nelson was a personal friend of
mine. Come on, Jo.  
HART: Good grief. Poor chap's as mad as a hatter.

**[Boat]**

JO: How do we get onto the fort?  
DOCTOR: Up that ladder. Now hold tight, Jo. We're coming alongside now.  
(Jo gets on to the ladder first and they climb up past the MOD property No
Landing sign.)

**[Sea Fort]**

(The Doctor and Jo walk down a metal staircase.)  
JO: I still say you should have taken Mister Robbin's boat back.  
DOCTOR: We will, Jo, we will. And we'll take his motor bicycle back at the
same time. Still, now we're here, let's take a look around, shall we?  
(A scaly green hand reaches over the side of the boat.)

**[Sea Fort crew room]**

DOCTOR: Well, somebody's here all right.  
JO: But where? Where are they, then?  
DOCTOR: This is a big fort, Jo. They must be in some other part of it. Come
on, we'll find them.

**[Sea Fort]**

(As smoke is pours out of Robbin's boat, the Doctor and Jo go exploring.)  
DOCTOR: There are supposed to be two workmen on this thing. They can't just
have vanished.  
JO: Well, they have, haven't they? Look, Doctor, it's getting dark. Let's get
out of here.  
DOCTOR: There's plenty of time.  
(KaBOOM! They look out of a nearby window at a floating life belt and Robbins'
boat for hire notice.)  
DOCTOR: It must have been the petrol tank.  
JO: But it wouldn't just blow up by itself. Doctor, do you realise we're
stranded here!  
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Jo. There must be a radio on this fort somewhere. We'll
just have to get a message back to shore. Come on.  
(A bipedal turtle-faced reptile comes out of the shadows to watch them go. The
Doctor and Jo go up that short ladder.)  
JO: Look!  
DOCTOR: What is it?  
(It is Hickman.)  
DOCTOR: He's dead, poor chap.  
JO: Oh, Doctor, let's get out of here, please.  
DOCTOR: All right. Let's find that radio first.  
JO: Shush, listen.  
(Heavy breathing, and something is approaching.)  
JO: It's coming towards us!

__**Episode Two**__

**[Sea Fort]**

(It is Clark armed with a wrench. He raises it to attack.)  
DOCTOR: Stop! We're friends! Stop!  
(The Doctor grabs Clark's arm and makes him drop the wrench.)  
CLARK: Hickman! He's dead! They killed him! Came from the sea. The sea. A sea
devil!  
DOCTOR: Come on, Jo, quick. Give me a hand.  
JO: It's all right.  
DOCTOR: We've got to get him into that cabin.  
(Jo and the Doctor half-carry Clark back the way they came.)  
CLARK: Hickman.  
DOCTOR: Come on. All right.  
CLARK: Monster.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
CLARK: Sea devil.  
DOCTOR: Now, easy.  
CLARK: Hickman.  
(The reptile watches them go.)

**[Sea Fort crew room]**

CLARK: The sea monster.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, come on, don't worry. Get yourself down here.  
(Clark lies down on the lower bunk bed.)  
DOCTOR: That's right. Mind your head. Mind yourself.  
JO: That's it.  
CLARK: Hickman.  
JO: Shush.  
DOCTOR: Where's your radio? The radio, where is it?  
(Clark points across the room.)  
DOCTOR: Over here?  
CLARK: Hickman.  
JO: Shush.  
CLARK: Ripped it out. They took it away.  
DOCTOR: Yes, they certainly did.  
(The Doctor opens the First Aid box.)  
CLARK: Devil. Sea monster. Monster.  
JO: Yes, yes, yes.  
DOCTOR: Now, listen to me Take this swab, Jo. Swab his arm. Now, are there are
more transmitters on this fort?  
CLARK: No, nothing.  
DOCTOR: Any transistor radios, that sort of thing?  
CLARK: I think so. The crew's quarters. The crew.  
JO: What do you want to do? Listen to Night Ride?  
(A popular BBC Radio 2 show.)  
DOCTOR: It is possible to turn a receiver into a transmitter, you know.  
JO: It is?  
DOCTOR: Yes, it's simply a matter of modulating the signal. You connect the
output of your loudspeaker into the input of your low frequency amplifier,
then you connect the output of your low frequency amplifier into your
oscillator. You use your loudspeaker as a microphone and there you are.  
(The Doctor fills a hypodermic with liquid.)  
JO: Ah.  
DOCTOR: Now, where exactly are these transistor radios?  
CLARK: Crew's quarters, down the corridor, next deck.  
DOCTOR: All right. Thank you. Now don't worry, this is not going to hurt you.
All right? Now you'll soon be all right.  
CLARK: Hickman.  
DOCTOR: Soon feel better. Look after him, will you, Jo?  
JO: Yes. Shush. Come on now, try and relax. Come on. That's it.

**[Sea Fort]**

(The Doctor and a reptile startle each other.)  
DOCTOR: Don't be alarmed. I've no wish to harm you.  
(The reptile raises its 'hand' which is holding a disc-like device.)  
DOCTOR: Now, wait. We must talk.  
(A bolt of red energy just misses the Doctor as he ducks. The Doctor runs up
the staircase and the reptile follows. The chase goes up and down ladders.)

**[Sea Fort crew room]**

JO: How do you feel now? Would you like a nice hot cup of tea with some sugar,
hmm?  
(The Doctor runs in and bolts the door.)  
JO: What are you doing?  
(The Doctor drags the table over to bar the door.)  
DOCTOR: Wire?  
(The Doctor find the end of a long wire and goes over to the junction box.)  
JO: What is going on?  
DOCTOR: Just as I thought. Reptiles, like those creatures in the caves. It's
completely hostile. Here, hang on to this. Tight! Hang on.  
JO: Right.  
(The other end of the wire has crocodile clips.)  
JO: Well, now what are you doing?  
(The Doctor fastens the clips to the door bolts then returns to the junction
box.)  
DOCTOR: Those creatures can cut through anything. Rock, metal, anything.  
JO: Look!  
(The metal door is starting to melt. A green hand reaches through the hole and
gropes for the bolts. The Doctor throws the power switch and it screams,
pulling its hand back. He turns the power off again.)  
DOCTOR: Come on. Give me a hand.  
(The Doctor pulls the table back and unbolts the door.)  
JO: Where are we going?  
DOCTOR: We've got to get after that creature. Now, come on.  
(They chase it through the fort until it jumps out of a broken window into the
sea.)

**[Hart's office]**

(WRNS Blythe is on the phone.)  
BLYTHE: Keep trying.  
(Hart enters.)  
HART: Morning, Blythe.  
BLYTHE: Good morning, sir.  
HART: Anything in?  
BLYTHE: We've had this report from the civilian police, sir. That man who was
here yesterday trying to get over to the fort, seems to have disappeared with
the boat he came in.  
HART: Oh, no.  
BLYTHE: He and the girl were seen heading out to sea yesterday afternoon.
There's been no sign of them since.  
HART: Well, get onto the fort and see if they've wound up there.  
BLYTHE: I've already done that, sir. The fort just wasn't answering. I can't
raise them at all.  
HART: Well, we'd better take a look around. Get me Air Sea Rescue.  
(A Sea King takes off.)

**[Sea Fort crew room]**

JO: How's it going?  
DOCTOR: Nearly finished. Just about to test it.  
(The Doctor has been working on a transistor radio.)  
JO: Hmm, I've seen things like that in a modern art exhibition. You don't
honestly think you can transmit with it, do you?  
DOCTOR: Certainly I do. I'll prove it to you. Right, here goes.  
D J [OC]: Hey there, early birds, we've got a wonderful batch of discs for you
this morning! So, don't feel isolated and cut off from the world. Whoever you
are, wherever you are, we've got something just for you!  
JO: Hey, that was my favourite DJ.  
DOCTOR: I think I must have got me wires crossed somewhere.  
JO: Here's your tea.  
DOCTOR: Thanks.  
JO: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Mmm?  
JO: Those things that attacked us. You said you'd seen something like it
before.  
DOCTOR: Something very similar, certainly. They emerged from some caves in
Derbyshire.  
JO:  The Silurians, wasn't it? The Brigadier was telling me.  
DOCTOR: That's a complete misnomer. The chap who discovered them must have got
the period wrong. No, properly speaking, they should have been called the
Eocenes.  
JO: That was that race of super reptiles that had been in hibernation for
billions of years, wasn't it?  
DOCTOR: That's right, and if you want my opinion, there's another of their
colony right here beneath us.  
JO: Well, something seems to have woken them up.  
DOCTOR: Probably the rebuilding of this fort.  
JO: But I thought you said they lived in caves?  
DOCTOR: Well, this is a different species, completely adapted to life
underwater.  
JO: And they've been sinking this ships?  
DOCTOR: Very likely.  
JO: Why? I mean, why are they so hostile? What have we done to them?  
DOCTOR: They still think of Earth as their planet, Jo, and they want it back.
As far as they're concerned, man is just an ape who got above himself. Right,
I think that should do it. Let's have another go. Hello, hello. Mayday,
Mayday, Mayday! This is, er, this, er, this is. What is this? What's our call
sign?  
(Jo reads the note on the wall above where the radio used to be.)  
JO: Oscar Bravo Tango Seven Four.  
DOCTOR: Hello, Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, this is Oscar Bravo Tango Seven Four.
We are stranded on this fort and have a wounded man here. Can you send
immediate assistance? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Over.  
JO: Oh Doctor, you don't think you'll get through to anybody on that old lash-
up, do you?  
PILOT [OC]: Hello, Oscar Bravo Tango, am receiving you loud and clear. Am
about to land. Over.  
(Helicopter rotors can be heard overhead.)  
JO: It works!  
DOCTOR: Hello, Oscar Bravo Tango speaking. Who are you? Who are you? Over.  
(Jo runs outside to look through a window.)  
JO: It's a helicopter!  
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, though I say so myself, I think that's a remarkably
efficient piece of work.  
(And the set goes Bang!)

**[The Master's cell]**

(Trenchard enters with a guard who is carrying a large box.)  
TRENCHARD: Right, put it over there. Here we are then.  
MASTER: Splendid!  
TRENCHARD: None too easy, you know, getting hold of something like this at a
moments notice. Had to send one of my chaps to the mainland. Said it was for
theatricals.  
MASTER: How very ingenious.  
TRENCHARD: Nothing to it. Just have to use the old loaf, you know. When do we
leave?  
(The Master is wearing a naval officer's cap.)  
MASTER: As soon as possible.

**[Hart's office]**

(Hart enters with the Doctor and Jo.)  
HART: How can I go to the Admiralty with a story like that? Sea Devils. If
only you had some proof.  
JO: What about the two men on the fort? One of them was killed but the other
one saw the creature.  
HART: Yes. Get on to sickbay, will you? See if he's conscious yet.  
BLYTHE: Sickbay, please. Oh hello, Captain Hart's secretary  
DOCTOR: Even you must admit that something happened on that fort!  
HART: Well, perhaps one of them went berserk and attacked the other one.  
JO: But we saw it too, remember?  
HART: You may. Well, Blythe?  
BLYTHE: He's still delirious and he's babbling something about sea devils.

**[Naval base]**

(A prison guard drives Trenchard into HMS Seaspite and parks up. Actually HMS
St George, Portsmouth)  
TRENCHARD: You can go to the Petty Officer's mess. I'll send for you later.  
GUARD: Very good, sir.  
(The guard leaves. Trenchard looks around then knocks on the side of the car
and walks away. The Master comes out from underneath a rug in the back dressed
in a Lieutenant Commander's uniform. A squad of ratings marches past.)  
CPO: Squad, eyes right!  
(The Master salutes.)  
CPO: Eyes front! About turn! Squad, halt!  
(The Master walks off into the base, saluting another group of sailors on his
way.)

**[Hart's office]**

HART: (into phone) Well, did he say why he wanted to see me? Oh, all right,
you'd better send him up. All right then, Doctor, let's assume that I accept
the existence of these Sea Devils. What do you want me to do?  
DOCTOR: Well, to begin with, we must make every effort to make contact with
them.  
HART: But you claim that they're responsible for sinking the ships.  
DOCTOR: It may still be possible to find a peaceful solution. We're not
dealing with animals, Captain Hart, we're dealing with intelligent beings.  
(There is a knock on the door and Trenchard enters.)  
TRENCHARD: Have you got a minute, old chap? Ah, thanks very much. Want a word
with you about the golf tournament. Good heavens!  
DOCTOR: Colonel Trenchard.  
TRENCHARD: Doctor. Miss Grant. Thought you two'd left the island yesterday.  
JO: Well, we didn't quite manage to get away.  
TRENCHARD: Taking a look round the island? Charming spot, isn't it?  
(Hart clears his throat loudly.)  
TRENCHARD: Er, sorry to bother you, John, old man, but it's about the weekend.
We are rather relying on you, you know.  
HART: Of course I'll do my best, but if we get a bit of a flap on, then  
TRENCHARD: That's just what I was thinking, so perhaps it would be as well if
I arranged to have a reserve standing by.  
DOCTOR: Yes, why don't you do that, Colonel? Captain Hart is likely to be very
busy from now on.  
HART: Yes, life is rather full at the moment, George.  
TRENCHARD: Exactly! So as I was passing, I just thought, old John's going to
pretty tied up with all these ship's sinking. Is it fair to ask him to play
golf in the middle of something like this? So I said to myself, What I'll do
is I'll just drop by and sound him out. You see, time's getting short and I've
got to get cracking.

**[Naval base stores]**

(The Master goes behind the counter and starts collecting items from the
shelves. He is putting them into a duffel bag when the Chief enters.)  
SMEDLEY: I'm sorry, sir, but should I know you?  
MASTER: You certainly should, Chief. Had you not been warned of my coming?  
SMEDLEY: No, I'm afraid not, sir.  
MASTER: Special audit, Ministry of Defence.  
SMEDLEY: Special audit, sir?  
MASTER: Yes, the items in this bag here are defective. Did you realise that
you were carrying defective supplies here, Chief?  
SMEDLEY: Look, I'm sorry, sir, but do you mind if I see your pass, please?  
MASTER: Captain Hart's preparing it right now. He'll be bringing it down right
away.  
SMEDLEY: I see, sir. Well then, you won't mind if I just phone and double
check then, will you.  
MASTER: What exactly are you suggesting?  
SMEDLEY: I'm not suggesting anything, sir. I'm just obeying orders.  
MASTER: You will obey my order, Chief Petty Officer!  
SMEDLEY: Your order, sir?  
(The Master fixes Smedley with his Look.)  
MASTER: You will obey me. You have seen my pass and it is quite correct.  
SMEDLEY: Your pass.  
MASTER: You have seen my pass.  
SMEDLEY: No, I've got to phone and check.  
(So the Master gives him a chop to the back of the neck, picks up the bag and
leaves.)

**[Hart's office]**

HART: Now, don't worry, George. If I can't make the tournament, I'll let you
know in plenty of time.  
TRENCHARD: Yes, but you do understand I don't want you to feel under any
pressure about this. If you want to drop out, I suppose I could rope in old
Harry.  
HART: Well, perhaps that's for the best. Now, if you don't mind, George?  
TRENCHARD: At the same time, I don't want you to miss your game. I mean ,we
we'd much rather have you if you can manage it.  
HART: Well, I'll do my best. Now goodbye, George.  
TRENCHARD: Yes, yes, of course. I see how busy you are.  
HART: Yes.  
TRENCHARD: Staying down here much longer, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: It entirely depends how long it takes me to conclude my business. Good
day, Colonel.  
TRENCHARD: Yes, yes, of course, I mustn't hold you up. Goodbye, Miss Grant.
It's been a great pleasure to see you again.  
JO: Goodbye, Colonel.  
TRENCHARD: Well, I'll, er, I'll be pushing off then. Oh, thanks very much.  
HART: I'll be in touch, George.  
TRENCHARD: Yes.  
(Trenchard leaves.)  
HART: Now then, Doctor, where were we?  
DOCTOR: Where were we indeed? Ships must be kept away from this area.  
HART: Doctor, those are major shipping lanes. We'd have protests from all over
the world.  
DOCTOR: You'll have even bigger protests if ships go on sinking.  
HART: And even if we do declare it a prohibited area, how are we going to
enforce it?  
(Jo looks out of the window and sees something that surprises her.)  
HART: You know what happens in the English Channel. Trinity House marker buoys
are ignored half the time.  
DOCTOR: You'll just have to patrol the area, won't you?  
HART: What are we supposed to do? (unintelligible under music)  
DOCTOR: You don't seem to realise how dangerous  
JO: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: What?  
JO: Doctor, come here!  
DOCTOR: Jo, please, not now.  
HART: Don't you believe it.  
JO: Doctor, it's the Master!  
DOCTOR: What? Where?  
JO: Down  
(The area is empty.)  
JO: But it was him. Look, I know it was.  
DOCTOR: Captain Hart, I suggest that you order a full security alert
immediately.  
HART: Would you mind telling me what this is all about?  
DOCTOR: Miss Grant has just seen a very dangerous criminal on your base.  
HART: Doctor, I've been very patient with you, but if I thought  
BLYTHE: Sir, someone's been found unconscious in the sonar stores.  
DOCTOR: Come on.  
(The guard drives Trenchard and the lumpy car rug out of the gates just before
the alarm sounds.)

**[Naval base stores]**

SMEDLEY: I don't know. He was taking equipment, sir. Said he was doing some
special audit. Well, I went to phone up to check and that's when he hit me.  
DOCTOR: What did this officer look like?  
SMEDLEY: About my height. He was dark and he had a short beard.  
JO: You see? The Master.  
HART: Who is the Master?  
JO: How did he get in here? He's supposed to be locked up.  
DOCTOR: Trenchard.  
JO: What?  
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? He arrived just before this happened and he left
a few moments ago.  
JO: Of course. All that silly talk about a golf tournament.  
HART: Are you suggesting that George Trenchard is mixed up in all this?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I certainly am. Captain Hart, can you lend me some transport?  
HART: Well, of course I can, but what's it all about?  
DOCTOR: No time to explain now. Come on, Jo.

**[Governor's office]**

(The Doctor and Jo arrive at the castle in a Royal Navy Land Rover. Trenchard
is practising his putting, and boy does he need the practise. There is a knock
at the door.)  
TRENCHARD: In conference.  
(The Doctor enters, followed by Jo.)  
DOCTOR: Colonel Trenchard.  
TRENCHARD: Hello, old chap. What are you doing here?  
DOCTOR: I've reason to believe that your prisoner has escaped.  
TRENCHARD: Nonsense!  
DOCTOR: It is?  
TRENCHARD: See for yourself.  
(Trenchard turns on the monitor. The Master is reading a book.)  
TRENCHARD: There you are, you see? Safe and sound.  
JO: Well he may be here now, but half an hour ago he was at the naval base.  
TRENCHARD: Impossible. Must be a case of mistaken identity.  
(The Doctor gives him a Look of his own.)  
TRENCHARD: I'll tell you what, though. I'll go and check the guards myself.  
DOCTOR: Yes, you do that.  
TRENCHARD: Yes.  
(Trenchard leaves. A moment later Jo checks that the corridor is empty.)  
JO: All clear.  
DOCTOR: Try and get an outside line. No, they're both completely dead. Now
listen, Jo. I want you to take the jeep, go down to the naval base and call
UNIT. Tell them that Colonel Trenchard and his entire staff are to replaced
immediately.  
JO: But, Doctor  
DOCTOR: No buts, Jo. Just do as I ask.  
JO: What about you?  
DOCTOR: Now, don't worry about me. I'll stay here and keep an eye on him. Now,
you hurry.

**[The Master's cell]**

TRENCHARD: But the girl saw you!  
MASTER: Oh, it could only have been a fleeting glimpse. Convince her that she
was mistaken.  
TRENCHARD: I tell you, they don't believe me. The Doctor knows.  
MASTER: Very well. In that case, suggest to the Doctor that he come down here
and see me for himself.  
TRENCHARD: What's the good of that?  
MASTER: I'll tell him exactly what we're doing. I'll convince him to keep
quiet.  
TRENCHARD: Could you?  
MASTER: Yes, yes. But I must see him alone. I don't want any guards. You leave
everything to me. I'll put the Doctor's mind at rest.  
TRENCHARD: All right. I suppose it's worth a try.  
(Trenchard leaves. The Master climbs on a chair and removes a grille from in
front of a security camera. He puts a cloth over the lens and replaces the
grille. Then he presses a button by the inner door and sits down. A guard
enters.)  
MASTER: Ah, I think there's something wrong with the air conditioning in here.
Now, that grille seems to be blocked.  
(The guard turns and looks up, and the Master hits him on the back of the
head, double fisted, and takes his knife.)

**[Governor's office]**

(The Doctor blindfolds himself and lines up the golf ball. Trenchard enters.)  
TRENCHARD: I've seen the guards. Everything's in perfect order.  
DOCTOR: Fore!  
(The golf ball shoots along the carpet and into the glass.)  
TRENCHARD: Bless my soul!  
DOCTOR: You were saying, Colonel?  
TRENCHARD: Er, where's Miss Grant?  
DOCTOR: Oh, she's gone back to the naval base.  
TRENCHARD: Oh, I see. Look here, old chap, if you're worried, I suggest you go
and see the prisoner yourself.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I've just seen him.  
TRENCHARD: What?  
DOCTOR: Yes, on there.  
TRENCHARD: Oh! Yes, quite, but if you're in any doubt, I'd sooner you
interrogated the man yourself. You know the way, don't you?  
DOCTOR: If you insist.  
(The Doctor leaves. Trenchard picks up the internal phone.)  
TRENCHARD: Trenchard here. There is a Miss Grant on her way down to you. She
is not to leave.

**[The Master's cell]**

(The door is wide open and there are no guards. The Doctor stands in the
doorway.)  
MASTER: Why, Doctor, so you came for a chat.  
DOCTOR: Been out for a little jaunt, have you?  
MASTER: I beg your pardon?  
DOCTOR: Why did you go to the naval stores and steal those electronic spares?  
MASTER: How could I possibly go anywhere? You know very well that I'm a
prisoner.  
DOCTOR: You've got some sort of hold over Colonel Trenchard. What's going on?  
MASTER: I can see that I shall have to tell you everything.  
(The Master produces the guard's gun from under his newspaper.)  
DOCTOR: Good afternoon!  
(And shuts the door.)

**[Outside the Master's cell]**

(The Master opens the door and steps out.)  
DOCTOR: Akidai!  
(And kicks the gun out of the Master's hand. The Master grabs a foil from a
rack on the wall.)  
DOCTOR: Like that is it?  
(And takes a foil from another rack. The two foes fence. The Doctor pushes the
Master back, and he stumbles, so the Doctor disappears behind a curtained
doorway. The Master starts slashing at the fabric.)  
DOCTOR: I wouldn't do that if I were you. That's government property.  
(The Doctor has come round behind him. They cross swords again and the Master
pushes the Doctor into the cell.)

**[The Master's cell]**

(Where the Doctor falls back across the table, dodges the Master's attacks
then disarms him, holding him pinned by the tip of his foil.)  
DOCTOR: I always find that violent exercise makes me hungry. Don't you agree?  
(The Doctor takes a bite from one of the Master's sandwiches.)  
MASTER: Then you'd better enjoy your meal, Doctor, because it might be your
last.  
DOCTOR: Oh, you think so?  
(The Doctor returns the Master's foil. The Master drives him back into the
chair.)  
MASTER: You're good, Doctor, but you're not good enough.  
DOCTOR: Ah, but you haven't seen the quality of my footwork yet!  
(The Doctor kicks the Master back over the table. Disarmed again, the Master
stays on the floor.)  
DOCTOR: Tut, tut, tut. How many times have I told you? Violence will never get
you anywhere.  
(The Doctor turns his back, the Master gets up and throws the knife.)

__**Episode Three**__

**[The Master's cell]**

TRENCHARD: What's going on here?  
(The Doctor looks round as the knife thuds into the bathroom door frame.)  
MASTER: I was defending myself. This man came here to kill me.  
TRENCHARD: Be so good as to explain yourself, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Only a complete fool would listen to such an accusation. Though I
suppose in your case.  
TRENCHARD: Don't speak to me like that. I shall have a full enquiry into the
whole thing. Meanwhile, consider yourself under arrest. Take him to my office
immediately.  
DOCTOR: Oh, don't be absurd, man.  
TRENCHARD: You heard me. Take him away. (A guard keeps the Doctor covered with
his pistol as he throws down the foils and walks across the cell.)  
DOCTOR: If you must continue with this ridiculous charade. Only take care not
to lose him this time, won't you?  
(The Doctor and the guard leave.)  
TRENCHARD: What are you going to do, kill him? I warn you  
MASTER: I told you. I was defending myself. The point is, what are you going
to do about it?  
TRENCHARD: This whole thing's getting out of hand. I just don't know.  
MASTER: Well then, I'll tell you. Keep the Doctor here a prisoner. You have no
alternative. By the way, is the girl with him?  
TRENCHARD: Yes. She was going to leave, but I had her stopped at the main
entrance.  
MASTER: Good. Then there's nothing to worry about.

**[Castle entrance]**

(Jo goes up to the guard who is holding the car keys. He puts them in his
pocket.)  
JO: The keys! I've got to get back to the naval base. It's urgent!  
BARCLAY: Sorry, Miss. Orders. Take her back inside.  
(Barclay turns Jo around so she elbows him in the stomach and pushes him into
his colleague, then runs.)  
BARCLAY: Well, don't just sit there. Get after her!

**[Governor's office]**

(The guard is standing in front of the monitor, staring directly ahead.)  
DOCTOR: Have you any idea why Colonel Trenchard is taking orders from the
Master? Look, man, I'm talking to you.  
(The Doctor snaps his fingers in front of the guard's face and gets him to
turn his head slightly.)  
DOCTOR: Very well.  
(Trenchard enters.)  
TRENCHARD: Now then, Doctor, I'm afraid you're in very serious trouble. I've
been giving this matter some thought. I'm going to hold you here until the
whole thing's cleared up.  
DOCTOR: Is that what the Master told you to say?  
TRENCHARD: You've attacked a government employee, and tried to harm a prisoner
under my care and protection.  
DOCTOR: I've done no such thing. The Master knocked that guard out himself, as
you very well know.  
TRENCHARD: And as for this UNIT pass of yours, I believe it's a forgery.  
(Trenchard rips up the UNIT 10 pass.)  
DOCTOR: That's absolute rubbish. Anybody at UNIT headquarters will vouch for
me, if you'll permit me to use the telephone.  
TRENCHARD: Prisoners are not allowed to make telephone calls.  
DOCTOR: Colonel Trenchard, why are you allowing the Master to use you like
this?  
TRENCHARD: All right, take him away.  
DOCTOR: Look, you're jeopardising your entire career.  
TRENCHARD: I have nothing further to say to you. The interview is over.  
DOCTOR: Didn't anybody else warn you about the Master? Whatever he's told you,
it's all lies.  
TRENCHARD: You'll be well treated as long as you behave yourself.  
DOCTOR: You really think you can keep me here?  
TRENCHARD: This is no ordinary prison. If you attempt to escape, the guards
will shoot to kill.  
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you. Thank you very much.  
(The Doctor and the guard leave. The telephone rings.)  
TRENCHARD: Trenchard. What? Then find her. Now!  
(Jo hides behind some brambles as a bunch of guards run past, then sets off
again.)

**[The Master's cell]**

(The Master is doing some delicate soldering, looking through a magnifying
glass on a stand.)  
TRENCHARD: I've got him under lock and key.  
MASTER: Just a minute. Under lock and key, eh?  
TRENCHARD: Yes.  
MASTER: The girl, too?  
TRENCHARD: What a fascinating contraption.  
MASTER: I asked about the girl.  
TRENCHARD: Oh, little mishap on the way back here. She got away.  
MASTER: And by now is, no doubt, running straight back to the naval base.  
TRENCHARD: Oh, no fear of that. She'll never get out of the grounds. Guards'll
pick her up at any moment.  
MASTER: I hope that you're right.  
TRENCHARD: Oh, no doubt about it.  
MASTER: Nevertheless, we need to work very fast from now on. Trenchard, I need
your fullest cooperation. Tell me, where is the Doctor?  
TRENCHARD: In a security cell.  
MASTER: Send him to me, will you? I want a word with him.

**[Hart's office]**

HART: I can't give you much to go on, I'm afraid, but I believe there's
something down there. Your submarine's fitted with the new experimental sonar.
It'll give you a chance to try it out.  
(The submarine Commander sports a 'full set' of whiskers.)  
RIDGEWAY: What are we looking for, sir?  
HART: I wish I knew. The man we took off the fort was babbling something about
sea devils.  
RIDGEWAY: Oh, don't you think this is getting a bit out of hand, sir? Ships
have vanished at sea before.  
HART: I'm well aware of that. To be exact, seventy in the last ten years. But
we've lost three all in the same area in the last few weeks.  
RIDGEWAY: We'll do what we can to find your sea devils, sir.  
HART: I want you to signal me a full report the moment you resurface.  
RIDGEWAY: Yes, sir.  
HART: All right, carry on.  
RIDGEWAY: Thank you, sir.  
HART: And good luck.  
RIDGEWAY: Thank you, sir.  
(Ridgeway leaves.)  
BLYTHE: Excuse me, sir?  
HART: Yes?  
BLYTHE: I was just wondering about Miss Grant and the Doctor. Shouldn't they
be back by now?

**[The Master's cell]**

TRENCHARD: All right, Doctor. Come along in.  
(The Doctor has his wrists loosely manacled. A guard stands in the doorway.
The Master is back in his usual suit.)  
MASTER: Ah, Doctor. Good of you to spare me a few moments.  
DOCTOR: I hadn't really anything better to do.  
MASTER: Yes, time does hang heavy when one is a prisoner. Would you care to
sit down?  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
(The Master silently indicates the manacles.)  
TRENCHARD: Right.  
(The guard unfastens one cuff.)  
DOCTOR: How very kind of you.  
(Then pulls the Doctor's arms behind the chair and fastens it again.)  
DOCTOR: How very unkind of you.  
TRENCHARD: Right, I'll leave you to have your little chat. There will be a
guard outside at all times.  
DOCTOR: I'm very relieved to hear it.  
(Trenchard and the guard leave. The Master shuts the door.)  
MASTER: No doubt, Doctor, you're wondering why I sent for you?  
DOCTOR: Your usual childish desire to gloat, perhaps?  
MASTER: How much have you told UNIT?  
DOCTOR: Everything. I sent them a full report as soon as Miss Grant spotted
you at the naval base.  
MASTER: And yet you came back here to investigate in person. Interesting. You
know, I wonder whether you're telling me the truth.  
DOCTOR: Well, you'll find out soon enough.  
MASTER: You realise, of course, that I could kill you here and now?  
DOCTOR: And how would you explain that away to Colonel Trenchard? I'm hardly
in a position to attack you, now am I?  
MASTER: Do you really think I care what Trenchard thinks?  
DOCTOR: Whatever you're up to, you still need Trenchard's cooperation. You're
still a prisoner here, you know.  
MASTER: My dear Doctor, I can walk out of here any time I choose.  
DOCTOR: Then why don't you?  
MASTER: Because this place makes a good base for my operations. You see, I'm
planning to contact our reptilian friends.  
DOCTOR: How do you know about them?  
MASTER: Oh, from the Time Lord's files.  
DOCTOR: More stolen information?  
MASTER: Naturally.  
DOCTOR: Well, why do you want to contact them?  
MASTER: Those reptiles, Doctor, were once the rulers of this Earth. And with
my help, they can be so again.

**[Naval base radio room]**

RIDGEWAY [OC]: Entering the specified zone now, sir. About to dive.  
HART: Very well. Standing by for your report. Carry on.  
BOWMAN: Sir.

**[Hart's office]**

BLYTHE: Excuse me, sir.  
HART: Yes, what is it?  
BLYTHE: I hope you don't mind, but I telephoned Colonel Trenchard about the
UNIT people. He said they'd both gone back to London.  
HART: Oh, I see.  
BLYTHE: But they didn't bring the Land Rover back, sir. Colonel Trenchard said
they took a taxi to the quay.  
HART: Well, you'd better send someone to collect it.  
BLYTHE: Yes, sir, but why take a taxi when they could have used the Land
Rover, and, well  
HART: Well, go on.  
BLYTHE: Well, sir, surely they'd have come back here before leaving the
island?

**[Submarine]**

(The submarine is now fully submerged.)  
RIDGEWAY: Keep fifty feet.  
MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir. (into com) Stand by to blow Q.  
RATING [OC]: Stand by to blow Q.  
MITCHELL: Blow Q.  
RATING [OC]: Blow Q.  
RIDGEWAY: Up periscope. Right, Number One, stand by to start your sonar watch.  
MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir. Er, what are we looking for, sir?  
RIDGEWAY: I don't know. Maybe we'll know when we find it.  
MITCHELL: Sir.

**[The Master's cell]**

DOCTOR: I still don't see why you want to help them. What can you possibly
gain?  
MASTER: The pleasure of seeing the human race exterminated, Doctor. The human
race of which you are so fond. Believe me, that'll be a reward in itself.  
(A guard enters.)  
DREW: The governor wants to see you, sir.  
MASTER: In a moment.  
DREW: He wants to see you now, sir.  
DOCTOR: Better run along, old chap. You're still a prisoner here, you know.  
(The Master picks up his device.)  
DOCTOR: You'll never get it off the ground.  
(The Master leaves and the Doctor starts to test how the chain of his manacles
has been twisted around the frame of the chair. Outside, Jo hides by the
sandbags of a firing range as a group of guards drive past in a 2CV. She tries
an old wooden door in the castle wall, but it stays shut so she moves on.)

**[Governor's office]**

TRENCHARD: Captain Hart's car has been spotted heading for the main gate. He
must have guessed something's up. What am I to do?  
MASTER: Use your intelligence, Trenchard. Bluff him.

**[The Master's cell]**

(Jo runs around the castle, looking in windows until she spots the Doctor. She
taps on the glass behind the iron bars and gestures to him, indicating that
she has to carry on finding a way in, and he is to wait five minutes then
start making a lot of noise. The Doctor mouths 'okay' and looks at the clock.
2:07. Jo carries on round the building until she finds a sash window which has
been left slightly open. It is just big enough for her to crawl through into a
small room then out across a small, cluttered courtyard and through a doorway
under an external stone staircase that a guard comes down. From there she
makes her way through small corridors. It is now 2:13.)  
DOCTOR: Anyone out there?

**[Outside the Master's cell]**

DOCTOR [OC]: I said, is there anyone out there?  
DREW: Please be quiet, sir.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Look, guard, I want to talk to you. I said I want to talk to you!  
(Jo peeks round the corner.)

**[The Master's cell]**

DREW: What's all the noise about, sir?  
DOCTOR: How much longer am I going to be kept chained up like this?

**[Outside the Master's cell]**

(Jo creeps down some stairs towards the open door.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: What about the Geneva convention?  
DREW [OC]: You'll have to stay here till someone tells me different, sir.  
DOCTOR [OC]: What about some food, then? I'm sure they didn't tell you to
starve me to death.  
DREW [OC]: You'll be fed when the time comes.

**[The Master's cell]**

(Jo enters unseen and hides behind the door.)  
DOCTOR: You tell Colonel Trenchard that I want to see him straight away. He's
got no right to keep me here like this.  
DREW: Look, sir, you're a lot better off here than in one of the cells, so
please be quiet, sir.  
(Drew leaves and Jo waves at the Doctor then checks his manacles.)  
DOCTOR: (silent) You'll find tools over there.  
(Jo gets the small screwdrivers from the Master's table and starts picking the
lock.)

**[Governor's office]**

TRENCHARD: There's nothing more I can tell you, old chap. I'm as puzzled as
you are. Just called for a taxi and off they went.  
HART: I see. But Miss Grant was sure she'd caught sight of your prisoner at
the base.  
TRENCHARD: Absolutely ridiculous! This place is totally secure. Oh, just take
a look at the alarm system. There.  
(Trenchard calls up a diagram on the monitor.)  
HART: And you see, George, you did drop in on me at exactly the time of the
robbery.  
TRENCHARD: My dear chap, you're scarcely suggesting that I pinched your
wretched material? Don't understand the stuff. Tried to make myself a crystal
set once when I was a lad. Never got it to work.  
HART: Well then, would it be possible to see your prisoner?  
TRENCHARD: Oh, strictly against the rules. No one can see him without a
special pass. Completely incommunicado.  
HART: Oh, surely we can stretch the rules, George? This is important.  
TRENCHARD: Well, all right, old chap, seeing it's you. Take a look at him on
this.  
HART: Thank you.  
(Trenchard tunes the monitor to a view of the Master reading a book.)  
TRENCHARD: There you are.  
HART: Well, I suppose the Doctor must have been wrong.  
TRENCHARD: Of course he was. Seemed a pretty cranky sort of fellow to me.  
(Trenchard turns the monitor off.)  
HART: Er  
TRENCHARD: Time for a quick one?  
HART: No. I should be going, George.  
TRENCHARD: Yes, yes, of course. I realise how busy you are.  
HART: Well, thank you. Look here, George, I  
TRENCHARD: The guard will see you out.  
HART: Yes, thank you.  
TRENCHARD: Bye, John.

**[Submarine]**

(The sonar is operating.)  
RIDGEWAY: Anything, Number One?  
MITCHELL: Er, no, sir. Nothing. Nothing at all.  
RIDGEWAY: Well, keep trying, old chap.  
MITCHELL: Sir.  
(There is a return ping.)  
MITCHELL: Er, we have a contact, sir.  
(The sonar goes to simultaneous pings and the operator, Lovell, rips off his
headphones.)  
RIDGEWAY: What the blazes is that?  
LOVELL: It's gone crazy, sir.  
RIDGEWAY: Get on to the sonar maintenance.  
MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir.  
LOVELL: It's packed up, sir.  
MITCHELL: It's gone dead, sir!  
(Then the lights go out.)  
RIDGEWAY: What the devil's going on?  
ENGINEER [OC]: Manoeuvring room here, sir. Loss of essential power supplies.  
MAN [OC]: Reporting loss of essential power supplies.  
MAN 2 [OC]: Loss of essential supplies.  
MAN 3 [OC]: I repeat, no essential power supplies.  
(The submarine hangs dead in the water.)

**[Governor's office]**

(The Master comes down a small staircase in the office.)  
MASTER: Well, Trenchard. I think that you handled Captain Hart exceedingly
well.  
TRENCHARD: I can't keep it up, you know. The lies I've told. How long before
that device of yours is ready?  
MASTER: Oh, just a few hours now.  
TRENCHARD: What is exactly is it?  
MASTER: It's a perfect replica of the communications device used by the enemy
agents. We are going to use it to lure them into a trap.  
TRENCHARD: I only hope it works. If it doesn't, I'm for it, you know?  
MASTER: Oh, it'll work. Don't you worry about that. Just think of it,
Trenchard. You will be responsible for exposing some of the most dangerous
saboteurs this country has ever known. I think you'll find that a grateful
government will give you anything that you ask for.  
TRENCHARD: Oh, don't want any reward, of course. Just doing my duty.  
MASTER: Yes, of course. I'd better get back to my quarters.  
TRENCHARD: This Doctor fellow, have you finished with him?  
MASTER: For the time being, yes. Oh, by the way, what about the girl? Have
they caught her yet?  
TRENCHARD: Oh, grounds are very large, you know. Only a matter of time,
though. She can't get away.  
MASTER: I hope you're right. Er, it might be better if one of the guards were
to take me back.  
TRENCHARD: Huh? Oh, yes, of course! Er, must keep up appearances, what? Guard?

**[The Master's cell]**

(Jo finishes picking the lock on the manacles. It is 2:20.)  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Behind the door.  
(Jo hides again.)  
DOCTOR: Guard! Guard. Guard! I want to talk to you!  
(Drew enters.)  
DREW: What's wrong now, sir?  
DOCTOR: These handcuffs. They're far too tight. They're killing me.  
(Jo kneels down directly behind Drew.)  
DREW: I'm under strict instructions, sir, that they're to be kept on  
(The Doctor butts Drew, sending him tumbling over Jo, who then chops him
across the throat. The Doctor unwinds the chains from the chair.)  
DOCTOR: After you.  
JO: No, after you.  
DOCTOR: No, no. After you.

**[Hart's office]**

HART: Anything from the sub?  
BLYTHE: No sir.  
HART: Look here, Blythe, you'd better get on to UNIT and see if they've any
news yet of the Doctor and Miss Grant's return.  
BLYTHE: Right, sir.

**[The Master's cell]**

(Trenchard looks in to see the Master holding the manacles and cradling Drew's
head in his lap.)  
TRENCHARD: What's happened?  
MASTER: It would appear that Miss Grant has succeeded in releasing the Doctor.  
TRENCHARD: This is appalling! It'll ruin everything!  
MASTER: Exactly. That's why you've got to find them!

**[Submarine]**

(The boat is sinking.)  
MITCHELL: It's no good, sir. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the
engines. We've run a complete check on them.  
RIDGEWAY: And we're still going down.  
(She hits bottom.)  
MITCHELL: What do we do now, sir?  
RIDGEWAY: Keep working on the engines.  
MITCHELL: There's nothing wrong with them, sir. There's nothing wrong with any
part of this boat. We've checked everything.  
RIDGEWAY: Then check again.  
(Something starts banging on the hull.)  
MITCHELL: Divers?  
RIDGEWAY: That's impossible.  
MITCHELL: There's something out there, sir.  
RATING [OC]: Forward section here, sir. We're being attacked.  
(Men shouting in the background.)  
RIDGEWAY: This is the captain. what's happening?  
RATING [OC]: Someone's coming in, sir, through the escape compartment.  
RIDGEWAY: Shut off forward and aft escape compartments.  
MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir.  
RIDGEWAY: What's happening, man?  
RATING [OC]: They're coming in, sir! They're Aargh!

**[Governor's office]**

TRENCHARD: (into phone) Understand this. They've got to be found. They're two
dangerous enemy agents. Use every available man.

**[Castle grounds]**

(The Doctor and Jo run down a slope. Nearby is a bayonet practice area. A
guard watches them go.)  
BARCLAY: Ground to control. Subjects entering sector twenty seven.

**[Governor's office]**

TRENCHARD: Yes, yes, all right.  
(Trenchard puts the phone down.)  
TRENCHARD: They're making for the beach, towards the minefield.  
MASTER: No doubt they're trying to rejoin their associates at sea.  
TRENCHARD: Right. We must head them off.  
MASTER: No. Let them get to the beach.  
TRENCHARD: But we've got to catch them.  
MASTER: We shall. This device is now ready for testing. We shall use it trap
them all together.  
(The Master switches on his device. A small dish starts spinning, broadcasting
its signal.)

**[Cliff and Beach]**

(The Doctor uses the rope from a life-belt at the top of the sandy cliff to
rappel down to the beach.)  
DOCTOR: Come on, Jo! Come on!  
(The Master, Trenchard and guards are running towards them so she goes down
the rope too. The Master kneels on the cliff edge with his transmitter. The
Doctor and Jo run across the beach but are cut off by guards in a 2CV. To
their right is a cordoned off area labelled Danger Minefield. The Master
switches on his transmitter and points it at the waves. A reptile like the one
on the old Fort emerges from the surf. The guards turn.)  
JO: Doctor, look!

__**Episode Four**__

**[Cliff and Beach]**

TRENCHARD: What is it?  
MASTER: One of the creatures that have been destroying the ships.  
TRENCHARD: You told me it was enemy agents. Why didn't you tell me the truth?  
MASTER: If I had, would you have believed me?  
(On the beach, the guards are staring at the reptile.)  
DOCTOR: There's only one thing for it. We'll have to go through the minefield.  
(The reptile uses its weapon and kills one guard, then another. A gunfight
starts. The Doctor throws himself across the first roll of barbed wire to
flatten it and let Jo across, then the second and into the minefield proper.)  
JO: We'll get blown up.  
DOCTOR: No, don't worry.  
JO: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: My sonic screwdriver. It converts into rather a good mine detector.  
(The screwdriver pings like sonar. This attracts the reptile who has now
killed all the guards.)  
DOCTOR: Look out. Look, there's one over there. Now, you'll have to move round
to the right. Now follow me.  
MASTER: Stupid beast. Why doesn't it attack them?  
(The Master alters the amplitude of the transmission and the reptile heads for
the minefield. The Doctor and Jo reach an area where an unwary seagull has
previously set a mine off.)  
JO: Doctor, it's following us!  
(The reptile comes through the gaps made by the Doctor.)  
JO: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Relax, Jo, relax.  
(The Doctor adjustments the screwdriver and aims it back towards the reptile.
A nearby mine goes Bang! then another and another. It takes a fourth and fifth
to sent it screaming back to the waves. The Doctor retunes again.)  
DOCTOR: Right, follow me.

**[Naval base radio room]**

HART: Anything from the sub yet?  
BOWMAN: It's no good, sir, there's nothing.  
HART: They had instructions to surface over an hour ago.  
BLYTHE: Maybe they've found something, sir. Perhaps they're still
investigating.  
HART: If they haven't surfaced by now, then something must be stopping them.
All right, submiss procedure. Alert submarine command. We'll set up a full
scale search right away.  
BLYTHE: Sir.

**[Submarine]**

RATING [OC]: Submarine indicator buoys still won't release, sir.  
RIDGEWAY: All right, Summers. Radio Captain Hart the moment you surface. Tell
him we're immobilised on the sea bed by some unknown force and intruders have
broken through the hull.  
SUMMERS: Aye, aye, sir.  
(Summers is in an immersion suit, ready to escape the seabed.)  
RIDGEWAY: You've checked your R/T?  
SUMMERS: Yes, sir.  
RIDGEWAY: All right, carry on. Good luck.  
MITCHELL: Something's happening to this door, sir. It's getting hot.  
RIDGEWAY: Right, small arms, Number One.  
MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir.  
(Mitchell unbars and unlocks a cupboard.)  
SUMMERS: Forward hatch is jammed, sir.  
RIDGEWAY: All right, Summers.  
RIDGEWAY: Johnson, here. Petty Officer, here.  
(Small automatic weapons are handed out from the cupboard as a bulkhead starts
to melt.)  
RIDGEWAY: Right, take cover.  
MITCHELL: The door's going!  
RIDGEWAY: All right, Number One. Hold your fire until we see what they are.  
(A reptile comes through the molten remains of the bulkhead.)

**[The Master's cell]**

TRENCHARD: I just can't take it in. It's all too much for me.  
MASTER: Trenchard, you really must be more calm. Believe me, it's very simple.  
TRENCHARD: Simple? You've misled me all along. You said it was spies,
saboteurs. You said we'd catch them.  
MASTER: Look, if I had talked to you about sea monsters, would you have
believed me?  
TRENCHARD: I've risked everything to help you and you've lied to me.  
MASTER: I had to lie. Now sit down, Trenchard. Sit down and listen to me.  
TRENCHARD: I don't know how you can be so calm.  
MASTER: Now listen, that creature that you saw is one of a race of intelligent
reptiles that has a deadly hatred of mankind. Now somehow, they've established
themselves in the sea, but now they intend to emerge and conquer the Earth.  
TRENCHARD: What? We must warn the authorities at once!  
MASTER: No, no. Premature action would ruin everything.  
TRENCHARD: What else can we do?  
MASTER: Wait until this device of mine is perfected, and then tell the
authorities.

**[Castle grounds]**

(The Doctor and Jo run out from the trees and take cover behind a large shrub
at the sound of voices.)  
DOCTOR: Hold still. Hold still.  
(One guard on horseback, and two vehicles, come careering down the slope and
past them.)  
DOCTOR: Right. We've got to get back to Captain Hart. Come on.

**[The Master's cell]**

TRENCHARD: They're not in the beach sector. We've completely lost track of
them.  
MASTER: Trenchard, if they reach the naval base  
TRENCHARD: Exactly. They'll tell Hart everything.  
MASTER: Mind you, there's a good chance that he won't believe them, of course.  
TRENCHARD: But suppose he does? Suppose he turns up here again?  
MASTER: Refuse to admit him.  
TRENCHARD: Don't be ridiculous!  
MASTER: Trenchard, you are running a top security establishment here. Your
only responsibility is to the government.  
TRENCHARD: What about the Doctor? He'll report to UNIT. They can go to the
government.  
MASTER: Now look, you must trust me a little longer. I assure you all your
troubles will soon be over.

**[Submarine]**

(The submarine is once again underway. Ridgeway is plotting a course on one
map then walks over to the chart table.)  
RATING [OC]: Aft end flange space dry of water, sir.  
(The reptile takes Ridgeway's hand and points it to the Sea Fort on another
chart.)  
MITCHELL: Why there?  
RIDGEWAY: Ask Green Gilbert.  
MITCHELL: All right, old man. Get you there in no time! Er, sir, shall we take
a look at the pressure gauge, sir?  
RIDGEWAY: If you'll excuse me one moment?  
(Ridgeway and Mitchell go over to the periscope area.)  
MITCHELL: Sir, shouldn't we try and jump them?  
RIDGEWAY: No.  
MITCHELL: You mean we're going to do nothing at all?  
RIDGEWAY: Sooner or later, these things are going to return to their base. I
want to know where that is. Starboard twenty, Number One.

**[Hart's office]**

HART: I'm sorry if I seem to be repeating myself, Doctor, but I don't believe
a word of it!  
DOCTOR: Well, I can assure you we didn't walk ten miles across open
countryside just to tell you fairy stories.  
HART: Monsters coming out of the sea.  
JO: But it's different this time. Everybody saw it. Even Trenchard and the
guards.  
HART: And you think Trenchard will confirm your story?  
DOCTOR: I doubt it. The Master's got some sort of hold over him.  
JO: The Doctor's seen these creatures before.  
HART: Oh, I'm quite sure he has, Miss Grant.  
JO: In some caves in Derbyshire. You see, they want to take over the Earth  
HART: Oh, really, Miss Grant, if you think for one moment I'm going to believe  
JO: Well, re-take if you like, and what they're going to do is  
DOCTOR: All right, Jo, all right, all right. Let me deal with the
explanations. Look, it's like this  
(Blythe enters with a plate of sandwiches for Jo.)  
BLYTHE: Only cheese, I'm afraid. The best the steward could do.  
JO: Oh, that's super. Thanks very much.  
DOCTOR: For heaven's sakes, Jo. What do you think this is, a picnic?  
DOCTOR: All right, well let's forget about the Sea Devils. What about
Trenchard trying to take us prisoners then?  
(The Doctor eats Jo's sandwiches.)  
HART: Well, I only have your word for that, haven't I?  
DOCTOR: All right, what about the theft of your electronic spares? Surely
you'll agree that happened?  
HART: Since I was here at the time, yes.  
JO: The Master stole those parts to make his calling device, and  
HART: His what?  
DOCTOR: Well, he's developed some way of communicating with them. Probably a
ultra-high frequency sonic beam. These are rather good. Want one?  
HART: No, thank you.  
DOCTOR: Sandwich?  
BLYTHE: Thank you.  
JO: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so sorry.  
(Jo is left with the lettuce garnish. The telephone rings.)  
BLYTHE: Captain Hart's office? Oh, I see. Yes, yes, I'll tell him. They've had
to abandon the search, sir. They'll start again at first light.  
HART: Very well.  
BLYTHE: I'll get you some more sandwiches.  
JO: Thanks very much.  
(Blythe leaves.)  
DOCTOR: How overdue is the submarine?  
HART: Four hours.  
DOCTOR: It should never have been sent, you know. They were bound to presume
it was hostile.  
HART: Kindly leave the naval side of the operation to me, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Captain Hart, you are dealing with a situation completely outside of
your own experience. And if you won't let me help you  
HART: All right then, Doctor. What do you want me to do?  
DOCTOR: Well, the key to this whole situation is at the castle.  
(Bowman puts his head round the door to the radio room.)  
BOWMAN: Sir, I think we've got something.

**[Naval base radio room]**

HART: Where?  
BOWMAN: There, sir. Contact bearing two seven zero. Range, twenty thousand
yards. Heading zero four seven.  
JO: The submarine?  
HART: Could be.  
BOWMAN: I think it must be, sir.  
DOCTOR: You see where the thing's heading? That beach by castle! Perhaps
you'll believe me now.

**[The Master's cell]**

(The Master has his device running on yet another frequency, that sounds like
very speeded up speech. Then he switches off, taps at a bank of eight keys and
switches on again. Off, more keying, and Trenchard enters.)  
TRENCHARD: That thing working all right?  
MASTER: It still needs a few minor adjustments, that's all.  
TRENCHARD: Look, I've been giving some thought to all this. It's going to be
an enormous job coping with these creatures. We must give the authorities all
the notice we can.  
(The device emits more speeded up speech and the Master unplugs it.)  
TRENCHARD: What was that?  
MASTER: Just random feedback. It's nothing important.  
TRENCHARD: Sounded like some sort of message.  
MASTER: Look, Trenchard, I am trying to carry out a very difficult and complex
task here, and I can't work if I'm being continually interrupted.  
TRENCHARD: I'm terribly sorry, old chap. I'll leave you to it.  
MASTER: Thank you.  
TRENCHARD: Yes. (Trenchard leaves. The Master plugs the machine back in and
the message comes tumbling out. He smiles. Under cover of darkness, six
reptiles are walking through the surf to the shore. Further out, six more are
emerging from the depths.)

**[Governor's office]**

TRENCHARD: (into phone) I tell you I must speak to the Minister. It's most
important. Well, when do you expect him back? No, I can't tell you what's
wrong. The security of the nation is at risk. Oh, very well, I'll hold on, but
please hurry!  
(In a corridor, a guard spots a melted lock and looks at it. A reptile grabs
him from behind and breaks his neck.)  
TRENCHARD: (into phone) No, it can't wait till the morning. Oh, you'll have to
interrupt his meeting. This is a matter of national urgency. Oh, very well, as
soon as he's free then. But if there's any unnecessary delay, believe me,
you'll answer for it.  
(Trenchard turns on the monitor and watches the Master tapping the keys on his
device. He turns it off and picks up an internal telephone.)  
TRENCHARD: Guard?  
(Elsewhere, a telephone smashes on the floor and a guard falls next to it.
Trenchard unlocks a drawer in his desk and takes out his service revolver,
checking that it is loaded.

**[Castle]**

(A patrol of two guards encounter two reptiles in a corridor, and one man
manages to set off the alarm. Guards and Trenchard run through corridors, guns
at the ready. Reptiles kill two guards and make their way through the building
to the Master's cell. Trenchard comes across Drew firing at something.)  
TRENCHARD: What's happening, man?  
DREW: They're all over the place, sir! They killed most of the lads!  
TRENCHARD: Who? Who's attacking us?  
DREW: Lizards, sir. Like that thing we saw on the beach. Come on, sir. They
were after me.  
TRENCHARD: Pull yourself together, man. Have you sent for help?  
DREW: But it's no good, sir!  
TRENCHARD: There's a direct line to Whitehall in my office. Use that.  
DREW: Why can't you, sir?  
TRENCHARD: I shall attend to the security of my prisoner. Go on, man. Move!  
(Drew leaves. Trenchard faces three reptiles and empties his revolver into one
of them, which clutches its chest. The clock on the wall says it is just after
9.00 when the Master stops sending his message, and the three reptiles enter
his cell. Trenchard lies dead on the floor outside.)

**[Naval base radio room]**

(Bowman has been sending a morse signal.)  
BOWMAN: No, it's no good, sir. Nothing.  
JO: Well, if that thing was the submarine, why don't they answer your signals?  
DOCTOR: Perhaps they can't.  
HART: Tell the search coordinator to check that area immediately. It'll be
light soon.  
BLYTHE: Sir.  
BOWMAN: Sir, contact fading.  
HART: What?  
DOCTOR: Captain Hart, we've got to find out what's happening at that castle.  
BOWMAN: Contact lost.  
HART: I want an armed party and two Land Rovers at the main gate in four
minutes flat. Doctor?

**[Outside the Castle entrance]**

(Two Navy Land Rovers arrive.)  
HART: Come on. Follow in.

**[Castle]**

(The group come across a dead guard.)  
HART: Doctor!  
(He has spotted Trenchard's body.)  
HART: I don't understand why.  
DOCTOR: The Master had no further use for him, that's why.  
HART: But why did he help the Master in the first place?  
DOCTOR: What would you say was Trenchard's strongest characteristic?  
HART: Oh, I don't know. Patriotism, I suppose.  
DOCTOR: Exactly. And the Master used that patriotism as a weapon.

**[Naval base radio room]**

(Bowman is filling in a message form when Blythe enters with a mug.)  
BLYTHE: I've bought you some kai.  
BOWMAN: Roger, search force. Over and out. Did you get through to Captain
Hart?  
BLYTHE: I telephoned the castle but they've already left.  
BOWMAN: Well, they're definitely getting an echo and the object's moving.  
BLYTHE: I see.  
HART: What is it, Bowman? Have they re-established contact?  
BOWMAN: It's a message from one of the search vessels, sir. They are getting
an echo.  
DOCTOR: The submarine?  
BOWMAN: Yes, it's moving towards the fort now. Moving at about thirty knots.  
HART: Depth?  
BOWMAN: Steady at one five zero feet.  
DOCTOR: The fort. Look, Captain Hart, can you lay on a diving vessel?  
HART: Yes, the Reclaim's standing by on the search. But why?  
DOCTOR: I want to inspect the sea bed at the base of that fort.

**[HMS Reclaim dive control]**

(The Doctor and Jo are ferried out in a launch to the Royal Navy's diving and
search ship, A23, who sadly no longer exists. The Doctor is piped aboard. and
they go down to the diver's section where the tanks and dry suits are kept.)  
HART: All pre-dive checks completed?  
WATTS: Yes. sir.  
HART: Doctor, are you quite sure you want to go through with this?  
DOCTOR: Yes, positive.  
HART: Ready to lower the observation chamber?  
WATTS: Yes, sir. The crew is standing by. We'll send a man down with him.  
HART: Good.  
DOCTOR: If you don't mind, I'd rather go down on my own.  
HART: Well, I presume you're a trained diver in addition to your other
accomplishments then, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Naturally. What's more, I know these creatures. I've encountered them
before so I know what I'm looking for.  
HART: All right, carry on.  
WATTS: Aye, aye, sir.  
JO: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: What is it, Jo?  
JO: Is it really necessary for you to go down?  
DOCTOR: How else am I going to make contact?  
HART: Doctor?

**[HMS Reclaim]**

(The diving bell is waiting, hanging from its crane on deck.)  
HART: Well, good luck, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Thank you, Captain Hart.

**[Diving bell]**

(The Doctor climbs up into the bell.)  
C.P.O: Everything okay, sir?  
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Chief.  
C.P.O: Very good.

**[HMS Reclaim]**

WATTS: Test the links.  
(The crew make their final checks and then the crane hoists the bell over the
side.)  
WATTS: Pull up the links. Carry on lowering.  
(The bell enters the water.)  
SAILOR: Twelve feet.  
OFFICER: Carry on lowering.

**[HMS Reclaim dive control]**

HART: Let me speak to him. How's it going, Doctor?  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Splendid, thank you. A most interesting trip.  
HART: You'll reach seabed in a few minutes. Tell us immediately if anything
goes wrong.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Don't worry. I'll be all right.  
HART: You have reached seabed.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Right.  
HART: Are you all right, Doctor?

**[Diving bell]**

DOCTOR: Yes, I'm fine, thank you.  
(The Doctor peers out of a porthole.)  
DOCTOR: Hang on a minute!  
(And a reptile peers in.)

**[HMS Reclaim dive control]**

HART: Are you all right, Doctor? Shall we bring you up?  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Definitely not! I think I've just (static)  
HART: Bring him up!  
WATTS: Start winches! Hoist SCC!

**[HMS Reclaim]**

OFFICER: High enough. Stop the lift.  
(The bell is pulled into the deck and locked off in its original position.
Hart looks inside then comes out again. Jo meets his eyes then looks inside
the bell for herself. It is empty.)

__**Episode Five**__

**[HMS Reclaim]**

JO: He's gone!  
(Somewhere else, a much smaller and very alien diving bell is being lowered in
the Sea Devils base. Watching the operation is one reptile wearing a fishnet
cloak as well as the tunic. It gestures and a plug is removed from the side of
the bell, dragging cables out with it, and revealing the Doctor's face.)

**[Hart's office]**

(A man in camel hair coat and bowler hat enters.)  
WALKER: Good morning, my dear. Captain Hart here?  
BLYTHE: No sir, he's at sea.  
WALKER: Well, I suppose that's the right place for a sailor, eh? What's your
name?  
BLYTHE: Blythe, sir.  
WALKER: Walker. Parliamentary Private Secretary. Any chance of any breakfast?  
BLYTHE: I'll call the steward, sir.  
WALKER: Excellent!

**[Naval base radio room]**

WALKER: And, er, who are you?  
BOWMAN: Leading Telegraphist Bowman, sir.  
WALKER: Jolly good. Er, nothing very elaborate, my dear. Just eggs, bacon,
toast, coffee. Oh, and a little rough-cut marmalade, if they've got it. How
long is he likely to be? Captain Hart, I mean.  
BLYTHE: I don't know, sir.  
WALKER: Oh, well, now, I tell you what. You get him on your jolly old wireless
and ask him to come over here at the double, will you?  
(Walker goes back into the office.)  
BLYTHE: Send a signal to Captain Hart. Tell him that a Mister Walker is here
to see him.  
WALKER: Parliamentary Private Secretary.  
BOWMAN: Er, aye aye, sir.

**[Hart's office]**

BLYTHE: I'll call the steward.  
WALKER: Ah, and get me the morning papers, will you, there's a good girl.  
BLYTHE: If I may ask, sir, what is the purpose of your visit?  
WALKER: Why, all those ships sinking. I've come down to clear it up for you.
The Minister's put me in full charge.

**[Sea Devil's base]**

SEA DEVIL: This is our planet. My people ruled the Earth when man was only an
ape.  
(The Doctor is out of the bell.)  
DOCTOR: Your people went into hibernation and abandoned Earth to its fate.  
SEA DEVIL: Our astronomers predicted that a great catastrophe would end all
life on the face of the Earth.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but the catastrophe that you predicted never happened. And the
apes that you left behind on the surface to die became man.  
SEA DEVIL: You know our history?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I've encountered your people before. That is why I want to
prevent a conflict that can only end in your destruction.  
SEA DEVIL: We shall destroy man and reclaim the planet. Already we have begun
to sink his ships.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and already more ships are being sent to hunt you down.  
SEA DEVIL: The submarine? We have captured it.  
DOCTOR: You may win a few victories to begin with but eventually you're bound
to lose.  
SEA DEVIL: There are many thousands of our people in hibernation in this base.
We have other colonies hidden all round the world. We shall be the victors in
the war against mankind.  
DOCTOR: But there's no need for a war. Why can't you share the planet?  
SEA DEVIL: That would be impossible.  
DOCTOR: The depths of the sea and those areas on Earth where man cannot live
can be yours.  
SEA DEVIL: And man would agree to that?  
DOCTOR: There's a chance. Wouldn't it be better to try for a peace, than to
launch yourself into a war that you cannot possibly win?  
SEA DEVIL: I will consider what you have said.  
DOCTOR: Let me return to the humans, and I will endeavour to make a peace for
you.  
SEA DEVIL: Perhaps it would be possible.  
MASTER: No! The Doctor is your deadly enemy! He must be destroyed!

**[Hart's office]**

(Walker sits at Hart's desk, stirring his tea.)  
WALKER: Captain Hart, there's only one way to deal with this problem. You have
to attack. Ugh. Oh, pass me the sugar, my dear, will you?  
HART: My submarine is missing in that area. There's a chance that some of the
crew may still be alive.  
JO: And what about the Doctor? He may still be alive down there too!  
HART: Yes.  
WALKER: Well, this is war, my dear, and war calls for sacrifice. Any chance of
any more toast, my dear?  
BLYTHE: Yes, sir.  
(Blythe takes the toast rack and leaves.)  
WALKER: Now, I've had a look at that UNIT file about the creatures that your
friend the Doctor encountered in those caves. And do you know what happened?
Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart blew the whole lot up.  
JO: Maybe, but I bet he didn't do it by risking the lives of his own men.  
WALKER: Well, that's as maybe, but our line is quite clear. Immediate
retaliation with everything that we've got.  
HART: I'm sorry, sir. I don't agree.  
WALKER: Your opinion is quite immaterial, Captain Hart. The order's already
been given. Ships are converging on this area from ports all over England.  
HART: You're throwing away the lives of the men in that submarine, sir!  
JO: And you'll probably killed the Doctor. Look, do you realise that that's
murder?  
WALKER: Murder? War always is, my dear. Where on Earth's that girl with my
toast?

**[Flag ship]**

(The Rear Admiral dictates a message from the lead ship of the flotilla.)  
ADMIRAL: Make this to Ministry of Defence Navy. Special Task Force will be in
position at thirteen fifty. That's all. Thank you.

**[Sea Devil's base]**

DOCTOR: I beg you not to listen to this man. He's the personification of evil.  
SEA DEVIL: The Master is our friend.  
DOCTOR: He wants only to provoke a war.  
MASTER: I do not! I came here to help you revive your people.  
DOCTOR: Why should you need his help?  
SEA DEVIL: Our hibernation unit is faulty.  
MASTER: And I can now repair it for you.  
DOCTOR: But why revive your people only to have them killed? Let me try and
negotiate that peace for you.  
MASTER: As you did before, Doctor? The last time this man encountered your
race, he tricked them. The humans destroyed them all.  
SEA DEVIL: Is that true?  
DOCTOR: Yes. I tried to make peace but I failed.  
MASTER: You see? He admits it. Man is weak. Your conquest will be easy.  
DOCTOR: Believe me, man is not weak. He's only too proficient at devising
weapons of annihilation and using them.  
SEA DEVIL: He says man is weak. He says man is strong.  
MASTER: He's lying! He's trying to frighten you!  
SEA DEVIL: No. I do not think he lies. Perhaps it would be better to make
peace. I shall have consider what you have said.  
MASTER: Don't trust him!  
(The Doctor raises his right hand and the sea devil puts its own hand against
it.)

**[Flag ship]**

(Meanwhile, the task force prepares for battle, readying torpedoes and gun
batteries.)  
ADMIRAL: Inform Ministry of Defence. Task Force now in position and ready to
attack.  
CPO: Aye, aye, sir.

**[Naval base radio room]**

BOWMAN: Roger Task Force. Over and out.  
WALKER: What is it?  
HART: The Task Force is in position, sir.  
WALKER: Excellent! Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war, hmm? Well, tell
them to carry out their orders. The attack will go ahead now.  
JO: No! Look, please, you've got to do something! Can't you stop him?  
HART: I wish you'd reconsider, sir.  
WALKER: Captain Hart, I have full authority. Now, are you going to carry out
my order or must I replace you with someone who will?  
HART: I'm sorry, Jo.

**[Flag ship]**

ADMIRAL: Commence attack.  
(E124 comes hard a-port and the gunnery section gets busy.)  
OFFICER: Urgent attack. In the bracket.  
(Barrages of depth charges are fired and plumes of water are sent high into
the air. No debris.)

**[Sea Devil's base]**

SEA DEVIL: You will negotiate a truce between my people and the humans.  
DOCTOR: If you'll release the submarine and its crew, yes, as a gesture of
good faith.  
SEA DEVIL: Very well.  
MASTER: You are throwing away the control of this planet! The humans will
never make peace with you!  
(Boom! as a depth charge finds its target and sends everyone staggering. The
barrage continues, knocking them to the floor.)  
MASTER: Is this the promised peace? Can't you see that the humans are
determined to wipe you out?  
SEA DEVIL: You are right! These apes cannot be trusted! Take him away and kill
him!  
(The Doctor is taken away down a dark passage as the barrage continues. He
manages to get free of his escort just before a section of roof comes down on
them. He goes back to one of the crushed reptiles, brushes off the sand and
rock, and takes its weapon.)  
SEA DEVIL: Destroy the ships!  
MASTER: No! Send your people down to the lower level. They'll be safe there.  
SEA DEVIL: We must retaliate.  
MASTER: Not yet. If I am to revive your people, I need time.  
SEA DEVIL: What would you have us do?  
MASTER: Convince the humans that their attack has been a success.

**[Flag ship]**

(A Lieutenant Commander is scanning the attack area.)  
OFFICER: Sir?  
(The Admiral takes a look, and sees two dead reptiles floating in the water.)

**[Naval base]**

BOWMAN: Roger, Task Force.

**[Hart's office]**

BOWMAN: Sir? Signal from Task Force. They report bodies and debris coming to
the surface.  
JO: Bodies? Did they say  
BOWMAN: No, Miss, just the lizard things.  
HART: We can call off the attack now, sir.  
WALKER: Well, I'm not sure.  
JO: Look, you've probably killed the Doctor and all those sailors. Aren't you
satisfied?  
HART: There is a chance there might be some survivors. Would you want it said
that you unnecessarily endangered the lives of naval personnel, sir?  
WALKER: All right. Have it your own way.

**[Naval base radio room]**

HART: Make to Task Force. Abandon attack.  
BOWMAN: (big grin) Aye, aye, sir.

**[Flag ship]**

ADMIRAL: Cease fire.

**[Sea Devil's base]**

(A wall monitor shows the position of four surface vessels.)  
MASTER: You see? My plan has worked.  
SEA DEVIL: We could still destroy their ships before they are out of range.  
MASTER: No, let them go. Let them think that they have won.  
(The Master and the chief reptile touch hands, or gloves.)  
SEA DEVIL: You will now revive the rest of my people.  
MASTER: Yes, but first the trigger mechanism on your reactivation unit is
faulty. I need electronic equipment to build a new one.  
SEA DEVIL: And where will you obtain this?  
MASTER: The humans will provide it. We shall attack their base.

**[Sea Devil's base - detention area]**

(The Doctor enters a section containing a reptile lying on the floor and some
electronic equipment, and a survival suit from the submarine. In an adjoining
cell, the submarine's First Officer is trying to force open a door with a
small porthole in it using just a small knife.)  
RIDGEWAY: Optimistic, Number One, but I admire your pluck. Here, give it to
me.  
MITCHELL: Would you like to try, sir?  
(The Doctor appears in the port hole.)  
DOCTOR: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Er, look, would you mind keeping back for a
moment? That is if you want to get out? Thank you!  
(The Doctor uses the sea devil weapon to blast open the door.)  
RIDGEWAY: Who the blazes are you?  
DOCTOR: Look, I've no time to explain now. Where are the rest of your men?  
RIDGEWAY: Still in the submarine.  
DOCTOR: Is the submarine still operational?  
RIDGEWAY: Should be.  
MITCHELL: They've ripped out the communicators and the escape gear, as you can
see.  
RIDGEWAY: But left the engines alone.  
MITCHELL: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Where's the sub now?  
RIDGEWAY: In a kind of undersea harbour.  
DOCTOR: Can you find the way?  
RIDGEWAY: I think so, yes.  
DOCTOR: Right, you'd better lead on. Here, take this. It's a gun. Now come on,
let's hurry.

**[Submarine]**

(One reptile is standing guard as the crewmen play pontoon.)  
SUMMERS: What about you, Chris?  
LOVELL: I'll stick.  
SUMMERS: You?  
GIRTON: Twist. I'll stick.  
SUMMERS: Right. Ha! Pay twenties.  
GIRTON: Eighteen,  
LOVELL: Nineteen. Well, that's it then. You've cleared me right out.  
SUMMERS: What about you? Do you want to go on?  
GIRTON: Not bothered.  
(There is a banging on the hull. Rhythmic, morse code type banging.)  
LOVELL: What's that?  
SUMMERS: Er, loose rigging.  
LOVELL: Rigging?  
SUMMERS: Yeah, what about a game of consequences? Yeah, I'll start.  
(Summers writes on a pad until the banging stops, then hands the paper to
Girton.)  
SUMMERS: Right, it's your turn. Er, you've got to do what it says there.  
LOVELL: That's not how you play consequences.  
SUMMERS: It's the way we play.  
LOVELL: Oh.  
(Girton clutches his stomach and groans. Summers gestures him to get louder.)  
LOVELL: What's the matter with him?  
SUMMERS: He's throwing a fit!  
(The reptile comes over.)  
SUMMERS: Here, can't you see? He's not well.  
(The reptile bends to look at Girton's face. Summers and Lovell attack but are
thrown off as Ridgeway, with the weapon, and the Doctor come down the ladder.)  
DOCTOR: No, no! Don't kill him!  
(Ridgeway fires anyway.)  
DOCTOR: There's no need to have done that!  
RIDGEWAY: Any more of them, Summers?  
SUMMERS: Yes, there's some more on guard up top, sir.  
RIDGEWAY: We've dealt with them already. Right, action stations! We're getting
under way.  
(Ridgeway tosses the weapon over his shoulder to Mitchell.)  
MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir.

**[Sea Devil's base]**

(Back at the detention area the reptile wakes and sees that the two officers
have broken out of their cell. It raises the alarm as the submarine's
propeller starts turning.)  
SEA DEVIL: The humans have escaped.  
MASTER: The submarine! They'll try to recapture it.  
SEA DEVIL: Activate the force field!

**[Submarine]**

(The submarine is part way out of a rock face cave when the bright forcefield
comes on.)  
MITCHELL: Sir, we've stopped moving.  
RIDGEWAY: Increase revolutions.  
MITCHELL: Maximum revs, sir.  
DOCTOR: They're holding us back with some kind of force field.

**[Sea Devil's base]**

(The monitor shows the submarine being pushed back through the rock face.)  
SEA DEVIL: They cannot escape us now.

**[Submarine]**

RIDGEWAY: There must be something we can do?  
DOCTOR: Well, you could try firing your torpedoes at the cave wall and
blasting yourselves free.  
MITCHELL: We're still halfway in the cave, sir. We could blow ourselves up.  
DOCTOR: That's a risk you'll have to take.  
RIDGEWAY: Forward ends, this is the Captain. Load all bow tubes. Open one and
two bow caps.

**[Sea Devil's base]**

SEA DEVIL: Increase the force field.

**[Submarine]**

RIDGEWAY: The engines. We're losing power.  
DOCTOR: Well, hurry up and fire those torpedoes, or we'll be drawn back into
the cave.  
RATING [OC]: All bow heads open. Ready to fire, sir.  
DOCTOR: Well, come on, man! You've got to risk it!  
RIDGEWAY: Stand by bow salvo.  
RATING [OC]: Standing by, sir.  
RIDGEWAY: Fire one. Fire two.  
(Boom! and the submarine shoots backwards out of the cave.)

**[Sea Devil's base]**

SEA DEVIL: Increase the force field. They must not escape.  
MASTER: It's no use. You're already too late.

**[Submarine]**

RIDGEWAY: Any damage forward, Chief?  
SUMMERS: No damage to tell, sir.  
RIDGEWAY: Thank you. All right, stand by to surface, Number One. MITCHELL:
Aye, aye, sir.  
RIDGEWAY: We're going home.

**[Sea Devil's base]**

(The monitor shows the submarine making good speed.)  
SEA DEVIL: They can tell the humans how to find our base.  
MASTER: It's of no importance. Before they can attack us we shall attack them.

**[Hart's office]**

JO: Doctor! I thought you were dead!  
DOCTOR: Dead? No, I don't think so.  
JO: When I saw that thing come up empty, I thought I'd never see you again.  
WALKER: Well, well, well, so the heroes have returned.  
DOCTOR: Captain Hart, what idiot ordered an all out attack just as I was on
the verge of finding a peaceful solution?  
JO: But it wasn't Captain Hart's fault. It was this  
HART: I'm terribly sorry. This is Mister Walker. He's the Parliamentary
Private Secretary in charge of this business.  
WALKER: I'm the idiot you've just been talking about. Absolutely splendid
lunch, old man.  
DOCTOR: You ordered the attack?  
WALKER: I did.  
DOCTOR: Did you give any thought at all, sir, as to what you were doing?  
WALKER: Our duty is to destroy the Queen's enemies. Don't you know your
national anthem? Confound their politics, frustrate their knavish tricks.  
DOCTOR: That, sir, is an extremely insular point of view. At the precise
moment of the attack, I was negotiating a peace.  
WALKER: Peace? Huh. What, when they've been attacking our shipping and heaven
alone knows what? I think you've got it all wrong, old man. Seek and destroy.
That's what you chaps say, isn't it?  
DOCTOR: But the point, Mister Parliamentary Private Secretary, is that you
have not destroyed. You have just made them angry. Very, very angry!  
(So angry that hordes of reptiles are now emerging from the sea, taking out
the lone sentry on the beach and making their way through the base unopposed.)  
WALKER: I'm going to get on to the Minister, and I'm going to ask him to seek
approval for an immediate attack with nuclear weapons.  
DOCTOR: But that, sir, would be tantamount to murder.  
WALKER: Oh, come, come, Doctor. You speak as if these creatures are human.
We're not going to hand over the world to a lot of lizards, you know.  
DOCTOR: You can share it with them, surely?  
WALKER: Oh, come. Really, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Look, let me make one final attempt to negotiate.  
WALKER: Well, you didn't get very far last time, did you?  
DOCTOR: Just you think of it, sir. Think of it. Wouldn't you like to be the
man behind a peaceful settlement? Walker the peacemaker, they'd call you. Or
would you prefer to be known as the man responsible for launching a full scale
war!  
WALKER: Look, you can actually communicate with these creatures?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
WALKER: And you'd be willing to undertake the preliminary negotiations
yourself?  
DOCTOR: Just leave it to me.  
JO: Doctor, you're not thinking of going down there again?  
DOCTOR: Jo, it's the only way.  
JO: But, Doctor, it's far too dangerous!  
DOCTOR: Don't you understand, Jo? I've got to go down there of my own free
will as a gesture of good faith. Captain Hart, is that diving vessel still
alongside?  
HART: Yes, but I must say that I agree with Miss Grant.  
DOCTOR: Then with your permission, Mister Walker? (to Blythe) My cape.

**[Naval base]**

HART: Doctor, do you think you're doing the right thing?  
DOCTOR: I'm doing the only thing possible, Captain Hart, if we're to avoid a
major conflict.  
HART: Suppose they won't listen to you?  
JO: Doctor!  
(A reptile raises its weapon at them.)

__**Episode Six**__

**[Naval base]**

(Without hesitation, the Doctor runs to the reptile, knocks the weapon out of
its hand and slams its head against a nearby wall. A second reptile gets a
double-handed punch to the midsection then jaw.)  
DOCTOR: All right, Captain Hart, get these two out of here.  
JO: Doctor, look out!  
(Another reptile grabs the Doctor's neck from behind and puts pressure on. He
blacks out. More reptiles arrive and raise their weapons.)  
MASTER: No! No, take them inside.  
(Hart and Jo half-carry the Doctor back to the main building.)  
MASTER: Dear, oh dear, Doctor. Will you never learn?  
(All over the base, naval personnel are being rounded up and shut in building
289.)

**[Outside Hart's office]**

MASTER: Now, Doctor, for your information the capture of this naval base is
the first step in the return of this planet to its rightful owners. Right,
bring him in, will you?

**[Hart's office]**

DOCTOR: How do you hope to achieve that?  
MASTER: As you know, our friends here have underground and underwater bases
all over the world. Well, I propose to reactivate them.  
DOCTOR: You haven't reactivated them yet, have you.  
MASTER: Er, not yet, no. But I can, with your help.  
DOCTOR: I wondered why I was still alive.  
MASTER: I advise you not to give me any trouble, Doctor. Not if you value the
life of every man on this base.

**[Naval base radio room]**

(Hart tries the radio.)  
HART: It's no good! They've cut the power supply!  
JO: Shush! Look, there's still some of them in there.  
WALKER: This is monstrous! What are you going to do about it, Captain Hart?  
JO: Captain Hart, what about this?  
(Jo points at a hatch in the ceiling.)  
HART: Yes, we should be able to open it. But I could never get through the
ventilation shaft up there.  
JO: No, but I could.  
HART: The table.  
JO: Right.  
HART: Here.  
(They clear equipment from a table.)  
WALKER: What, what are you doing?  
HART: We are going to put this table underneath that ventilation hatch and try
to open it.  
WALKER: Yes, but supposing you get caught? They might take reprisals against
the innocent!  
(Hart climbs onto the table.)  
HART: A screwdriver. Jo, over there on the bench somewhere.  
JO: Right.  
WALKER: Don't you think we ought to leave these things to the Doctor? He said
we ought to cooperate with them, you know?  
HART: Tool kit. Underneath. Underneath the bench.  
WALKER: Look, he's, er, he's not going to try and trick them, is he?  
JO: Shush!  
HART: That's it.  
WALKER: This could have the most dreadful consequences! He, he, he made them a
promise, you know.  
HART: Yes, in order to save our lives! Now do you mind?

**[Naval base stores]**

(The Master gets their reptile escort to wait outside.)  
MASTER: Now then, Doctor, my problem is this. During millions of years of
hibernation, the reactivation machinery has deteriorated. I now find it
necessary to build a trigger mechanism for it.  
DOCTOR: And how do you hope to do that?  
MASTER: Well, by constructing a sonar device analogous to the laser. With
this, I can not only pinpoint and revive the base by the sea fort, but every
other base in the world.  
DOCTOR: And you've convinced your reptilian friends that this will work?  
MASTER: You know it'll work, with your cooperation. All the equipment we need
is here.  
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I suppose it's possible.  
MASTER: I've drawn up some preliminary plans here. There.  
DOCTOR: Good grief! What on Earth do you think you're doing?  
MASTER: Why? What is the matter?  
DOCTOR: Well, this circuit here, it's completely misplaced. And also you'll
need far more power through to your main dipode. Give me a pencil, will you?  
MASTER: There you are.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
MASTER: And you think you can correct this fault?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so, given time. Now then, let's see.

**[Naval base radio room]**

WALKER: Are you, are you really going to let a mere child risk her life?  
HART: Well I could never get through that ventilation shaft. Would you like to
try? Come on, Jo. Now, once you're through the shaft, there's a hatch that
comes out onto the roof of this building.  
JO: Okay.  
HART: Are you ready? Hup.  
(Hart lifts Jo into the shaft.)  
HART: That's it.  
(Jo drags herself along on her stomach to the grill on the roof amidst an
array of aerials, and radar and microwave dishes. Avoiding a pair of reptiles
she climbs down a ladder to the ground and runs through the base until she
sees something through the window of -)

**[Naval base stores]**

(The Master is working on the device and the Doctor is collecting parts. He
pauses for a moment when he sees something at the window, then carries on.)  
MASTER: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I need a polarising condenser.  
MASTER: Oh, allow me.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.  
(The Master goes to the rear room of the stores. Jo lifts the upper part of
the window.)  
JO: (sotto) Come on, Doctor! Hurry!  
(The Doctor checks that the Master is out of sight then goes to the window.)  
JO: (sotto) Come on!  
DOCTOR: Now Jo, listen to me. In a few minutes time, I'm going to create a
diversion. Now, as soon as it starts, you try and get Hart and the others out.  
JO: But what about the guards?  
DOCTOR: Don't worry about the guards. You leave them to me. Now, you hurry
back there and wait for the off.  
JO: Okay.  
(The Doctor returns to the workbench. Jo starts to run back to the main
building, but has to turn and run the other way as a reptile patrol
approaches. A little while later, the trigger mechanism is about complete.)  
DOCTOR: All right?  
(The Doctor plugs it in to the mains. Jo is back in the main building. A
reptile enters the stores.)  
MASTER: Well, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: How about a little test? Right, here goes.  
(The Doctor switches it on and the reptile clutches its head in agony.

**[Hart's office]**

(So does the one in Hart's office so Jo runs through and opens the radio room
door to release Hart and Walker.)  
HART: What the blazes?  
JO: The Doctor's doing it. Now come on, quickly, please.  
(Walker can't bring himself to push past the suffering reptile, and goes back
into the radio room.)

**[Naval base]**

(Hart and Jo leave the main building, past two more writhing reptiles. They
come across a fallen Marine and Hart takes his rifle.)  
HART: We must find the hovercraft pilot. JO: It's all right. I can fly one.
Come on!

**[Naval base beach]**

(A hovercraft - SRN5 - is sitting on the shingle. Hart shoots at a group of
approaching reptiles while Jo gets into the pilot's seat and starts it up. He
manages to kill them before the hovercraft's skirts inflate and they glide
down onto the sea.)

**[Naval base stores]**

MASTER: Switch the power off!  
(The Master pulls the plug out of the wall and the reptile stands still.)  
MASTER: What happened?  
DOCTOR: I must have had the frequency too high. I'm sorry about that. Oh, no,
I see what it is. I had the output jack in the input socket. There. Yeah,
there that should work all right now.  
MASTER: We shan't know for sure till we get it back to their base and build it
into their power system.  
DOCTOR: We?  
MASTER: Yes, Doctor. You're coming with me.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I see.  
(The reptile leader is escorted in.)  
SEA DEVIL: This noise, what has been happening?  
MASTER: Teething troubles, that's all.  
SEA DEVIL: It must not happen again. Is the work completed?  
MASTER: Yes, I've now finished.  
SEA DEVIL: Then we shall return to our base. Do you want him killed now?  
MASTER: No. He might yet prove useful. Well, Doctor? Shall we go?  
DOCTOR: If you insist.

**[Naval base]**

(The leader sees the hovercraft heading for the base.)  
SEA DEVIL: Guard them. Keep them safe. I must alert the others.  
(The Master and the Doctor are locked back in the stores. The hovercraft lands
and Hart leads a troop of marines onto the beach and the battle for the base
begins. Despite the difference in weaponry, the marines have the upper hand
and are cutting down reptiles far more quickly than they take casualties of
their own.)

**[Naval base stores]**

DOCTOR: Well, it seems as if things aren't quite going according to plan.  
MASTER: Look, we must break out of here! I've got to get this device down to
your base.  
OFFICER [OC]: Myers, check that storeroom!  
(The reptile puts the Master behind him as the door opens and a Petty Officer
looks in.)  
MYERS: Looks all right.  
DOCTOR: Look out behind you!  
(Myers puts five rounds rapid into the reptile.)  
MYERS: Would one of you gentlemen be the Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. This man is an extremely dangerous criminal, so guard him
well. Now, have you seen Captain Hart and Miss Grant?  
MYERS: I'm not sure, sir.  
DOCTOR: Right, I'd better go and find them.  
MYERS: Right, I'll stay with this bloke.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, do that. And watch him!  
(The Doctor leaves. Myers keeps his rifle leveled at the Master.)  
MASTER: There's been a misunderstanding here, you know. I'm not the man that
you want. There's been a mistake.  
(Myers gets treated to a full Look.)  
MASTER: You understand? A mistake.  
(The Master pushes the rifle barrel aside and hits Myers hard.)  
MASTER: A mistake!

**[Naval base]**

(Hart and a rating load a two inch gun emplacement and use it against a troop
of reptiles. The Doctor arrives.)  
DOCTOR: Have you seen Jo Grant anywhere?  
HART: She's on the beach.  
(The Doctor sees the Master run through the gate onto the beach, carrying the
trigger mechanism.)

**[Beach and sea]**

(There are a pair of bright orange one-man jet boats just above the surf line.
The Master puts the mechanism in one and launches it. The Doctor runs down the
beach to the second and launches that, giving chase. The reptile leader and
his surviving warriors run into the sea. The Master beaches his craft on
another sandy beach and the Doctor catches up to him.)  
MASTER: I'm sorry, Doctor.  
(The Master points to a reptile diving bell, then six reptiles come over the
dunes.)

**[Hart's office]**

WALKER: Now, perhaps you'll admit I was right all along. Massive nuclear
strike. It's the only way.  
JO: But not until we know what's happened to the Doctor.  
BLYTHE: Excuse me, sir. I've just seen Lieutenant Scott. He said he saw the
Doctor heading out to sea.  
WALKER: Ha ha, gone to join his friends. Gone over to the other side.  
BLYTHE: He seemed to be chasing another boat.  
JO: He must have been after the Master.  
WALKER: Well, be that as it may, they'll both have to take their chances. I'm
going to put an end to these creatures right away. Kindly get me the Minister
on the phone. I'm going to request that we launch a nuclear strike. Now.

**[Sea Devil's base]**

(The Master and the Doctor are attaching the trigger mechanism to the
reptile's hibernation equipment.)  
SEA DEVIL: We want revenge on the human species. Many of my people have been
killed.  
MASTER: It was a necessary sacrifice.  
SEA DEVIL: You said man was weak.  
MASTER: So he is. Soon you will surge from the seas in your millions and
exterminate him.  
DOCTOR: Don't listen to him. Why begin a long and bloody war where thousands
will be killed on both sides?  
SEA DEVIL: We shall destroy man and reclaim the planet.  
DOCTOR: Is there nothing I can say to make you reconsider?  
SEA DEVIL: Nothing!  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.  
SEA DEVIL: Is the machine ready?  
MASTER: It is.  
(The Doctor adjusts a lever on the top.)  
SEA DEVIL: Then activate it.  
MASTER: Allow me, Doctor. We don't want any accidents this time.  
DOCTOR: The power may take some time to build up, you know.  
(The Master switches the trigger mechanism on.)  
MASTER: I suggest you now dispose of this man.  
SEA DEVIL: Take them both to the cages.  
MASTER: What's the meaning of this? I'm your ally!  
SEA DEVIL: Both, I say! Take them!  
MASTER: I helped you! I helped you!  
(An armada of surface vessels and submarines are approaching the Solent.)  
MASTER: Look, I demand you take me back to your chief! Immediately!  
DOCTOR: You seem to be losing your touch.

**[Sea Devil's base - cell]**

MASTER: Once they see that the device works properly, they'll release me.  
DOCTOR: I very much doubt it. You see, before you reactivated it, I reversed
the polarity of the neutron flow.  
MASTER: You did what? You realise what will happen?  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Do you?  
MASTER: Well, there'll be a massive reverse feedback into their whole power
system.  
DOCTOR: Exactly. In about ten minutes from now the whole place should go up.
Enjoy your revenge.  
(The Master goes to the small porthole and shouts out.)  
MASTER: Guards! Guards, come back! You must release me! I must talk to your
chief! Let me out! We're all in danger! Let me out!  
DOCTOR: You're wasting your time, you know. Even if they heard you, they
couldn't do anything about it.  
MASTER: Why?  
DOCTOR: Well, I built a self-destruct mechanism into the main control switch.
You can't turn it off.  
MASTER: But but we'll both be killed.  
DOCTOR: That's right. Unless we can both escape.

**[Naval base radio room]**

BOWMAN: Ships moving into position now, sir.  
WALKER: Very well. This time we'll continue the attack until those creatures
are finally destroyed. Now, how about some tea?

**[Sea Devil's base - cell]**

(The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to unlock the cell.)  
DOCTOR: You see? Come on.

**[Sea Devil's base - detention area]**

DOCTOR: Well, just as I told you. Submarine escape equipment. Now, all we've
got to do is find the airlock.  
MASTER: Airlock?  
DOCTOR: Yes, there must be one around here somewhere. Otherwise how else did
we get down in those capsules? Here you are. Put this on.

**[Hart's office]**

(Blythe enters with Walker's lunch on a heavy tray.)  
WALKER: Ah, thank you, my dear. Ah ha! Smoked salmon. Delicious.

**[Naval base radio room]**

HART: Won't be long now.  
JO: Suppose the Doctor manages to escape from that place?  
HART: Not much chance, I'm afraid.  
JO: Yes, but just suppose?  
HART: Get a high speed hovercraft over that area. I want a complete sweep
before the attack.  
BOWMAN: Aye, aye, sir.

**[Hovercraft]**

(Two figures in orange survival suits are bobbing up and down in the sea,
waving. The crew of XT492 pull the Master aboard.)  
SERGEANT: All right?  
MASTER: All right.  
(Then it is the Doctor's turn.)

**[Sea Devil's base]**

(The power in the trigger mechanism builds towards maximum.)  
SEA DEVIL: This device is causing the power to overload.  
(He switches it off, and there is a little bang.)

**[Hovercraft]**

(Safely inside the craft, the Master clutches his chest and falls to the
floor. Then something under the sea goes KaBOOM several times.)

**[Naval base radio room]**

BOWMAN: Large underwater explosion reported, sir.  
WALKER: What? Has the attack started already?  
BOWMAN: No, sir, before the attack. And they've picked up two survivors. One
of them was in a bad way. They've radioed for an ambulance to stand by.  
JO: Did they, did they say who?  
BOWMAN: No, Miss.

**[Beach]**

(SRN5 lands as Jo and a pair of stretcher bearers run down the shingle. The
Doctor goes to meet Jo and Hart.)  
JO: They said someone was hurt?  
DOCTOR: It's the Master. He collapsed soon after they picked us up.  
HART: Well then, Doctor, what happened?  
DOCTOR: I managed to destroy their base for you.  
HART: Thank goodness. Well done.  
DOCTOR: Well, I did what I had to to prevent a war.  
(The stretcher party come back with the Master.)  
JO: He's dead.  
MEDIC: We were too late. The doctor in the hovercraft said so.  
DOCTOR: Doctor? What doctor?  
(The Doctor removes a latex mask from the man on the stretcher.)  
SAILOR: I must obey. I must obey. I must obey. I must obey. I must obey. I
must obey.  
(The Master flies the hovercraft back out to sea.)  
SAILOR: I must obey. I must obey.
