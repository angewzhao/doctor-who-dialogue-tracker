Original Airdate: 30 Jan, 1971  

__**Episode One**__

**[Prison]**

(The Doctor and Jo drive up to the Constable's Gateway entrance to Dover
Castle, currently masquerading as HM Prison Stangmoor, and parks on the
drawbridge.)  
JO: It looks like Dracula's castle.  
DOCTOR: Well, you're right about the castle bit. It used to be a fortress in
the Middle Ages.  
JO: Doctor? You'll need this.  
(Jo gives him an ID pass.)  
DOCTOR: Thanks, Jo.  
(The Doctor rings the entrance bell.)  
DOCTOR: Smile, Jo.  
JO: What?  
DOCTOR: You're on camera.  
(The Doctor waves at the CCTV, and the personnel in the security room stare at
the crazy man on the monitor. A prison officer comes out.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, good morning. Er, observers from UNIT. My admission pass.  
OFFICER: (into R/T) Right. Passes checked and satisfactory. Right, open the
gates.  
(The Doctor gets back into Bessie.)  
DOCTOR: Abandon hope all ye who enter here.  
(They drive through the gates into a courtyard.)

**[Prison cell block]**

(The prisoners are restless, and making lots of noise in their cells which
masks some dialogue. A central staircase leads up to a catwalk. By a glass
brick wall is a door labelled Process Theatre.)  
POWERS: Green! Calm the men down. The Governor's on his way.  
(Green goes up the stairs.)  
GOVERNOR: Morning, Chief. Everything all right?  
POWERS: Will be, sir.  
GOVERNOR: Good, good. Well, let's see to it.  
OFFICER [OC]: Keep that noise down!

**[Cell block landing]**

(The Governor, Powers, Kettering and Summers, in a white lab coat, go up the
stairs and are let through a gate to another corridor leading to steps
downwards.) KETTERING: Why do they always have to make that stupid row?  
SUMMERS: It always happens when sentences are being carried out.

**[Prison cell]**

(Two guards are with the prisoner, who leaps up when the party enters.)  
GOVERNOR: George Patrick Barnham.  
BARNHAM: No, you're not going to take me anywhere!  
GOVERNOR: You have been sentenced by a court of law.  
BARNHAM: Get away from me!  
GOVERNOR: The time has come for that sentence to be carried out.  
BARNHAM: Go on! Get out! All of you!  
SUMMERS: I'll give him something to calm him.  
BARNHAM: You won't give me nothing, mate. Get out, all of you!  
POWERS: Pack it in, Barnham. You're just being stupid.  
BARNHAM: You're not going to get me out there!  
POWERS: Get him!  
(The two guards grab Barnham.)  
GOVERNOR: All right.  
GUARD: You come easy.  
BARNHAM: Take it easy, you'll break me arm.  
(Protesting loudly, Barnham is manhandled up the short staircase.)

**[Process Theatre]**

(It is not just Jo and the Doctor who are gathered to observe something. There
is a whole gaggle of men with clipboards sitting around.)  
GREEN: Sorry about the noise, ladies and gentlemen. Just a temporary
disturbance.  
JO: Temporary disturbance? It sounds like a full-scale riot.  
DOCTOR: Morbid lot of sensation seekers.  
JO: Then why did you insist on coming here?  
DOCTOR: Scientific curiosity, my dear.  
JO: Oh, yes.  
(Everyone sits down.)  
DOCTOR: Something's been worrying me about this Keller process ever since I
first heard of it. Ah, the curtain is about to go up.  
(The Governor, Kettering and Powers enter.)  
POWERS: Keep them quiet.  
GREEN: All right, chief.  
(Green leaves.)  
GOVERNOR: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  
DOCTOR: Good morning.  
GOVERNOR: May I introduce Professor Kettering, who will explain the process
you're about to see demonstrated.  
KETTERING: Well, as you're no doubt aware, we no longer execute our hardened
criminals and killers. Modern society has progressed far beyond that primitive
form of retribution. Today, science  
DOCTOR: (sotto) It all depends what you mean by progress, doesn't it.  
KETTERING: Science has abolished the hangman's noose and substituted this
infallible method. Professor Emil Keller  
DOCTOR: (sotto) People who talk about infallibility are usually on very shaky
ground, I think.  
KETTERING: For the benefit of the less sophisticated members of my audience, I
will explain in very simple terms. Professor Emil Keller, the inventor of this
process, discovered that anti-social behaviour was governed by certain
negative or evil impulses. Now this machine, the Keller machine, extracts
these impulses and leaves a rational, well-balanced individual.  
DOCTOR: It doesn't.  
JO: What?  
KETTERING: May I be permitted to continue?  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes, please do.  
KETTERING: Thank you. The condemned man is placed here (in a chair) after
being tranquillised, with his head under this dome. A series of probes are
attached to his skull so as to connect with the neural circuits. The
extraction process is controlled here. The negative impulses are stored in
that reservoir box there.  
DOCTOR: Where do they go after that?  
KETTERING: Nowhere, sir. I repeat, they are stored in the box.  
DOCTOR: Which is now full of these negative or evil impulses.  
KETTERING: Not full. The indicator registers only sixty five percent at this
time. The machine has been used very successfully in Switzerland. A hundred
and twelve cases have been processed to date and today we shall witness the
one hundred and thirteenth. Thank you, Doctor Summers.  
(Barnham is wheeled in on a gurney, drugged and in an operating gown.)  
SUMMERS: Come on, old chap. Up you get.  
(Barnham is helped into the chair and a metal cap fastened to his head.)  
KETTERING: When the process is completed, the negative impulses that made this
man a criminal will have been removed. He will take his place as a useful, if
lowly, member of society. Are you ready, Doctor Summers?  
SUMMERS: Yes.  
(Kettering adjusts the machine that holds the reservoir box then goes to the
main control panel and flicks switches. He nods to the Governor.)  
GOVERNOR: Let the sentence of the Court been carried out.  
(The lights go down, leaving Barnham in a spotlight. The machine starts
pulsing. Barnham screams.)  
DOCTOR: I knew there was something evil about that machine.  
SUMMERS: Kettering! Look at the dial.  
KETTERING: What of it?  
SUMMERS: It's never registered so high before.  
(Summers checks Barnham for a heart beat.)  
GOVERNOR: Mister Kettering, what's happening?  
(Kettering turns off the machine and the lights come back up.)  
GOVERNOR: Well?  
KETTERING: A minor malfunction. The machine compensated. The process is
completed satisfactorily.  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Satisfactorily be blowed.  
KETTERING: The subject will be taken away to recuperate and within an hour or
two he will be perfectly normal.  
DOCTOR: I admire your confidence, sir.  
KETTERING: Thank you. That is all, gentlemen.  
(As the observers leave, the Doctor goes over to the Governor and Kettering.)  
GOVERNOR: I take it everything was all right, Mister Kettering?  
KETTERING: Yes, of course, Governor.  
DOCTOR: Then would you kindly explain, sir, that unfortunate man's reaction?  
KETTERING: An excess of negative particles. The machine overreacted.  
DOCTOR: In other words, you don't know.  
KETTERING: May I ask who you are, sir?  
GOVERNOR: The Doctor is Scientific Advisor to UNIT, Mister Kettering.  
KETTERING: UNIT?  
GOVERNOR: United Nations Intelligence Taskforce.  
KETTERING: How interesting, though I fail to see what concern it is  
DOCTOR: UNIT, sir, was set up to deal with new and unusual menaces to mankind.
And in my view, this machine of yours is just that. Jo.

**[Prison Medical ward]**

(Barnham is alive but unconscious.)  
SUMMERS: Right.  
(Kettering enters.)  
KETTERING: Well?  
SUMMERS: Nothing much wrong physically. Respiration normal, pulse rate's a
little high but that's usual after the process.  
KETTERING: Ah, exactly. A completely successful treatment.  
SUMMERS: The reaction was unusually violent.  
KETTERING: Really, my dear Summers, you're as bad as that interfering fool
from UNIT.  
(A telephone rings.)  
SUMMERS: Excuse me.

**[Medical office]**

SUMMERS: Medical wing. Yes? What? Have you told the Governor? I'll be right
over.

**[Prison Medical ward]**

SUMMERS: (to orderly) Come with me. (to another) You stay with the patient.  
KETTERING: Anything the matter?  
SUMMERS: There's been some kind of an accident in the process room. They think
the man's dead.

**[Process Theatre]**

(A young man is lying on the floor. Green checks his wallet as Summers and the
orderlies enter.)  
SUMMERS: What happened?  
GREEN: I don't know, sir.  
GOVERNOR: What happened?  
GREEN: I don't know, sir. I was coming along the corridor and I heard him
screaming.  
DOCTOR: Is he dead?  
SUMMERS: Yes, he's dead.  
KETTERING: Probably a heart attack. Delayed shock from seeing the process.  
DOCTOR: Perhaps, but I doubt it. Might I suggest an immediate investigation
into his past medical history and a post mortem.  
SUMMERS: Yes. Yes, a good idea. I'll see to it right away. Get a stretcher,
will you?  
(Summers leaves.)  
JO: Doctor? Did you see his face? He looks terrified. And those marks, like  
DOCTOR: Bites and scratches? Yes, I know.  
JO: Look, I think we'd better get on to the Brigadier.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I agree, Jo, but not just yet. Now, let me get that post mortem
first. It'll give me more to go on.  
JO: All right. Anyway, I don't think he'd thank us for disturbing him right
now.  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
JO: He did tell you all about it, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: All about what?  
JO: Today's the first ever World Peace Conference. UNIT's handling all the
security arrangements.

**[Brigadier's office]**

(This time he has managed to requisition a very posh room with big double
doors, fancy fireplace and large potted ficus.)  
BRIGADIER: (on phone) Yes, that's all very well, sir, but in my opinion.  
(Yates enters.)  
BRIGADIER: Yes, I see, sir. Of course, sir. I take it that is your final
decision? Very well, sir, goodbye.  
YATES: Trouble, sir?  
BRIGADIER: That was the Ministry. UNIT'll be responsible for the safe
transport of the missile. It's been cleared with Geneva.  
YATES: Well, that's all we needed. What with the peace conference on our hands
as well.  
BRIGADIER: Yes. I want you to take charge of this escort detail, Captain
Yates. I've got quite enough on my plate as it is.  
YATES: I'll get onto it right away.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, is the Doctor back from Stangmoor yet?  
YATES: No sir. Er, what exactly is he doing down there?  
BRIGADIER: Observing new development in the treatment of criminals, I believe.
Oh well, I suppose it'll keep him out of mischief. By the way, how are things
at the conference?  
YATES: Oh, all running smoothly, sir.  
BRIGADIER: I only hope it lasts.  
(A Chinese woman officer bursts in, followed by a female UNIT officer - Bell.)  
BRIGADIER: All right, Corporal Bell. Yes, Captain Chin Lee, what can I do for
you?  
CHIN LEE: Brigadier, an outrage has been committed against the Chinese
people's delegation. As you are in charge of security arrangements, we hold
you directly responsible.  
BRIGADIER: What is it now, Captain?  
CHIN LEE: Important state documents have been stolen from General Cheng Teik's
suite.  
YATES: That's impossible. There's a twenty four hour guard on all the
delegate's suites.  
CHIN LEE: Nevertheless, the theft has occurred. Your guards are inefficient.
Perhaps they take bribes?  
BRIGADIER: That is an insulting suggestion, Captain. I will not tolerate any!
Very well, Captain, I'll investigate the matter immediately.  
CHIN LEE: I must warn you that this puts the success of the peace conference
in grave jeopardy. We suspect the imperialist Americans of this crime.  
BRIGADIER: Naturally. I assure you that every effort will be made to locate
the missing papers and to punish whoever is responsible.  
CHIN LEE: Any further trouble and our delegation will withdraw from this
conference.  
(Chin Lee leaves.)  
BRIGADIER: More trouble.  
YATES: Mmm, pity. She's quite a dolly.  
(Chin Lee leaves 24 Cornwall Gardens and walks straight past the limousine
waiting for her. She goes to the Green in middle of the area and takes a
document from her jacket. She removes it's ribbon and sets fire to it then
drops it into a waste paper basket at the last moment. Then she flinches and
touches a round metal device just behind her right ear before leaving the
scene.)

**[Process Theatre]**

DOCTOR: And you are still convinced this Keller process is working normally?  
KETTERING: Yes, of course it is. I mean, you've just seen Barnham.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I've seen him.  
KETTERING: Look, Emil Keller himself installed it here. I worked closely with
him. I know every facet of the process.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. But I still don't like it.  
GOVERNOR: What?  
DOCTOR: Interfering with the mind, Governor. It's a dangerous business.  
KETTERING: Well, it's hardly your concern, is it?  
DOCTOR: Professor Kettering, it is everyone's concern!  
SUMMERS [OC]: After you.  
(Jo and Summers enter.)  
GOVERNOR: Ah, Doctor Summers. Any news for us?  
SUMMERS: I've got the post mortem report.  
KETTERING:: Well?  
SUMMERS: The deceased's name was Arthur Linwood, a medical student in his
final year.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, but what did he die of?  
SUMMERS: Heart failure.  
KETTERING: Watching the process was too much for him.  
SUMMERS: But he didn't have a weak heart, Mister Kettering.  
DOCTOR: Anything in his medical history?  
SUMMERS: Yes, I called his hospital. He suffered from a fear of certain
animals.  
DOCTOR: Oh, which ones?  
SUMMERS: Well, apparently, in the laboratory he was absolutely terrified of  
DOCTOR: Rats?  
SUMMERS: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Tell me, these marks on his face on his face and neck, these bites and
scratches, could they have been caused by rats?  
SUMMERS: Certainly they could, yes.  
GOVERNOR: But there are no rats in this room. There's none in the entire
prison.  
SUMMERS: Yet all the indications are that he was attacked by a hoard of them,
and the shock killed him.  
KETTERING: You must be mistaken.  
DOCTOR: But Linwood is dead.  
KETTERING: Because of heart failure!  
DOCTOR: No, Professor Kettering, because of this machine.  
KETTERING: I tell you that man's death had nothing to do with this machine,
and if you were a scientist you'd understand.  
DOCTOR: If I were a scientist? Let me tell you, sir, that I am a scientist,
and I have been for several thousand. Jo.  
(The Doctor leaves.)  
KETTERING: The man's mad.  
JO: On the contrary, sir, he happens to be a genius. I do wish you'd listen to
him.  
(Jo leaves.)  
SUMMERS: Victor?  
GOVERNOR: I think you'd better give this machine a thorough check, Professor
Kettering.  
KETTERING: Yes, of course, Governor. But I assure you there's no reason for
anxiety.  
GOVERNOR: All the same, better safe than sorry?

**[UNIT office]**

(Yates and Bell are both on telephone when the Brigadier enters.)  
YATES: I'll give you the final security schedules just as soon as I've had a
chance to clear them with the Brigadier.  
BELL: A call for you on line one, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, put it through, will you?  
YATES: Right, right, I'll ring you back within twenty minutes.  
(Another telephone rings.)  
BELL: UNIT HQ? Oh, good morning, sir.

**[Brigadier's office]**

BELL [OC]: Yes, certainly Captain, I'm just  
BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart? I see. You're sure? Very well, continue the
search. (into intercom) Captain Yates, will you come in for a moment please?  
(Yates enters.)  
BRIGADIER: Oh, sit down. Well, there's no trace of Chin Lee's missing papers.
Our people have turned the place inside out. It wouldn't surprise me if she
lost them herself.  
BELL: Excuse me, sir. Captain Chin Lee on the phone. Do you want to speak to
her?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, I'll speak to her.  
BELL: Hotline, sir.  
BRIGADIER: I wonder what she's complaining of this time? Yes, good afternoon,
Captain Chin Lee. What can I do for you? Yes, I see. No, don't touch anything.
I'll be over at once.  
YATES: More stolen papers, sir?  
BRIGADIER: (into intercom.) Get my car ready at once.  
BELL [OC]: Right, sir.  
BRIGADIER: We've got real trouble this time. The Chinese delegate's dead.  
(In the Process Theatre, the reservoir dial flickers as Kettering takes a
panel off the control console. Then he puts his hands to his head as the
machine starts to hum.)

**[Prison cell block]**

OFFICER: All right men, keep that noise down.  
POWERS: Starting up again, are they?  
GREEN: Just like before. I don't what it is.

**[Process Theatre]**

(The machine is humming loudly as Kettering 'sees' a vast expanse of open
water. He moves his arms as if swimming.)  
KETTERING: No, no.  
(Then he raises his arms above his head as he sinks to the floor. The machine
shuts itself off. Later, he is lying on a stretcher. Summers puts the blanket
over Kettering's face and orderlies carry him away.)  
GOVERNOR: Dead. Do you know how it happened, Roland?  
SUMMERS: I'm not sure. It's incredible, really.  
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, man, come on.  
SUMMERS: From the position of the body, tinge of the skin  
DOCTOR: Well?  
SUMMERS: All the symptoms are consistent with death by drowning.  
GOVERNOR: But that's ridiculous!  
DOCTOR: Like the rats?  
SUMMERS: Shall I go and check on his medical record?  
DOCTOR: Yes, a good idea. How long would you say he'd been dead?  
SUMMERS: Oh, a matter of minutes, five at the outside.  
(Summers leaves.)  
JO: That must have been about the time the riot started.  
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly.  
GOVERNOR: Are you suggesting there's some connection?  
DOCTOR: This machine has the power to affect men's minds, Governor, and it's
growing stronger.  
GOVERNOR: Oh, come now, Doctor. It's only a machine.  
DOCTOR: Yes, maybe, but nevertheless it's dangerous and it should be destroyed
now!  
GOVERNOR: Well, I've no authority to do that. I'll report your recommendations
to the Home Office but they'll have to decide.  
DOCTOR: I wonder how many deaths it'll take to convince them?

**[Chinese Delegation suite]**

(Another body is covered over. Photographs are being taken of the mess caused
by an apparent struggle.)  
CHIN LEE: First theft, Brigadier, now murder. What are you going to do about
it?  
BRIGADIER: Who else knows about this?  
CHIN LEE: No one. I called you at once.  
YATES: Shall I call the police. sir?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, just a courtesy call, but tell them we'll handle this
ourselves. And I want a full check on all movements in and out of this suite
before Cheng Teik's death. And no press. 'D' notice.  
YATES: Right, sir.  
BRIGADIER: And get the Doctor back from Stangmoor, will you? I want him here.  
YATES: Yes, sir.  
(Yates leaves.)  
BRIGADIER: Now then, Captain. I'd like you to tell me exactly what happened,
please? In detail.  
CHIN LEE: My appointment with the General was for twelve pm. There were some
details to discuss about the conference.  
BRIGADIER: And you were punctual?  
CHIN LEE: I am always punctual. I showed my pass to your UNIT sentry and
entered as the clock was striking twelve.  
BRIGADIER: Go on.  
CHIN LEE: There is nothing more to tell. I saw the General's body and phoned
you.  
BRIGADIER: Immediately?  
CHIN LEE: Of course.  
BRIGADIER: Excuse me a moment, will you? Oh, Corporal Bell? I'd like you to.  
(The Brigadier looks at Chin Lee, who moves away a little.)  
BRIGADIER: (sotto) I want you to make an exact check on the time of Chin Lee's
phone call.  
BELL: Right, sir.

**[Process Theatre]**

GOVERNOR: I'm sorry, Doctor. That's my final word. I'll suspend further use of
the Keller process, I'll put this room out of bounds. But that's all I can do
without higher authority.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, all right. Well, I'd better make this machine safe.  
JO: Can I help?  
DOCTOR: On my own.  
GOVERNOR: Is that wise?  
DOCTOR: Perhaps not.  
JO: Well then  
DOCTOR: But I prefer to work that way. Tell me, how long has this machine been
installed?  
GOVERNOR: Nearly a year. Emil Keller came over from Switzerland to supervise
the installation.  
DOCTOR: I see. Did he have an assistant?  
GOVERNOR: Mmm hmm. A rather attractive Chinese girl.

**[Chinese Delegation suite]**

BELL: (into phone) Yes. Mmm. Yes, right. Thank you.  
(Bell gives the Brigadier a note.)  
BRIGADIER: Thank you. You telephoned me immediately?  
CHIN LEE: Yes.  
BRIGADIER: No, Captain, you didn't. You telephoned me at exactly twelve twenty
four.  
CHIN LEE: You must be mistaken.  
BRIGADIER: You called me on a security line. All security calls are logged.
Well, Captain? Why did you wait for nearly half an hour before reporting the
crime?

**[Prison Medical ward]**

(Barnham wakes, and the orderly fetches Summers from the little office.)  
SUMMERS: How do you feel?  
BARNHAM: Fine. Fine. Have I been ill?  
SUMMERS: Yes, but you're all right now.  
BARNHAM: Are you a doctor?  
SUMMERS: Mmm hmm. Don't you remember? I'm Doctor Summers. Just try and rest.
You'll be all right.  
BARNHAM: Anything you say, Doctor.  
SUMMERS: Well, he seems fully recovered, physically.  
JO: And mentally?  
SUMMERS: Well, his memory's a bit hazy but it's only to be expected.  
JO: And has the process harmed him?  
SUMMERS: I, I don't know, Miss Grant.  
JO: The Doctor was wondering about Mister Kettering's medical history?  
SUMMERS: Oh, yes, I've got the post mortem report through there.  
JO: What's the verdict?  
SUMMERS: Kettering's lungs were full of water. He drowned in the middle of a
perfectly dry room.

**[Process Theatre]**

(The prisoners start up their noise again outside, drowning out the prison
officer's dialogue as they rush up the stairs to try and quieten them down,
and the Doctor sees the Keller machine begin to pulse. In pain, he starts to
pull wires from the control panel but it makes no difference. Flames appear in
front of the Doctor's eyes.)

__**Episode Two**__

**[Process Theatre]**

(The Doctor tries to shield himself from the flames as Jo enters.)  
JO: Doctor? What's the matter? Let's sit down. It's all right, there's nothing
there.  
(The machine has stopped but the Doctor is still gibbering with fear.)  
JO: There's nothing there. Come and sit. There's nothing, Doctor. It's me, Jo.
It's all right.  
DOCTOR: Jo. Jo, what are you doing here?  
JO: Well, you wanted this report on Kettering. I got it from Doctor Summers.  
DOCTOR: Look, I told you to take that directly to the Governor's office.  
JO: I thought it was important.  
DOCTOR: So are my instructions, Jo. So are my instructions. You might have
been killed.  
JO: Me killed? It seemed that you were the one in danger. You looked as if you
were fighting something that wasn't there.  
DOCTOR: Well, it was there, Jo. At least it was until you distracted it. Your
coming in broke its grip on my mind. Let me see that report.  
JO: You were right about Kettering. He did have a morbid fear of water.  
DOCTOR: So he drowned in a perfectly dry room.  
JO: Doctor, what did you see?  
DOCTOR: Fire.  
JO: But why should you?  
DOCTOR: Well, some time ago, Jo, I witnessed a terrible catastrophe. A whole
world just, just disappeared in flames. Well, this machine picked that memory
out of my mind and used it to attack me.  
JO: This fire you saw, it wasn't real.  
DOCTOR: Neither was the water, nor the rats, yet Linwood is dead and so is
Professor Kettering. We believe what our minds tell us to, Jo.  
JO: If this machine's so dangerous, why not just blow it up? Destroy it.  
DOCTOR: Because those idiots in authority won't let me, that's why. I'm trying
to find a way of controlling it. So, if you've quite finished asking
questions?  
JO: All right, I'm going.  
(Yates enters.)  
JO: Mike? What are you doing here?  
YATES: The Brigadier's orders. I'm afraid, Doctor, you've got to come back to
London with me.  
DOCTOR: Nonsense. I can't possibly leave Stangmoor.  
YATES: You've got to, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: I'm telling you I'm not leaving.  
YATES: I'm sorry, Doctor. You're coming back with me, even if I have to use
force.  
(Yates takes hold of the Doctor's arm and receives a forefinger below the
collar bone for his trouble. He can't move.)  
DOCTOR: Venusian Karate. I think you'll find that a lot harder than you
imagine, young man.  
(The Doctor lets Yates go.)  
YATES: Look, Doctor, he really does need you. Things are going very badly at
the peace conference. The Chinese delegate's dead and we think he's been
murdered.  
DOCTOR: Murdered? Yes, all right, Captain Yates. I'll come with you.  
YATES: Thank you.  
JO: Doctor? I'll say here and look after things for you.  
DOCTOR: Look, Jo, for once in your young life, do you think you could do
exactly as I ask?  
JO: Yes, of course.  
DOCTOR: Now go and see the Governor. Tell him to lock and bar that door. No
one is to enter this room. No one. Do you understand?  
JO: Just leave everything to me.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm rather afraid I'll have to. Try and keep out of trouble,
will you?  
JO: Yes, Doctor.  
(The Doctor leaves, but Jo is holding his clock.)  
DOCTOR: Come along, Captain Yates, what are you waiting for?  
JO: Doctor! Mike.

**[Cornwall Gardens]**

(Chin Lee is in a telephone box as Benton, dressed in civvies, is keeping an
eye on her. She steps out of the box and stares at Benton, who staggers
against a railing, clutching his head in pain. We are given an image of the
Keller machine pulsing away. As Benton collapses, a man rushes over to help
him. Chin Lee leaves.)  
MAN: Are you all right?  
BENTON: Yes. Yes, I'm all right, thank you.  
(Benton starts to run after Chin Lee and falls down before staggering on
again. The machine shuts itself off again. Benton gets to UNIT HQ without
spotting Chin Lee hiding behind a workman's tent.)

**[Brigadier's office]**

BRIGADIER: You lost her?  
BENTON: Yes, sir. She gave me the slip. One minute I had her well in sight and
next she just  
BRIGADIER: She vanished in a puff of smoke.  
BENTON: No, sir. I got this sort of throbbing in my head. I guess I fainted.
When I came to, she'd gone.  
BRIGADIER: Throbbing in the head? Fainting? You're too delicate for
intelligence work, Benton. You'd better go and lie down.  
BENTON: Right, sir. Sorry, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Dismissed, Sergeant. Just get out of my sight.  
(The Doctor and Yates enter as Benton leaves.)  
DOCTOR: I see you're in your usual sweet affable mood, Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER: When you've quite finished grinning like a Cheshire cat, Captain
Yates!  
YATES: Sir.  
(Yates leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Right, now, Brigadier, would you kindly tell me what all this fuss is
about?  
(Benton leaves the building, and we are treated to a view of a telephone
engineer working in a junction box. He switches on a hand-held device then
packs up and goes back to the tent where he turns it on again.)

**[UNIT office]**

(Yates is on the telephone. He takes it from his ear then tries again.)  
YATES: Mister Curry, are you still there? Oh good. No, no, for a moment I
thought we'd been cut off.

**[Workman's tent]**

YATES [OC]: As I was saying, the escort will be under my command and will
consist of myself, a Sergeant and four motorcycle outriders.  
(The engineer removes his mask and overalls. It is the Master.)  
CURRY [OC]: It's a bit light, isn't it, Captain, considering the importance of
this weapon.  
YATES [OC]: We'll only make ourselves conspicuous if we surround it with a
small army, won't we?  
CURRY [OC]: Oh, all right. I suppose you people know best.  
YATES [OC]: Our ETA with you will be at oh eight fifteen hours.  
CURRY [OC]: And you will let me know the route?  
YATES [OC]: Yes, I'll ring you through with the route as soon as it's
finalised. Goodbye, sir.  
CURRY [OC]: Goodbye.  
(The Master turns off the radio, picks up his coat and briefcase, and walks
across the square to a chauffeur driven car. Once settled inside he switches
on the radio again.)

**[Brigadier's office]**

BRIGADIER: All right, all right, all right, all right, Doctor! You win.  
DOCTOR: And you'll back up my report to the Home Office calling for a complete
ban on the Keller process.  
BRIGADIER: Yes.  
DOCTOR: And you'll get in touch with the Home Secretary and make sure that he
takes some action.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor, and if that doesn't do any good, I personally will go
down to Stangmoor and blow the blasted machine up myself. Now, are you or are
you not going to help me with this case?  
DOCTOR: My dear Lethbridge Stewart, your word is my command. You know that you
only have to ask.  
BRIGADIER: Thank you.  
(The Brigadier gets his briefcase.)  
DOCTOR: Well, where on earth do you think you're going?  
BRIGADIER: We are going to see the new Chinese delegate, Mister Fu Peng.  
DOCTOR: Fu Peng? He must be Hokien.  
BRIGADIER: No, no, no, Doctor. He's Chinese. Now, come along.

**[UNIT office]**

YATES: Excuse me.  
BRIGADIER: Later!  
(The Brigadier leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, it's going to be one of those days. Cheshire cat, Captain Yates,
Cheshire cat.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm coming.  
YATES: (into phone) Get me transport, will you?

**[Master's car]**

TRANSPORT [OC]: Transport?  
YATES [OC]: Captain Yates here. I'd like you to lay on a motorcycle escort of
four and a jeep for oh seven hundred hours tomorrow.  
TRANSPORT [OC]: Right-o, sir. Where's your rendezvous, sir?  
(The Master watches the Doctor and Brigadier walk along Cornwall Gardens.)  
YATES [OC]: Here at HQ. I'll take the party down myself.  
TRANSPORT [OC]: Right-o, sir.

**[Chinese Delegation]**

(Fu Peng is reading a newspaper when the Brigadier and Doctor are shown in. He
ignores them.)  
BRIGADIER: Oh, Mister Fu Peng? I'm Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart of UNIT
command. I'm in charge of all security arrangements. And this is our
scientific advisor.  
DOCTOR: (in Hokien) This unworthy person welcomes you and delights in your
safe arrival.  
(Fu Peng stands and replies in the same language.)  
FU PENG: Thank you for your courtesy and welcome. It is I who am delighted to
meet such a charming person in this barbaric country. (in English) It is rare
to meet a westerner who knows my language.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Actually I fear my Hokien is somewhat rusty.  
FU PENG: On the contrary, it is excellent.  
DOCTOR: Well, it's many years since I've had a chance to use it.  
(The aide brings a chair for the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: I remember once having a conversation with Tse-Tung.  
FU PENG: Tse-Tung? But that is the personal name of our chairman, Mao Tse-
Tung.  
DOCTOR: He himself gave me leave to use it.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, if we could just discuss the immediate problem.  
FU PENG: You will take some tea?  
DOCTOR: Kam si ya.  
FU PENG: Tang pei lai. Sing- sen.  
(Chatting happily in Hokien, Fu Peng and the Doctor go into an inner room,
leaving the Brigadier to sit alone on the empty chair.)

**[Prison cell block]**

(A prisoner is being taken from his cell.)  
OFFICER: Come on, Mailer, out you come. Get behind me there.  
(Another prisoner with a mop and box of cleaning items is let through the
grill to the side corridor and Barnham's old cell.)  
GREEN: Right, Vosper, come on.

**[Prison cell]**

GREEN: Right, Vosper, get busy. I want this place cleaned up properly.

**[Prison Medical ward]**

(Barnham is listening to the radio on headphones as the Keller machine starts
up again.)  
SUMMERS: Hello.  
JO: How is he?  
SUMMERS: Fit as a fiddle, aren't you, Barnham? Barnham.  
(Barnham takes off the headphones.)  
SUMMERS: Visitor for you. Pull up a chair.  
(Jo sits and hands Barnham a pack of Dairy Box.)  
JO: Hello.  
BARNHAM: Thank you. Do I know you?  
JO: Well, we've sort of met.  
BARNHAM: It's just that I can't seem to remember anybody or anything very
well.  
JO: Don't you remember being treated by the Keller machine?  
BARNHAM: It's all a bit of a blank, I'm afraid. Do you know, you wouldn't
believe this, but I couldn't even remember me own name. Not until the Doctor
there told me.  
JO: Well, I'm glad to see you looking so much better. Bye.  
BARNHAM: Thanks very much for the chocolates, Miss.

**[Medical office]**

JO: Well, everything seems all right.  
SUMMERS: I'm not sure. I still think that in Barnham's case the machine has
overreacted. It's extracted all the negative impulses from his brain.  
JO: So what does that make him now?  
SUMMERS: It depends how you look at it. An idiot, or a saint.

**[Prison cell]**

(The prisoners are revolting. Again.)  
VOSPER: Getting a bit noisy, ain't they, Mister Green?  
(Green leaves.)  
GREEN [OC]: Right, let's keep those prisoners quiet. All of you! Keep quiet.  
(Vosper rummages in the cleaning box, gets out a hand gun and hides it under
the bunk pillows. Green returns.)

**[Prison cell block]**

(Another prisoner is under heavy escort and the Governor is with them.)  
POWERS: All right! Keep that noise down!  
OFFICER: All right, you heard the Governor. Keep the noise down! Okay, Mailer.

**[Prison cell]**

POWERS: Come on, Vosper, outside.  
(Vosper packs up and leaves.)  
MAILER: Proper little home from home, ain't it?  
GOVERNOR: You'll be in this cell until sentence is carried out, Mailer.  
MAILER: Oh, don't put any money on it, Governor. No one's turning me into a
zombie and that includes you, mate.  
POWERS: That's enough of that, Mailer.  
(Mailer lies on the bed and snores.)  
GOVERNOR: All right, Chief.  
(The Governor leaves.)  
POWERS: Watch him.  
OFFICER: Yes sir. (Powers leaves two officers to watch the condemned man. One
picks up the draughts board.)  
OFFICER: Fancy a game then, Harry? Pass the time?  
MAILER: Drop dead.  
OFFICER: Suit yourself. Come on, let's have a game. Right, you're black.  
(Mailer feels underneath the pillows.)  
OFFICER 2: Cup of tea?  
OFFICER: No, I'm all right.

**[Chinese Delegation]**

(A tea ceremony comes to a close. The Doctor and Fu Peng are still speaking
Hokien.)  
DOCTOR: Wa hi, Peng-san. I should be delighted to dine with you soon.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, there are a few questions that I should like to ask,
Mister Fu Peng.  
(Fu Peng goes back to Hokien.)  
BRIGADIER: What did he say?  
DOCTOR: Dried squid and stewed jellyfish, my dear fellow. For our dinner. Beng
ahn, my dear Peng-san.  
FU PENG: Cheng lu. Till our next meeting then, my dear Sing-sen.  
BRIGADIER: I really must insist on asking  
DOCTOR: Come along, my dear fellow. We've got a great deal of work to do, you
know.  
(The Doctor leaves.)  
BRIGADIER: Could you perhaps?  
(The Brigadier gives up and leaves.)

**[Prison cell]**

MAILER: Well, where's this grub then? You planning to starve me to death?  
OFFICER: It's coming, Mailer, it's coming.  
MAILER: Yeah, so is Christmas.  
(A prison officer enters with a tray. Mailer grabs him from behind and points
the gun at his neck.)  
MAILER: Right! Easy! Keys. Come on. Now move it!

**[Brigadier's office]**

BRIGADIER: Are you're seriously suggesting there's a connection?  
DOCTOR: Another mysterious death with unexplained marks on the face and body?
There's got to be.  
BRIGADIER: But this Keller machine of yours is miles away.  
(Yates enters.)  
YATES: Excuse me, sir. We're about ready for off, sir, if you'll just okay the
movement order and route plans.  
DOCTOR: Off for another little trip, Captain Yates?  
YATES: Not exactly, Doctor. We're moving the Thunderbolt.  
DOCTOR: The what?  
YATES: The Thunderbolt. It's a nuclear powered missile with a warhead full of
nerve gas.  
DOCTOR: I thought they'd outlawed those things?  
BRIGADIER: Oh yes, they have. This one's on its way to the naval dockyard.
They're going to dump it at the bottom of the ocean.  
DOCTOR: With the peace conference going on it's not the most tactful time to
be trundling rockets about, is it?  
BRIGADIER: I see you're taking Benton.  
YATES: If it's okay with you, sir?  
BRIGADIER: Oh, you're welcome to him. Just make sure he doesn't lose the
missile for you.  
YATES: Sir?  
BRIGADIER: Well, he somehow managed to lose a Chinese girl in broad daylight.  
DOCTOR: Chinese girl? What Chinese girl?  
BRIGADIER: All right, Yates, carry on. Good luck.  
YATES: Oh, thank you, sir.  
(Yates leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Brigadier, what Chinese girl?!  
BRIGADIER: Well, Captain Chin Lee, the General's aide. I thought she was
implicated so I had her followed. Benton lost her.  
DOCTOR: That's it then. That's the link.  
BRIGADIER: What is?  
DOCTOR: When Emil Keller installed his machine at Stangmoor prison, he had a
Chinese girl with him as an assistant.  
BRIGADIER: It could be coincidence.  
DOCTOR: Coincidence, my foot. You'd better put out a general alert for that
Chinese girl, Brigadier. She's got to be found and quick!

**[Master's car]**

(Outside the UNIT building, Chin Lee walks to the car and the chauffeur opens
the door.)  
MASTER: You're late, Captain.  
CHIN LEE: My apologies, Master.  
(She gets in.)  
MASTER: You did well at the conference. Now I have another little task for
you.  
CHIN LEE: No, no, please, no! Not  
(The Master forces her to look into his eyes.)  
MASTER: You will obey me!  
CHIN LEE: I will obey you, Master.  
MASTER: Tonight, you will kill the American delegate.  
CHIN LEE: Tonight, I will kill the American delegate.  
MASTER: Good. Now you may go.

**[Prison cell block]**

(Vosper has freed other prisoners, and they are taking prison officers
hostage. The alarm bells sound over the dialogue.)  
MAILER: Now just one peep out of you, that's all!  
VOSPER: I've done the phone, Harry.  
MAILER: Good boy.  
VOSPER: But they've got the wing surrounded.  
GREEN: You've got no chance.  
MAILER: Shut up! They won't come in. Not while we've got so many screws here.  
VOSPER: Are you sure?  
MAILER: They can't get in.  
VOSPER: We can't get out!  
MAILER: Oh, we'll get out. Now shut up. Let me think. Here, you, take over.  
(Mailer and Vosper move aside.)  
VOSPER: We can't stay here, Harry. They'll starve us out.  
MAILER: What we want is hostages.  
VOSPER: We've got 'em!  
MAILER: We need more. Now, if we cut around the kitchen, get to the prison
hospital, maybe we can grab a doctor. All right? Now you lot stay here! Come
on.

**[Medical office]**

(Jo tries to make a phone call while Summers locks the drugs cupboard.)  
JO: It's no good. The line's dead.  
SUMMERS: I think you'd better go to the admin block, Miss Grant.  
JO: What about you?  
SUMMERS: I'll stay here. Someone's bound to get hurt by the time they've
finished.  
(Mailer and Vosper enter, with the gun.)  
MAILER: Out. Get him. You're not going to give me any trouble, are you?

**[Brigadier's office]**

(Bell draws the curtain against the night as both the Doctor and Brigadier
make telephone calls.)  
DOCTOR: Look, operator, I've been waiting some considerable time now for my
call to Stangmoor prison.  
BRIGADIER: All right, keep looking. Yes, let me know as soon as you hear
anything.  
DOCTOR: Yes, all right, yes. I'll hang on. There's some trouble there with the
lines.  
BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart? What? No, don't arrest her. I'll deal with this
myself. Message from one of my agents. Chin Lee's turned up again.  
DOCTOR: Chin Lee? Where?  
BRIGADIER: She's just been seen entering the Chinese delegate's suite.

**[Chinese Delegate's suite]**

(Chin Lee makes a phone call.)  
CHIN LEE: Room four hundred and eleven. Hello, is the American delegate there,
please? This is Captain Chin Lee of the Chinese people's delegation. I wish to
speak to Senator Alcott urgently. Yes, thank you.

**[American Delegate's suite]**

(The Senator has been called away from his dinner.)  
ALCOTT: Hello? This is Senator Alcott speaking. Yes, Captain, what can I do
for you?

**[Chinese Delegate's suite]**

CHIN LEE: Comrade Fu Peng wishes to see you immediately and wonders if you
could come to our suite.

**[American Delegate's suite]**

ALCOTT: What, at this time of night?

**[Chinese Delegate's suite]**

CHIN LEE: It is a matter of vital importance. He wishes to assure you that it
is to your country's advantage.

**[American Delegate's suite]**

ALCOTT: But Captain, this is highly irregular.

**[Chinese Delegate's suite]**

CHIN LEE: He asks that you come alone. The subject is most secret.

**[American Delegate's suite]**

ALCOTT: All right, I'll be right over.

**[Chinese Delegate's suite]**

CHIN LEE: Your time will not be wasted, Senator. (She goes to the main door
and removes the security chain, then waits in the shadows. After a few moments
there is knock on the door. Alcott enters.)  
ALCOTT: Hello? Anyone home? Mister Fu Peng?  
(Chin Lee follows Alcott into the main room.)  
ALCOTT: Mister Fu Peng? Oh. May I ask what this is all about, Captain?  
CHIN LEE: Of course.  
ALCOTT: Well, where's Mister Fu Peng?  
CHIN LEE: He will be here soon. Sit down.  
ALCOTT: Now look, Captain, I'm in the middle of my dinner and I  
CHIN LEE: Sit down, please.  
ALCOTT: All right, but make it short, will you?  
(Chin Lee turns off the lights.)  
ALCOTT: What are you doing?  
(Alcott clutches at his head as the Keller machine starts up.)  
ALCOTT: What's this noise? This noise in my head. This terrible sound! This
sound. What's happening?  
(As far as Alcott is concerned, Chin Lee has just become a fearsome Oriental
dragon.)  
ALCOTT: Get back! Get back, I tell you! Get back! Don't come near me!

__**Episode Three**__

**[Chinese Delegate's suite]**

(The Doctor and Brigadier enter, followed by Fu Peng. The Brigadier draws his
revolver, but the Doctor pushes his arm away as he fires.)  
DOCTOR: No, Brigadier!  
(The dragon turns towards them. The Doctor calls to it in Chinese and it turns
back into Chin Lee, who gently collapses.)  
FU PENG: That was one of the legendary monsters of my people.  
DOCTOR: A collective hallucination, gentlemen, nothing more. Who's that?  
BRIGADIER: Senator Alcott. Is he dead?  
DOCTOR: No, but he's suffering from acute shock.  
FU PENG: Sing-sen!  
DOCTOR: Yes?  
FU PENG: What is this?  
(Fu Peng removes the metal disc from behind Chin Lee's ear.)  
DOCTOR: Well, it's a telepathic amplifier.  
BRIGADIER: Is that what caused the hallucinations?  
DOCTOR: No, not caused them. No, it merely picks up the impulses and projects
them through Chin Lee's mind.  
BRIGADIER: Impulses? From where?  
DOCTOR: Well, unless I'm very much mistaken, from the Keller machine at
Stangmoor prison.  
(Which is switching itself off again.)

**[Prison cell block]**

(Jo and Summers are being forced up the stairs.)  
MAILER: Come on! Move it!  
SUMMERS: You'll break my arm!  
VOSPER: Harry! Harry!  
MAILER: Hello?  
VOSPER: The whole wing's surrounded. There's hundreds of them.  
MAILER: So what?  
SUMMERS: Show some sense, Mailer. You'll never get away with it.  
VOSPER: They'll rush us any minute.  
MAILER: Not while we've got these two, will they. Now listen, get back, fix
that phone. I want to talk to the Governor. Down.  
VOSPER: What are you going to do with them?  
MAILER: Put them in the guest room, aren't I. Come on, down.  
(Mailer pushes Jo towards the isolation cell.)

**[Chinese Delegate's suite]**

(Chin Lee is still unconscious. It is just the Doctor and Fu Peng now.)  
FU PENG: Doctor, I've understood very little of what you have been saying.
Please, explain more clearly.  
DOCTOR: Wa ai, Peng-san. Wa ai. Chin Lee was being used by someone who was
trying to drive this world into war.  
FU PENG: You will find this person and punish him?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I will if I can.  
FU PENG: Then I leave matters to you. I must go to my Embassy.  
DOCTOR: Hang ahn, Peng-san.  
FU PENG: Din gon ba bi lu, Sing-sen.  
DOCTOR: May God go with you also.  
(Fu Peng leaves. Chin Lee starts to moan.)  
DOCTOR: Chin Lee? Chin Lee, listen to me. Can you hear me?  
(She mutters.)  
DOCTOR: Cantonese. Noh, hi lay pen lau Chin Lee. Ala mar. Ala mar? You must
trust me.  
CHIN LEE: Something happened. Something terrible!  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, but it was in your mind. It was only in your mind. Now I
want to ask you some questions.  
CHIN LEE: Questions?  
DOCTOR: Yes. About Emil Keller and your visit to Stangmoor prison.

**[Outside the prison cell]**

MAILER: Hello, Len. I thought you'd fixed the phones.  
VOSPER: Sorry, Harry, no luck.  
MAILER: How am I going to make a deal with the Governor if I can't even talk
to him? All right, open this up.  
VOSPER: Yeah.

**[Prison cell]**

VOSPER: All right, you two, on your feet.  
(Summers grabs Vosper's throat.)  
JO: No, don't!  
(Mailer hits Summers with the pistol butt.)  
JO: Don't!  
MAILER: Come on. On your feet. You're getting out of here.  
JO: At last you've seen some sense.  
MAILER: Not you, darling! Now, you're going to take a message to the Governor.  
SUMMERS: What message?  
MAILER: I want safe conduct out of here for me and all the mob in B wing.  
SUMMERS: I'm not leaving here without Miss Grant.  
MAILER: Oh yes you are.  
JO: I'll be all right.  
MAILER: Come on, on your way. Out.  
(Vosper pushes Summers out.)  
MAILER: If you've got any sense, you'll get some beddie-byes. Goodnight.

**[Missile base]**

(Next morning, the Doctor and Chin Lee walk through Cornwall Gardens as the
milk is being delivered. The Master's chauffeur watches them go past then gets
out and crosses to the house opposite. Meanwhile, Benton is haranguing some
hapless squaddies.)  
BENTON: Don't tell me your troubles, mate! I want that missile off the
launching pad and on to the three tonner. Now get that crane in!  
YATES: What's going on, Sergeant? That missile should have been off the pad
ten minutes ago.  
BENTON: I'm sorry sir, but we're having trouble with the crane.  
YATES: No excuses, Sergeant. Just get on with it.  
BENTON: Right sir. Now come on, you men, wake your ideas up!

**[Brigadier's office]**

(The Brigadier is sleeping at his desk. The Doctor draws the heavy curtains to
let sunlight and traffic noise in.)  
DOCTOR: Rise and shine, Brigadier. I've brought Captain Chin Lee here to see
you.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, er, good morning, Captain. Won't you sit down?  
CHIN LEE: Thank you.  
BRIGADIER: (into intercom) Corporal Bell?  
BELL [OC]: Yes, sir?  
BRIGADIER: Lay on some coffee, will you?  
BELL [OC]: Right, sir.  
DOCTOR: Right now, Brigadier. I think you'll find that Captain Chin Lee can
cast considerable light on what's been happening.  
BRIGADIER: Well, I'm glad to hear that someone can.  
(The Brigadier answers his telephone.)  
BRIGADIER: Yes? Oh, morning Yates. Oh. Oh, I see. It's Yates. He's had a hold
up with his, er, cargo.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well tell him to be careful with his, er, cargo.  
BRIGADIER: Sorry, Yates, what was that? Chin Lee? Well

**[Master's car]**

BRIGADIER [OC]: As a matter of fact, there's been some trouble.  
YATES [OC]: What happened, sir?  
BRIGADIER [OC]: As far as I can gather, she tried to scare the American
delegate to death. The Doctor stopped her.  
YATES [OC]: I don't quite follow, sir.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Quite frankly, Yates, neither do I. It's something to do with
the Keller machine at Stangmoor. Anyway, Chin Lee's with me now.  
(The Master switches off his R/T.)  
MASTER: Stangmoor prison.

**[Brigadier's office]**

BRIGADIER: Yes, but where did you first meet this man, Emil Keller?  
CHIN LEE: At an Embassy reception. He told me of the Keller process for
reforming the habitual criminal, and invited me to visit Stangmoor prison with
him.  
BRIGADIER: And you agreed to go?  
CHIN LEE: Prison reform is high on our list of priorities in Peking!  
BRIGADIER: Ah. And can you tell us what happened at Stangmoor?  
CHIN LEE: I know that we went to the process room. I cannot remember.  
BRIGADIER: Well, did you see him again?  
CHIN LEE: Yes, many times, but whenever I think about it, my mind becomes so
confused.  
DOCTOR: Post-hypnotic block. His usual technique.  
BRIGADIER: Whose usual technique?  
DOCTOR: Well, think, man! Who else would make a deliberate attempt to plunge
this world into war, using equipment and techniques not even developed on
Earth, like this.  
BRIGADIER: The Master?  
DOCTOR: Otherwise known as Emil Keller!

**[Prison cell block]**

(Vosper has taken Jo out of the cell.)  
VOSPER: Move.  
OFFICER: Okay! I'm going down the stairs!  
VOSPER: Harry.  
(Mailer pushes Jo against a wall and puts his gun to her throat.)  
MAILER: No trouble.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

SUMMERS: Look Governor, you've got to negotiate.  
GOVERNOR: I'm sorry, Doctor. It's out of the question.  
SUMMERS: But you're risking innocent lives!  
GOVERNOR: Oh look, supposing I do turn Mailer loose and those thugs of his
with him? They'd kill anyone who came in their way. How many innocent lives do
you think I'd be risking then?  
POWERS: I've done everything I can, Doctor. B wing's sealed off. If they get
the slightest chance, my men'll rush the block.  
SUMMERS: And if they don't?  
GOVERNOR: We'll wait it out. Mailer's not stupid. He knows he can't hold out
forever. Once he realises he can't bluff me.  
SUMMERS: But Mailer isn't bluffing! Listen!  
(Summers opens the door to the noise of the riot.)  
POWERS: If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll just  
GOVERNOR: Right, Chief.  
(Powers leaves.)  
SUMMERS: And what about Jo Grant?  
GOVERNOR: Miss Grant is a member of UNIT. She came here on duty.  
SUMMERS: But that makes no difference!  
GOVERNOR: However I will inform her headquarters. Inspector?

**[Brigadier's office]**

(The coffee has arrived and Chin Lee has left.)  
BRIGADIER: Well, Doctor? What am I to do with her?  
DOCTOR: Well, let her go, of course. Well, she's not a criminal. Anyway, she
can't do any more harm now that I've got this.  
(The telephone rings.)  
BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart? Yes, Inspector. What? Yes, I see. There's been
trouble at Stangmoor.  
DOCTOR: Is Jo all right?  
BRIGADIER: Yes? Yes, I see. Thank you for letting me know.  
DOCTOR: Well?  
BRIGADIER: Miss Grant's been captured. She's being held hostage.

**[Prison cell block]**

VOSPER: This is your last chance, Governor. You don't let us go, you're going
to get it!  
MAILER: And that includes the girl. Don't forget that!

**[Prison Governor's office]**

(Powers enters.)  
POWERS: The prisoner's are getting very noisy, sir. Threatening all the
hostages.  
SUMMERS: Victor, you must talk to them.  
GOVERNOR: Aye, you're right. This is a deadlock. Maybe I can make Mailer see
some sense. Come on.

**[Prison cell block]**

MAILER: Going bad enough for you, darling.  
JO: And for you.  
VOSPER: Harry, the Governor's on his way over.  
MAILER: Well, let him in.  
VOSPER: Eh?  
MAILER: Well, I'm not going out there now, am I? Anyway, it's not
(unintelligible).  
VOSPER: Right. Locke, open the door. Let the Governor in. What's the next?
Look!  
MAILER: Barnham!  
VOSPER: He must have come from the hospital.  
BARNHAM: I, I, I'm looking for Doctor Summers. Has anybody seen Doctor
Summers?  
MAILER: Here.  
VOSPER: What?  
MAILER: Get him out of here. He gives me the creeps.  
VOSPER: Right. Come on, mate.  
(While Mailer is looking at Barnham, Jo grabs his hand and the gun goes off as
she gets it out of his grasp. The prison officers turn on their captors. Jo
picks up the gun and runs over to Barnham.)  
JO: Quick! Hide!  
(In the melee, Green punches Mailer who falls at Jo's feet.)  
JO: All right, you, come on. On your feet. Up!  
(Vosper helps Mailer up as Powers and the other officers arrive, followed by
the Governor.)  
JO: Here you are, Governor. He's all yours.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

(The Master's car arrives at the prison.)  
GOVERNOR: Now, look.  
(A knock at the door.)  
GOVERNOR: Yes?  
(Powers enters.)  
POWERS: Professor Keller, sir.  
GOVERNOR: All right, Mister Green.  
GREEN: Sir.  
(The Master enters and Green leaves.)  
GOVERNOR: So, there you are, Professor.  
MASTER: A pleasure to see you again, Governor.  
GOVERNOR: Aye, well to tell the truth, I'm not at all sure I can return the
compliment.  
MASTER: I'm very sorry to hear that. Why?  
POWERS: Shall I?  
MASTER: Oh, thank you.  
(Powers takes the Master's coat.)  
GOVERNOR: Aye, there's been nothing but trouble ever since that machine of
yours was installed.  
MASTER: Well, there are bound to be teething troubles. I can soon take care of
them.  
GOVERNOR: You really think you can get things back to normal.  
MASTER: Yes Governor, I'm sure of it.  
GOVERNOR: Well.  
MASTER: It just needs an adjustment here and there, that's all.  
GOVERNOR: Aye, I hope you can. We've even got UNIT investigating.  
MASTER: UNIT, really.  
GOVERNOR: Yes. Their scientific advisor is on his way down here now.  
MASTER: I don't think we need to trouble him. As a matter of fact, I've
brought my equipment with me.  
GOVERNOR: Well, let me take you to the process theatre.  
MASTER: There is one thing before we go there. I understand that the man who
led the riot was next in line for processing.  
GOVERNOR: That's right. Harry Mailer.  
MASTER: Well first, I'd like to see him, if I may.

**[Prison cell]**

(Powers, the Master and the Governor enter.)  
POWERS: All right, Johnson. Samuels.  
OFFICER: Sir.  
POWERS: We'll be right outside, Mailer, so watch yourself.  
GOVERNOR: Let us know when you've finished, Professor Keller.  
MASTER: Right.  
(The officers, the Governor and Powers leave.)  
MAILER: He said Keller. You're the bloke who invented the machine. Pushing
your luck, ain't you?  
MASTER: Maybe I am.  
MAILER: Now listen.  
(Mailer points a finger at the Master, who grasps his wrist and forces Mailer
to his knees.)  
MASTER: Shut up, Mailer, and keep your voice down. I've come here to help you.  
MAILER: Help me?  
MASTER: You want to get out of here, don't you?  
MAILER: I've tried, mate.  
MASTER: Yes, I heard about that pathetic little attempt. It was bound to fail.
No proper plan and what's more, no resources.  
(The Master opens his briefcase to reveal pistols, small gas grenades and gas
masks.)  
MAILER: What's your game?  
MASTER: You and I, Mailer, are going to create a great deal of havoc in this
place.  
MAILER: Oh yeah? You and me both.  
MASTER: No, not exactly. We have a powerful ally.  
(The Keller machine starts up again, it's reservoir full of dark material.)

**[Prison cell block]**

POWERS: Keep it quiet in here.  
(The officers and the Governor are outside the isolation cell.)  
POWERS: It's starting up again, sir.  
GOVERNOR: They probably think we're going to process Mailer. Stay here, will
you?  
POWERS: Keep it quiet, will you?

**[Prison cell]**

MASTER: Now, you'll find more like these in the boot of my car. Remember, you
are responsible for the main gate. Now, from the outside, I want this prison
to appear to be running quite smoothly. I'm expecting a visitor. All right?
Over there.  
(Gas masks behind their backs, Mailer sits on the table as the Master knocks
on the door. An officer opens the inspection hatch.)  
MASTER: I've finished in here, thank you. Would you open up, please?  
(The Master and Mailer put on the gas masks. They throw the small grenades,
knocking out both officers. The Governor is at the top of the short staircase
and turns to set off the alarm. Mailer shoots him in the back, then two more
officers coming to the locked gate.)

**[Prison Medical ward]**

(A game of cards is in progress.)  
BARNHAM: It's your go.  
(The alarm sounds.)  
JO: Oh no, not again.  
SUMMERS: I'd best see what's happening.  
BARNHAM: Oh, what?  
JO: It's all right, Barnham. Sit down. Everything's okay.

**[Prison cell block]**

(The Master is throwing gas grenades everywhere while Mailer shoots any prison
officer he can see.)  
MASTER: Now listen to me, all of you! Don't try to come out until the gas is
clear. Stay where you are! Get down on the floor!  
(The Master fastens a small device with a flashing light to the side of a
telephone on the wall.)

**[Prison Medical office]**

(A scream of feedback makes Summers drop his telephone.)  
SUMMERS: What the devil was that?  
JO: Look, I think we'd better get out of here.  
(Vosper is there with a gun.)  
VOSPER: There's no escape this time, darling. We've taken over the whole
prison.

**[Prison cell block]**

(The gas is clearing so the Master takes off his mask and switches off the
main alarm. Prisoners are removing the bodies of the guards.)  
MASTER: Right, Doctor. Now I'm ready for you.

**[Prison]**

(The Doctor sounds Bessie's horn several times. Finally a man in guard's cap
and overcoat comes out to him.)  
DOCTOR: Yes?  
MAN: Pass, please.  
DOCTOR: Passes. Television.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

MAN [on monitor]: Pass checked and satisfactory.  
MASTER: Show him in, please.  
MAN [on monitor]: Open the gates. Let him in.

**[Prison]**

(As the Doctor drives in, Mailer runs out in front of him with a shotgun.)  
DOCTOR: Don't point that thing at me, man. It might go off! I'm here on
official business. I understand there's been some trouble here.  
MAILER: That's right, mate, and you're in it. Now, let's get this heap inside.  
DOCTOR: I was going there anyway.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

(The Doctor is escorted in by Vosper and Mailer.)  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I thought as much.  
MASTER: Right, Vosper, Mailer.  
(The criminals leave.)  
MASTER: You don't seem at all surprised.  
DOCTOR: Hardly. How's the riot going?  
MASTER: Oh, long since over. I control the prison now.  
DOCTOR: Do you? And, er, where is Miss Grant to be found?  
MASTER: Reclining in one of our best cells.  
DOCTOR: Is she indeed. Well, let me tell you this, that if you harm so much as
one hair of her head, I'll  
MASTER: You'll do nothing, or I'll put a bullet through both your hearts.  
DOCTOR: Why the delay? I take it that I'm to be killed eventually?  
MASTER: Oh, eventually, yes. But unfortunately, I find I need your help.  
DOCTOR: You want me to help you with that machine of yours. Professor Keller.
You want to be careful of that thing, you know. One day it's going to end up
killing you.  
MASTER: Oh, it won't harm me. I created it.  
DOCTOR: Huh!  
MASTER: But recently I must admit that it has developed a mind of its own.
Hence my need for your assistance while I'm engaged on other business.  
DOCTOR: Oh? What other business?  
MASTER: Your UNIT friends are transporting their nuclear missile. I intend to
take it away from them.

**[Missile Base]**

(Yates is on the telephone.)  
YATES: Yes, sir. We do plan on driving through the night. In that way we
should be back on schedule, according to my estimation, by about midday
tomorrow.

**[Brigadier's office]**

BRIGADIER: All right, Yates, good luck. Keep HQ informed of your movements.
I'll be in contact tomorrow morning.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

DOCTOR: Well, it's a lunatic scheme. Still, that's only to be expected.  
MASTER: Oh, come, Doctor, how can I possibly fail? I launch the missile and
wipe out the peace conference, the world is at war.  
DOCTOR: I see.  
(The Doctor goes to put his glass on the table, and knocks over the jug of
water. Then he overturns the whole desk. The Master tries to get his gun from
the floor but slips on the spilt liquid while the Doctor takes cover behind a
suit of armour. The Master fires but it is only a reflection. The Doctor makes
it across the courtyard to Bessie and further as a prisoner tries to shoot at
him from the ramparts. The Master leaves.)

**[Prison cell]**

JO: I'm sure I heard gunfire.  
SUMMERS: Perhaps there are still some officers holding out.  
JO: Or else the Doctor's come down.

**[Prison cell block]**

(The whole place is empty.)  
DOCTOR: Jo? Jo, where are you?

**[Prison cell]**

JO: Doctor! Doctor, we're in here!  
DOCTOR [OC]: Right, I'm coming!  
(But before the Doctor can get up the stairs, Mailer comes dashing out,
firing. The Doctor goes into

**[Process Theatre]**

MASTER: I thought you'd make for here.  
(Mailer enters.)  
MASTER: Hold it, Mailer! Let me have that gun. I think you'd better show our
patient into the chair, Mailer, and handcuff him into it.  
(The Doctor has no choice but to sit in the treatment chair as Mailer
handcuffs his hands behind his back.)  
DOCTOR: May I ask the purpose of this charade?  
MASTER: Certainly. You'd better wait outside, Mailer.  
(The Master gives Mailer the gun. Mailer leaves.)  
MASTER: As you see, I have affected the necessary repairs. But before I let
you control this machine for me, which I fully intend that you shall, it'll be
very interesting to see exactly how long you can hold out against it. Now
somewhere, you have, er. Ah-ha.  
(The Master finds the telepathy device in the Doctor's pocket.)  
MASTER: Now this little device, as you know, transmits and amplifies the power
of the machine. What you may not know is that it can be adjusted to turn that
power against the wearer, like this.  
(The Master puts the device behind the Doctor's left ear and switches on the
machine.)  
DOCTOR: You know, this is all very tiresome.  
MASTER: Is it? Oh, I really would like to stop and watch your nightmares.  
DOCTOR: Then why don't you?  
MASTER: I have other business as you know. Will you excuse me?  
(The Master leaves the room in semi-darkness and bars the doors on the
outside. The machine cranks itself up to full power and puts images in the
Doctor's mind. First the flames as before, then a familiar voice.)  
DALEK [OC]: Destroy! Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!  
(Various humanoids float across the screen too - all mortal enemies of the
Doctor.)

__**Episode Four**__

**[Process Theatre]**

(All the prisoners are suffering at the 'hands' of the Keller machine. Even
the Master has to fight against its influence as he struggles over to
Processing theatre and unbar the door. The Doctor is slumped in the chair as
the Master manages to get to the control panel and eventually turn it off.
Then the Master goes to the Doctor and removes the amplifying device from
behind his ear, then grabs a handy stethoscope to check for signs of life.
There is just one heartbeat. Mailer crawls in.)  
MAILER: Is he dead?  
MASTER: No, not quite. Wait outside.  
(The Master tries to restart the Doctor's other heart.)

**[Prison cell]**

JO: I know! We can  
(There is a noise outside. Someone looks through the observation hatch.)  
SUMMERS: Get back.  
(Vosper enters, armed.)  
VOSPER: All right, you. You're being transferred.  
SUMMERS: What about Miss Grant?  
VOSPER: Luxury suite, all to herself.  
SUMMERS: Look, if Miss Grant stays, so do I. I  
VOSPER: Charlie, take him.  
SUMMERS: I'm not leaving here without her!  
VOSPER: Take him out.  
(Charlie hustles Summers out.)  
SUMMERS: Why don't you take us both back to the medical wing? At least we
could do some good there!  
JO: What's so special about me?  
VOSPER: We're saving you for the machine, ain't we?

**[Process Theatre]**

MASTER: Wake up! Wake up! Ah. Welcome back. Would it surprise you to know that
one of your hearts stopped completely? You were within an inch of dying.  
DOCTOR: You wanted. You wanted to know how long I could hold out against that
machine. Well, the answer is I can't. Nobody can.  
MASTER: Of course you can! If I can control it from that console, then so can
you. And you must while I'm not here.  
DOCTOR: No, no.  
MASTER: Oh, come on, Doctor. We are both Time Lords.  
DOCTOR: Be that as it may, I know the secret of that machine. Inside is a
creature that feeds on the evil of the mind, and very soon it'll feed on
yours.  
MASTER: Nonsense! Mailer!  
(Mailer enters.)  
MASTER: Release him. And then put him in the cell with Miss Grant. Now listen,
Doctor, if you don't do what I ask of you, Miss Grant will be next in line for
the process. You just remember that. Right, take him out.  
MAILER: Come on, Doc. On your feet! Up!

**[Prison cell block]**

(Mailer has to just about carry the Doctor up the stairs.)  
MAILER: Come on, up you come.

**[Prison cell]**

MAILER [OC]: Come on, Doc, your feet are dragging! Now come on, help me.  
JO: Doctor! Doctor, is that you?

**[Outside the cell]**

MAILER: Down. Move! Move! Move!  
(At the bottom of the short flight of stairs the Doctor throws Mailer to the
floor and tackles Vosper.)  
VOSPER: No, you don't! Back!  
(Mailer gets up and is about to pistol-whip the Doctor.)  
MASTER: Mailer! I want the Doctor in one piece. Now put him in the cell as I
told you.  
MAILER: Come on, open this door!  
VOSPER: Yeah.  
(Mailer helps the Doctor into the cell by clubbing him.)

**[Prison cell]**

(Jo gets a glass of water for the Doctor as the Master enters.)  
MASTER: Good evening, Miss Grant. What a great pleasure it is to see you
again.  
JO: The Master! What are you doing here?  
MASTER: Oh, the Doctor will tell you about it when he's recovered.  
JO: What have you been doing to him?  
MASTER: Nothing. Just a little persuasion.  
JO: No.  
MASTER: Do try and make him see sense, my dear, for your sake. Goodnight.  
(The Master leaves.)  
MAILER [OC]: If you've got any sense, just hand him over to me and the boys
for an hour. We'll soften him up.  
MASTER [OC]: Mailer, all you will do is kill him. I don't want that.

**[Outside the cell]**

MASTER: I want an armed man outside this cell the whole time.  
VOSPER: Right, I'll do it myself.  
MASTER: Mailer, I want the whole B wing cleared except for these two in here.  
MAILER: What the hell for?  
MASTER: Don't argue, Mailer, do it. Then meet me in the Governor's office when
it's finished.  
MAILER: Yes. Sir.

**[Prison cell]**

MAILER [OC]: You hang on here, Len, yeah?  
VOSPER: Yeah, I'll be here.  
JO: Hey! Hey, you out there! Listen to me! We need help urgently.  
(Vosper opens the inspection hatch.)  
VOSPER: Go to sleep, darling.  
JO: Look, open this door. Please, open this door!  
(Vosper enters.)  
VOSPER: A proper little Miss Nightingale, ain't you?  
JO: Look at him. He needs a doctor.  
VOSPER: Pity.  
JO: Help me! Well, at least help me get him up onto the bed.

**[Process Theatre]**

(The reservoir dial on the humming machine reads Full.)  
MASTER: You can't harm me. I'm stronger than you are.  
(There is a battle of wills.)  
MASTER: I brought you here. I gave you the minds you need to feed on! You are
my servant! You are my servant! I  
(The Master is losing the battle. He goes to the control panel but the machine
will not switch off. The Master is confronted with his greatest fear - the
Doctor laughing at him.)  
MASTER: No! No! You can't destroy me! I am too strong for you! I am too strong
for you!

**[Prison cell block]**

(The Master flees, barring the door again. The prisoners are groaning.)  
MASTER: No more minds for you to feed on. Let's see how long starvation takes
to bring you to heel.

**[Prison cell]**

(Doctor Summers is listening to the Doctor's hearts in amazement.)  
SUMMERS: It's extraordinary. Quite extraordinary. His physical make-up, it's
just not human.  
JO: But what's the matter with him?  
SUMMERS: He's been beaten up, of course, physically and mentally. His whole
system's suffered a tremendous shock. He's in some kind of a coma, but I  
JO: Can't you do anything for him?  
SUMMERS: I very much doubt it. You could try giving him one of these, if he
recovers consciousness.  
(Summers gives Jo a bottle of tablets.)  
SUMMERS: (sotto) Listen, Jo, who organised this break?  
VOSPER: Right, Doc, time's up. What's the verdict? He done for?  
SUMMERS: Not quite. Though it's no thanks to you.  
VOSPER: Come on, Doc. Don't forget to send in your bill. Charlie?  
SUMMERS: Take care, hmm?  
JO: And you.  
(Charlie lets Vosper and Summers out of the cell. The Doctor moans.)  
JO: Doctor? Doctor, take one of these. Come on. Come on, just try.  
(Jo can't get the tablet in the Doctor's mouth.)  
DOCTOR: That's wrong, wrong metabolism. It'd probably kill me, Jo. I'm all
right. I'm all right, Jo. Just, just let me rest. Let me rest.  
JO: Doctor. Please.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

(The Master is exhausted and mopping his brow when Mailer enters.)  
MAILER: All right, fixed that. Here, you all right?  
MASTER: Yes, yes, of course, of course.  
MAILER: You don't look any too good to me.  
MASTER: Mailer, I want a guard on that process room the whole time. No one's
to go near that machine. No one.  
MAILER: I don't think any of my lot are likely to.  
MASTER: Yes, I know, but morbid curiosity can be very strong. See to it, will
you? Mailer! Mailer, you've done very well. I'm pleased with you.  
MAILER: Good. Then, er, perhaps you'd like to do something for me?  
MASTER: Why, certainly. Anything.  
MAILER: Perhaps you'd like to tell me why the hell we don't get out of here
before it gets light.  
MASTER: My dear Mailer, you are just not thinking. A great gang of armed
convicts roaming round the countryside?  
MAILER: If we can get our civvies back, there's cars outside.  
MASTER: Yes, maybe. But have you thought that as well as the police, you'd
have the army against you?  
(The Master sets up a small slide projector and screen and turns out the
lights.)  
MASTER: Dogs, troops, helicopters. Heh! By morning, you'd all be captured or
killed.  
MAILER: Yeah, all right. So, you've got a better idea?  
MASTER: I think so, yes. How would you like a free pardon, unlimited money and
a ticket to anywhere in the world?  
MAILER: How would I like it? Do me a favour.  
MASTER: Right, pay attention. I'll show you how to get it. Now, that is
Thunderbolt. It's a gas missile, nuclear powered and British, of course.  
MAILER: Of course.  
MASTER: The most important thing is that it's illegal, because gas warfare's
been outlawed for many years. Therefore the British government are going to
dump that in the sea. Now, tomorrow morning, that missile, with a very small
escort, will pass within a few miles of this prison.  
MAILER: I see, and you'd like me to hijack it?  
MASTER: Right first time.  
MAILER: Eh?  
MASTER: I'm going to aim that at the peace conference in London.  
MAILER: You've got to be joking.  
MASTER: I am not joking. You look at this map. Now, here's the prison, and
this is where you will ambush the convoy.

**[Prison cell]**

(Jo has slept in a chair. She wakes when Vosper enters.)  
JO: Doctor? Doctor?  
VOSPER: Morning. Oh, he's still with us then.  
JO: Sorry you're disappointed.  
VOSPER: You watch your tongue.  
JO: How about some breakfast?  
VOSPER: What do you think this is, a holiday camp?  
JO: You weren't told to starve us to death. What good do you think he's going
to be to the Master is he doesn't have any food inside him!  
VOSPER: All right, all right. Charlie!  
CHARLIE [OC]: Yeah?  
(Charlie enters.)  
VOSPER: Nip down the kitchens, get some grub for these two.  
CHARLIE: Right.  
(Charlie leaves.)  
VOSPER: Though by the look of him I don't think he's going to need it.  
(Vosper leaves. Jo sits and the Doctor gets up.)  
DOCTOR: Well done, my dear. Now perhaps we can do something about getting out
of here.

**[Prison courtyard]**

MASTER: Remember, if you're successful, this will be your passport to freedom.
Anywhere! All right, good luck to you.  
MAILER: Everybody got the picture? All right then, let's go. Now come along,
move!  
(The armed prisoners get into the back of the police van.)

**[Prison cell]**

VOSPER: (eating a piece of toast) Here's your grub then. I'll watch the door,
Charlie.  
(Vosper leaves as Charlie enters with a tray.)  
JO: I thought that was meant to be for us?  
CHARLIE: It's all right, there's  
JO: Thanks.  
(Jo reaches for the tray then slams it into Charlie's face before giving him a
karate chop to the back of the neck.)  
VOSPER [OC]: Charlie? Charlie, what's the matter?  
(Jo gives the Doctor the tray and they stand either side of the door as Vosper
enters.)  
VOSPER: What the devil's going on here?  
(The Doctor hits Vosper over the head, Jo takes the gun and they leave.)

**[Outside the cell]**

(The Doctor locks the cell door.)  
JO: Really, Doctor, for someone who was on death's door.  
DOCTOR: I do have remarkable powers of recovery, don't I? Come on!

**[Prison Governor's office]**

(The room is still in darkness. Jo looks out of the window.)  
JO: They seem to be setting up some kind of search party.  
DOCTOR: They'll be expecting us to try and make a break for it.  
JO: Well, aren't we?  
DOCTOR: No, not while they're all chasing around. Let them cool off for a bit.
We'll try again later.  
JO: Telephone. There must be a telephone here somewhere.  
DOCTOR: There is, but it's locked.  
(The telephone is in a wooden box.)  
DOCTOR: In any case, it'll be manned by convicts.  
(Jo turns on the slide projector.)  
JO: What's that?  
DOCTOR: That, my dear Jo, is the Thunderbolt. Captain Yates is escorting it. I
hope.  
JO: What's it got to do with the Master?  
DOCTOR: Everything. He's hoping to steal it.  

**[Country road]**

(Mailer leads his men to the ambush point.)  
MAILER: Get down!  
(The prisoners are down behind the fence.)  
MAILER: Right, now don't forget. Wait till they get level before you let them
have it.  
PRISONER: Here they come.  
(Two motorcycles followed by a Land Rover come into view. The truck with the
missile is behind them. The prisoners open fire. The motorcyclists fall, then
the Land Rover swerves into a ditch and the driver - Benton, apparently -
falls out. The police van is driven out to block the truck and the Sergeant
driving it is killed. Yates runs to safety.)  
YATES: Venus to Jupiter, Venus to Jupiter. Convoy under armed attack.
Estimated position  
(Yates is shot.)

**[UNIT office]**

BRIGADIER: Jupiter to Venus. Jupiter to Venus, give us your position. I say
again, give us your position! Over.  
(Static.)  
BRIGADIER: Right.

**[Country road]**

(Yates starts to recover, and gets the damaged radio.)  
YATES: Venus to Jupiter. Do you read me? Over.  
(Yates crawls along the hedge-line to see what is happening. The prisoners are
returning to the police van.)  
YATES: Venus to Jupiter, do you read me? Over.  
(The police van, truck and missile are driven away. Yates runs over to the
Land Rover to see Benton starting to move, then gets one of the motorcycles
and follows the thieves. Benton starts to get up then passes out again.)

**[UNIT office]**

BRIGADIER: The last time he checked in, he was here. Now, given the average
speed of the convoy and the time of the emergency call, the ambush should have
taken place about here. I want a chopper standing by to take me down there as
soon as possible.  
BELL: I'll get on to it right away, sir.  
BRIGADIER: And I'll need a mobile HQ and a full forensic team in the area.  
BELL: Extension three four. Shall I ask for police and army co-operation, sir?  
BRIGADIER: No, UNIT personnel only. This missile isn't supposed to exist. Keep
trying to get through to Captain Yates.  
BELL: Right sir.  
(The Brigadier leaves.)  
BELL: Jupiter to Venus. Jupiter to Venus. Do you read me? Over.

**[Airfield]**

(Yates follows the convoy onto what is labelled as MOD property where they
park up by a hangar.)  
MAILER: All right, let's get these doors open. Come on.  
(We see military personnel unhitching the missile from its trailer.)  
MAILER: Come on. In!  
(Yates watches the police van drive off, leaving the missile in the care of
the army and a small group of prisoners. They spot him riding away and shoot.
He falls and the bike crashes into a handy pile of crates. The prisoners run
over and drag Yates away.)

**[Country road]**

(Benton has had his head bandaged and is now being interrogated.)  
BRIGADIER: Is that all you can tell me?  
BENTON: It happened so quickly, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Did you see what happened to Captain Yates?  
BENTON: I thought they'd got him.  
BRIGADIER: Not unless they took the body with them. One of the bikes is
missing.  
BENTON: Well, maybe he followed them, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, maybe. Right, thanks.  
BENTON: There's just one thing, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Well?  
BENTON: Just before I passed out, I could have sworn I saw a plain black van.
The sort the police use. A black Maria.  
BRIGADIER: Map! Thank you. Stangmoor prison.  
BENTON: What, sir?  
BRIGADIER: Well, where else would you get a Black Maria?

**[Prison Governor's office]**

JO: Doctor, we can just go on sitting here.  
DOCTOR: Why not? It's the safest place at the moment. They'll never think of
looking for us here. Besides, I need more time to think. I've got to find out
a way of dealing with that alien creature out there.  
JO: What alien creature?  
DOCTOR: The one inside the Keller machine.  
JO: Do you really believe there's something alive in there?  
DOCTOR: I do.  
JO: Well, what is it?  
DOCTOR: It's a sort of mind parasite that feeds on evil. The deadliest threat
to mankind since the beginning of time.  
(Jo looks out the window.)  
JO: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Mmm?  
JO: The Master. He seems to be leaving.  
(The Master gets into his chauffeur driven car.)  
DOCTOR: Right. Now's our chance.  
JO: We'll slip out by the hospital and through the rear courtyard.  
DOCTOR: I didn't mean our chance to escape, Jo. I meant our chance to get into
that process chamber and deal with that machine once and for all.  
(Jo offers the Doctor the gun.)  
DOCTOR: No, thank you. You were trained to use those things. They only make me
nervous.  
(But in the Process Theatre, the Keller machine starts up and then vanishes.)

**[Prison cell block]**

(Charlie is searching the cells when the machine appears beside him. He tries
shooting at it, then screams and falls dead. The machine disappears. Jo and
the Doctor enter down a small spiral staircase.)  
JO: His face! He looks terrified, just like the others.  
DOCTOR: Perhaps the creature's learned to move. Come on.

**[Process Theatre]**

JO: You were right. It's gone!  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
MAILER: All right, girl, drop it! You heard me. I said drop it.  
(Jo drops her gun.)  
MAILER: Clever girl. As for you, we've had enough of you.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, before you pull that trigger, I  
MAILER: What's the matter with you?  
DOCTOR: Look, look behind you.  
MAILER: I've heard that one before.  
DOCTOR: Look behind you!  
(The Keller machine appears just outside the room. Vosper and Mailer hide
behind the double doors and try shooting at it, while the Doctor and Jo take
cover behind the control panel. Vosper dies and the machine moves on. The
Doctor and Jo come out of hiding just as the machine appears on its original
table. Mailer shoots at it then flees, leaving the Doctor and Jo alone with
the menace.)

__**Episode Five**__

**[Process Theatre]**

(The Keller machine vanishes.)  
JO: What happened? Why did it just disappear?  
DOCTOR: Well, we couldn't have tempted its appetite.  
JO: Why not?  
DOCTOR: Well, I imagine it detected a higher concentration of evil in Mailer.
There's something to be said for a pure mind, after all, eh, Jo?  
JO: Look, I think we'd better get out of here before it gets back!  
DOCTOR: Yes, all right, Jo! Jo! Wait a minute. Wait.

**[Prison cell block]**

JO: Barnham! What are you doing here?  
BARNHAM: Well, I was looking for you. I heard this noise and  
JO: It's all right. We're going to try and escape.  
BARNHAM: I don't understand.  
DOCTOR: Look, we've got to stop the Master from launching that missile. Now
come on, Barnham, you come with us.  
JO: Come on. Quickly! Come on!

**[Helicopter]**

BRIGADIER: Windmill three four seven

**[UNIT mobile HQ]**

BRIGADIER [OC]: To Trap One. How do you read me? Over.  
COSWORTH: Acknowledge that, will you, Sergeant? Trap One to Windmill three
four seven. Major Cosworth reading you loud and clear. Any results? Over.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: I'm over Stangmoor Prison now. No sign of the missile.
Everything seems quiet and normal. Over.  
COSWORTH: Are you going to land? Over.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: No, I don't think so. I know I said it seems normal but I'm
quite sure it's not. I'll continuing reccying for the moment. Over and out.

**[Prison room]**

DOCTOR: Well, there doesn't seem to be anybody about. Let's take a look
outside. (to Barnham) You wait here for a minute.

**[Prison courtyard]**

JO: Hey, look! It's the UNIT helicopter! Hey!  
(The Doctor and Jo wave.)  
PRISONER: All right, you two. Inside!

**[Prison room]**

PRISONER: Move!  
BARNHAM: Don't hurt them.  
PRISONER: Leave off, Barnham. I said move.  
(Barnham stands close up to the prisoner and takes hold of the rifle in both
hands. They struggle, but Barnham is easily the stronger.)  
BARNHAM: I said don't hurt them.  
PRISONER: No, no, Barnham.  
DOCTOR: Let him go. Let him go!  
(The Doctor stops Barnham from crushing the prisoners windpipe by a Venusian
karate move.)  
DOCTOR: Come on, let's get out of here.  
(Two more armed prisoners arrive.)  
BARNHAM: But they were trying to

**[Prison Governor's office]**

(Mailer is on the telephone.)  
MAILER: What the hell do you mean, we loused things up? You got your missile,
didn't you?

**[Hangar office]**

MASTER: You left one of the UNIT people alive and he followed you here.
Fortunately, he was caught.  
(Yates is tied up in a chair, unconscious.)  
MAILER [OC]: Look, I don't care about him. I want you back here right away!  
MASTER: That's quite impossible. I'm far too busy preparing the missile for
launching.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

MAILER: Look, mate, I don't care how busy you are. I want you back. That
machine of yours has broken out. It's wandering around the prison. It's killed
Lenny Vosper. It's nearly killed me!

**[Hangar office]**

MASTER: That's impossible, I can't leave here now.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

MAILER: Now listen. My mob's not staying on here while that thing's on the
loose. They'll start running and I'll be running with them.

**[Hangar office]**

MASTER: But you can't! You'll be caught!  
MAILER [OC]: Maybe. But just remember

**[Prison Governor's office]**

MAILER: If I get caught, so do you. They'll want to know where that missile is
and I might just tell them. Now think about it!

**[Hangar office]**

MASTER: I see. All right, Mailer. I'll come back.  
MAILER [OC]: That's more like it.  
MASTER: All right, Captain. You can stop pretending to be unconscious now.  
YATES: Why? Why  
MASTER: Why did I take the missile? I intend to use it.  
YATES: You'll never be able to. It's too complex.  
(The Master shows Yates a control panel.)  
MASTER: Nonsense! This is childishly simple. Anyhow, I have all the technical
assistance I need.  
YATES: Yes, I was going to ask you. About those soldiers.  
MASTER: Hired mercenaries in fake uniforms. Everything's a question of money
nowadays, my dear Captain. Will you excuse me? Oh, by the way, you're probably
wondering why you're still alive.  
YATES: It did cross my mind.  
MASTER: Well, in the event, in the highly unlikely event of UNIT finding us
before the missile's ready, you'd make a very useful hostage. Remember that.  
(The Master leaves and Yates starts to try and get himself free.)

**[Prison Governor's office]**

FULLER: Right, come on.  
MAILER: Where did you find them?  
FULLER: Outside B wing, waving to a helicopter.  
MAILER: You what? Did it see them?  
FULLER: Nah, I don't think so. Anyway, it's cleared off now.  
(Mailer points at Barnham.)  
MAILER: Get that zombie out of here. Get rid of him!  
(Fuller pushes Barnham out of the room.)  
MAILER: I don't know what we're going to do about you.  
DOCTOR: Look, Mailer, what  
MAILER: Back off.  
DOCTOR: Mailer, why are you helping the Master?  
MAILER: Helping who?  
DOCTOR: The Ma, er, er, Keller or whatever he calls himself.  
MAILER: Simple. I'm helping him because he's helping me.  
DOCTOR: Oh, what's he promised you?  
MAILER: Money, pardon, ticket to anywhere I like.  
DOCTOR: Do you really think he's going to keep those promises?  
MAILER: Why not?  
JO: He doesn't care whether you live or die. He's just using you.  
MAILER: So he's using me, I'm using him. You make me a better offer?  
DOCTOR: Let us go and I'll do the best I can for you.  
MAILER: Well, if that's the best you can do, Doc, it really ain't good enough.
Now, wheel 'em out.  
FULLER: Right, come on.

**[UNIT mobile HQ]**

BRIGADIER: I know exactly where that missile is. Here.  
COSWORTH: Stangmoor Prison, sir?  
BRIGADIER: It all adds up. Benton saw a Black Maria when the missile was
ambushed and I saw the Doctor and Miss Grant. I'm convinced the Master has
taken over the prison to be used as a hideout for that missile.  
COSWORTH: Then I assume we'll be taking the place, sir. I'll draw up an
assault plan.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Major Cosworth?

**[Brigadier's mobile office]**

(with a curtain for a door)  
COSWORTH: Sir?  
BRIGADIER: Have you seen Stangmoor Prison?  
COSWORTH: No, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Well, I've just been looking at it. It's an old fortress. You'd
need an army to get in there.  
COSWORTH: A fortress?  
BRIGADIER: That's right.  
COSWORTH: I suppose there couldn't possible be a secret underground passage or
something?  
BRIGADIER: Good, Major, good. Is that a map of the prison?  
COSWORTH: Yes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, you're right. It hasn't been blocked off either. It probably
leads to the old dungeons.  
COSWORTH: It's rather like making a film, isn't it, sir.  
SOLDIER [OC]: Greyhound seven to Trap One. Greyhound seven to Trap One.  
COSWORTH: Excuse me, sir.

**[UNIT mobile HQ]**

COSWORTH: It's all right, I'll take it. Go ahead, Greyhound seven.  
SOLDIER [OC]: A black saloon car has just entered the prison gates. Over.  
COSWORTH: Thank you, Greyhound seven. Maintain surveillance. Over and out.  
BRIGADIER: It must be the Master. They wouldn't let anyone else inside. Right,
that settles it! We're going to take that prison.  
COSWORTH: By using the underground passage?  
BRIGADIER: Yes. And also by using a Trojan Horse.

**[Prison cell]**

(The Doctor and Jo are playing draughts.)  
MASTER [OC]: I must say, you've taken your time about it.  
MAILER [OC]: Yes

**[Outside the cell]**

MAILER: Any trouble?  
FULLER: Not a squeak out of them.  
MASTER: All right. Open up, Fuller.

**[Prison cell]**

MASTER: Doctor, I  
DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush, shush. (The Doctor takes one of Jo's red pieces.)  
DOCTOR: There.  
MASTER: Doctor, I  
JO: Shush.  
(Jo takes all the Doctor's remaining pieces.)  
JO: There.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the trouble with this game is that it's too simple. In any
case, I'm more used to playing three dimensional chess.  
MASTER: All right, I've allowed you your little gesture. Now perhaps we can
talk seriously.  
DOCTOR: I suppose you're going to ask me to control that machine of yours
again.  
MASTER: I am.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I can't. I've told you before. Nobody can.  
MASTER: You underestimate yourself, Doctor. You are perfectly capable of
controlling it. For a time, at least.  
DOCTOR: Well, even if I could, why should I help you?  
MASTER: To save lives. Several people have died already.  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Most of them hard cases that were helping you.  
MASTER: Very well, then. To save one life.  
DOCTOR: My own?  
(The Master looks at Jo.)  
JO: Don't listen to him, Doctor. He's just bluffing.  
MASTER: Am I? Unless the Doctor does what I ask, Miss Grant, Mailer will shoot
you here and now.  
DOCTOR: Well, it's only a theory, but I think there may be one way to inhibit
that machine's power of movement.  
MASTER: And now is your chance to put that theory to the test.  
DOCTOR: Well where's the thing now? Still wandering about?  
MAILER: Gone back to the process chamber.  
MASTER: Temporarily glutted, no doubt.  
DOCTOR: Well, I shall need a lot of equipment, you know.  
MASTER: Oh, Stangmoor Prison's a very progressive place. The entire contents
of the workshop's at your disposal.  
DOCTOR: All right, I'll give it a try.  
MASTER: Good. All right, Fuller. Let us out, will you? No, Miss Grant. You
will stay here as a guarantee of the Doctor's good behaviour. After you,
Doctor. Satisfied, Mailer?

**[UNIT mobile HQ]**

BRIGADIER: Now we shall, as you realise, be very considerably outnumbered.
However, not all of our opponents will be armed and none of them will be
trained soldiers.  
COSWORTH: And, of course, we shall have surprise on our side.  
BRIGADIER: Exactly. Any questions?  
COSWORTH: No, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Right, carry on.

**[Brigadier's mobile office]**

COSWORTH: An excellent plan, if I may say so, sir. A very good chance of
success.  
BRIGADIER: Thank you, Major Cosworth. I'm very relieved to hear that.  
(A knock on the dividing partition.)  
BRIGADIER: Yes?  
BENTON: Excuse me, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Benton? What the devil are you doing here? You're supposed to be in
hospital.  
BENTON: Well, yes, sir. I discharged myself. I'm all right now. I've just got
a bit of a sore head.  
COSWORTH: I'll just get on, sir.  
(Cosworth leaves.)  
BRIGADIER: At ease, Sergeant. Well, what do you want?  
BENTON: I'd like to come on the assault, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Benton, you're supposed to be suffering from severe concussion.  
BENTON: I know, sir, but it's only a scratch, honest. And you said yourself,
I've got a thick skull. Anyway, I'd like a chance to get at the blokes who did
it.  
BRIGADIER: All right. If you feel fit, you can take charge of the underground
assault party. Major Cosworth will put you in the picture.  
BENTON: Thank you, sir. Sir, I  
BRIGADIER: Yes?  
BENTON: Well, I wondered if you'd had any news about Captain Yates, sir.  
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Benton, there's nothing. Nothing at all.  
(Yates manages to break the ropes holding him, but then pretends to be out
cold again when a prisoner comes to check on him. The prisoner leans over and
Yates grabs his head, throwing him to the floor. Then he takes the pistol and
leaves.)

**[Prison workshop]**

(As the machine sits in the process theatre across the hallway, its reservoir
full of black thoughts, the Doctor is fixing up a large coil of cable.)  
MASTER: Look, Doctor, you must hurry! If that thing in there starts moving
again  
DOCTOR: I'm well aware of the urgency of the situation, thank you. Right.
Excuse me, will you?  
MASTER: Oh.  
DOCTOR: Would you mind bringing that plug with you, please?  
MASTER: Oh, right.  
DOCTOR: And the coil.  
MASTER: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.

**[Prison cell block]**

(They go to a trolley with a large battery-like box on it. There is a slider
and several switches on it.)  
MASTER: Look, tell me, what precisely do you intend to do?  
DOCTOR: I'm going to try throwing this coil over that machine in there. If I
can get close enough to it without being killed, that is.  
MASTER: I see. Well, what can I do to help.  
DOCTOR: Well, I want you to operate these controls here and switch on to full
power when I call out.  
MASTER: This is very ingenious.  
DOCTOR: If all goes well, it should set up an electric current in the coil
alternating on much the same frequency as the beta rhythms of the human brain.  
MASTER: And you think that'll deal with it?  
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I think it'll confuse the creature enough to take
away its power of movement anyway.  
MASTER: Well, I hope you are right.  
DOCTOR: So do I.  
(The Master plugs the cable into the box, while the Doctor puts on protective
clothing.)  
DOCTOR: Now switch it on now, will you? Bottom one.  
MASTER: Right. Well, good luck to you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Right, you know what to do.  
MASTER: Yes.

**[Process Theatre]**

(The Doctor kicks open the doors and sidles in carefully. As he gets close,
the machine starts up and the coil that the Doctor is holding begins to spit
sparks. The nightmare images return as the Doctor struggles to get the coil
close to the machine.)  
DALEK [OC]: Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy! Exterminate! Annihilate!
Destroy! Exterminate!  
(He slams it down over the body of the machine.)  
DOCTOR: Now!  
DALEK: Annihilate!  
DOCTOR: Now!  
(Outside, the Master pushes the slider across the front of the box. Finally
the machine switches off and the Doctor removes his protective helmet and
gloves.)

**[Prison cell block]**

MASTER: Mailer. Mailer? Well, Doctor. Congratulations.  
DOCTOR: It won't hold it for long, you know. That thing's intelligent. Soon
it'll work out what happened and find a way to deal with it.  
MASTER: Then you'll have to think up something better, won't you. Now take the
Doctor back to his cell, Mailer.  
MAILER: Let's go.

**[Prison cell]**

JO: You all right, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Jo. I'm fine, I'm fine.  
JO: Did you fix the machine?  
DOCTOR: Yes, temporarily.  
JO: You look tired.  
DOCTOR: I am. Physically and mentally.  
JO: Hey, how about some food? Do you think they'd let us have any?  
DOCTOR: I doubt it. Not after what happened last time.  
JO: I've had nothing to eat all day. I'm starving.  
DOCTOR: Well, we shouldn't have thrown our breakfast at them, should we?  
JO: Breakfast! Hey, wait a minute. I knew they wouldn't bother to clear up.
Here you are.  
DOCTOR: Oh, no thanks, Jo, you have it. I'll do without food for a while.  
JO: No, we'll share it. And there's some water in the jug over here.  
DOCTOR: Oh, all right. Cheers.  
JO: Cheers.  
DOCTOR: Huh. Did I ever tell you about the time I was in the Tower of London?  
JO: No?  
DOCTOR: No?  
JO: No.  
DOCTOR: Well, I shared a cell with a very strange chap called Raleigh.  
JO: Raleigh?  
DOCTOR: Yeah, Sir Walter Raleigh.  
JO: Oh.  
DOCTOR: He got into some trouble with Queen Elizabeth. Elizabeth the first,
that is. He kept going on about this new vegetable of his he'd discovered, you
see, called the potato. One day, he sat down, pointed a finger at me

**[Prison]**

(A transit van arrives at the main gate and a man in overalls gets out to ring
the bell. He whistles 'Colonel Bogey' while armed soldiers creep out of the
back of the van. Eventually the prisoner dressed as a guard arrives.)  
BRIGADIER: Morning, mate. Provisions.  
PRISONER: What?  
BRIGADIER: Provisions. Nosh. Food.  
PRISONER: Back gate. You leave it at the inner gate. You can't come in here.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, it won't get in there, mate. Me van's too big.  
PRISONER: You'll have to clear off then.  
BRIGADIER: 'Ere, wait a minute. I've got a weeks supply of food in there, and
booze for the Governor. Am I supposed to go back and tell them you don't want
it? They'll think you're barmy.  
PRISONER: Hang about. (into R/T) Main gate here. I've got a big provisions
lorry. Do I let it in?  
MAILER [OC]: Yeah, okay. But I want him out of here fast.  
PRISONER: Drive up the main courtyard. Unload there. We'll give you a hand.
The, er, chief wants you out of here quick as possible.  
BRIGADIER: Don't worry. Less time I spend in there, the better.  
PRISONER: Okay, open up.  
(The Brigadier goes back to the van and drives it through the gateway, with
the three soldiers following close behind. They take out the gate guards as
they reach them.)

**[Prison outer ward]**

BRIGADIER: Come on, out!  
(We watch from up on the motte as other soldiers get out of the van and run
towards the inner ward. They go up a wooden stairway as the van is driven the
long way round.)

**[Prison courtyard]**

(The van is met by two prisoners.)  
BRIGADIER: The back's open.  
(The two prisoners are dealt with by the remaining troops. Shots are fired.
The Brigadier gets a megaphone.)  
BRIGADIER: This is Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart of UNIT. This prison is now in
military hands.  
(A sniper shoots the megaphone out of his hand, so the Brigadier kills the man
with a fast draw of his revolver.)

**[Prison cell]**

JO: It seems to be right inside the prison.  
DOCTOR: Yes. I only hope they can gain complete control before Mailer starts
killing the hostages.  
JO: So do I.  
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, yes.

**[Prison courtyard]**

(The Brigadier joins some of his men by the parked cars. He takes cover behind
Bessie then spots a prisoner on the ramparts.)  
BRIGADIER: There!  
(Benson leads his squad for an assault on the bailey. Both sides take
casualties, but more on the prisoners side than soldiers. When the shooting
stops, the Brigadier waves in a UNIT Land Rover carrying reinforcements.)  
BRIGADIER: Come on! I'm going to find the Doctor!

**[Prison cell]**

(Mailer enters, gun ready.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, come to give yourself up?  
MAILER: Now shut up and listen. You want to stay alive you'll do exactly as I
say.  
DOCTOR: Well?  
MAILER: You're going to help me get out of here. You're going to walk out of
here and tell those friends of yours that either I get out or I'm going to
chop you down. All right?  
JO: They won't listen.  
MAILER: Too bad for you if they don't. Come on, move!

**[Outside the cell]**

MAILER: And remember, no heroics. I can get out with either one of you. Up!

**[Prison cell block]**

(Partway down the stairs Jo falls backwards, knocking Mailer down too.)  
JO: Now, Doctor!  
(But Mailer grabs Jo round the neck and points his gun at the Doctor.)  
MAILER: That's you finished. I warned you. I only need one of you.  
(Mailer cocks the trigger and fires.)

__**Episode Six**__

**[Prison cell block]**

(Except it wasn't Mailer firing, it was the Brigadier. Mailer is dead.)  
DOCTOR: Thank you, Brigadier. But do you think that for once in your life you
could manage to arrive before the nick of time?  
BRIGADIER: I'm glad to see you too, Doctor. All right, Miss Grant?  
JO: Yes, thanks.  
DOCTOR: I see you've changed your job.  
BRIGADIER: Yes. Rather an effective disguise, don't you think?  
BENTON: Right, down there.  
BRIGADIER: Well, did you get the Master?  
BENTON: Sorry, sir. He seems to have got away.  
DOCTOR: What about the missile?  
BENTON: Well, we didn't  
BRIGADIER: Isn't it here?  
DOCTOR: No.  
BRIGADIER: Oh.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, apart from losing the Master and the missile, you're doing
very well, Brigadier.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

(At the airfield, the Master's car has arrived behind the missile, which is
part way out of the hangar. He gets out and nods, and the missile is aimed
upwards. Back at Stangmoor, the Brigadier is setting up a mobile HQ in the
Governor's office, complete with maps on walls and radio.)  
DOCTOR: Look, the Master has got to be found, Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER: I'm rather more concerned with finding that missile.  
DOCTOR: Well, it comes to the same thing, surely.  
(Benton enters, with Barnham under escort.)  
BENTON: Excuse me, sir?  
BRIGADIER: Yes?  
BENTON: Everything's secure, sir. The prisoners are back in their cells and
we're starting to move the wounded out.  
BRIGADIER: Right, Sergeant Benton.  
BENTON: Oh, and we found this chap, sir, hiding in the medical block.  
BRIGADIER: Lock him up with the others.  
BENTON: Right, sir.  
JO: No. No, no, don't. Come on, Barnham.  
BENTON: Right, Davies.  
(The soldier leaves.)  
JO: Come and sit down.  
BARNHAM: I heard, I heard the shooting and I didn't know what to do.  
JO: It's all right, it's all over. We'll take care of you. Has he been given
anything to eat?  
BENTON: Well, no, Miss, we were going  
JO: Well, don't just stand there, show me where I can find him something.  
BENTON: Yes, Miss. Sorry.  
(Jo and Benton leave.)  
BRIGADIER: Who is this man?  
DOCTOR: His name is Barnham. He's the last man to undergo the Keller process
and you can see what it's done to him. He's got the mind of a child. Don't
worry about him. You leave him to Jo. He trusts her. Right, let's take a look
of this map of yours.  
YATES [OC]: Trap One to Greyhound. Trap One to Greyhound.  
DOCTOR: It's Captain Yates.  
BRIGADIER: All right, I'll take it. Greyhound to Trap One. Is that you, Yates?
Where are you?

**[UNIT mobile HQ]**

YATES: I'm at mobile HQ, sir.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: What happened?  
YATES: Quite a lot. I know where he's got Thunderbolt.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Where?  
YATES: Outside a hanger on that deserted airfield at Stanham. He's got a
crane, launching pad, fake troops, the lot.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

BRIGADIER: Are you all right, Yates?  
YATES [OC]: A bit bashed about, sir, but I might just survive.  
BRIGADIER: Right, stay where you are. I'm on my way. Over and out. No need to
worry about the Master any more. This time, we've got him.  
(In the hangar office, the Master makes final adjustments to the Thunderbolt 2
control panel. Meanwhile, in the process theatre, the Keller machine burns out
its control collar.)  
BRIGADIER: Right, Sergeant Benton. You'll be in charge of the prison. You can
consider yourself Acting Governor.  
BENTON: Thank you, sir.  
(The Brigadier gets up, and Benton takes over the Governor's chair.)  
BRIGADIER: Oh, Benton?  
BENTON: Yes, sir?  
BRIGADIER: Don't get any delusions of grandeur, will you?  
BENTON: No, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Well, that about wraps it up, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Mmm?  
BRIGADIER: I said, that about wraps it up.  
DOCTOR: Does it?  
BRIGADIER: Major Cosworth's throwing a cordon around that hangar now. I'll
join him at mobile HQ and then we'll move in and mop things up.  
DOCTOR: You may not find the Master all that easy to mop up, Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER: I don't anticipate much trouble.  
DOCTOR: Well, don't forget he's got that rocket full of nerve gas. He can
point it at any city in Europe.  
BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Doctor. He won't get the chance. You coming with me?  
DOCTOR: No, not for the moment. I've got to work out a way of destroying that
machine of his. If I can step up the voltage in that coil  
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, er, I'll leave the machine to you, and you can leave
Master to me.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, all right.  
(Whilst the Doctor mutters his thoughts, the Keller machine is trying to
transport itself out of the collar. Furniture starts flying around the Process
Theatre until the power box outside explodes, along with the mains junction
box, then the collar breaks into pieces. Finally the nasty thing vanishes.)

**[Prison cell block]**

(Two prison officers are checking the area.)  
DAVE: Have you looked out here then, Bill?  
BILL: Yes, Dave, I have.  
DAVE: Oh no!  
(The familiar sound of the Keller machine starts up as it appears and rips
their minds apart.)  
BILL: No!  
DAVE: No, the pain. Please!  
(They die.)

**[Prison Governor's office]**

(The Doctor is drawing on a circuit diagram when Jo enters. She takes a bowl
to Barnham.)  
JO: Here you are, Barnham. Drink this up while it's hot.  
BARNHAM: Thank you very much, Miss.  
JO: Sergeant Benton will look after you. Won't you, Sergeant?  
DOCTOR: Right, that's it. That should just about do it, I think.  
JO: Wait for me!  
(The Doctor and Jo leaves. The telephone rings.)  
BENTON: Sergeant, Acting Governor Benton here.  
SUMMERS [OC]: It's Doctor Summers, Sergeant. I wondered if those medical
supplies had arrived yet.  
BENTON: Medical supplies? Hang on, Doctor Summers, I'll check.  
(Benton puts the phone down so he can go through a sheaf of papers. Barnham
picks it up.)  
BENTON: What do you think you're doing?  
BARNHAM: Doctor Summers.  
BENTON: You what?  
BARNHAM: Well, I'd like to talk to Doctor Summers.  
BENTON: Look, you go off and talk to who you like, okay?  
(Obediently, Barnham leaves.)  
BENTON: Hello, Doctor Summers. Yes, they seem to be here all right. They
should be on their way over to you now.

**[Prison cell block]**

DOCTOR: Oh my! The thing's escaped again!  
JO: How?  
DOCTOR: Well, it must stored up its energy and blown all the circuits. Let's
have a look.  
JO: Be careful.

**[Process Theatre]**

JO: What happened?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's stronger than ever now. How on earth am I going to stop it?  
(Outside, Barnham comes across the dead prison officers. His head is hurting
him.)  
JO: Will you be able to set the coils up again?  
DOCTOR: No, that'd never work twice. The thing's too intelligent. In any case,
I doubt whether I'd get near enough to it without being killed.  
(The machine appears on its table. Barnham enters.)  
BARNHAM: What's wrong?  
DOCTOR: Barnham, get out of here! Get back!  
BARNHAM: I heard this noise. I was  
(The machine goes quiet.)  
JO: It's stopped.  
BARNHAM: Machine. I remember this place. Something happened here.  
( As Barnham backs away, the machine starts up again.)  
BARNHAM: Something terrible!  
DOCTOR: Barnham, come back! Come back! Come back!  
(The Doctor grabs Barnham and uses him as a shield to approach the machine.)  
BARNHAM: No!  
DOCTOR: Over here!  
BARNHAM: No!  
(And the machine switches off again.)  
DOCTOR: Don't be frightened by it! Don't be frightened. That's it, that's it.
As long as you're here, it won't hurt us. Right, stay there. Stay there. Sit
yourself down, that's it.  
JO: But I don't understand.  
DOCTOR: The mind of evil, Jo. I should have realised. That creature feeds on
the evil impulses of the brain.  
JO: And Barnham hasn't got any.  
DOCTOR: No, the machine extracted them all. Something in his mind acts as a
screen and neutralises it. So long as he's here, we're perfectly safe.

**[UNIT mobile HQ]**

YATES: Afternoon, sir.  
COSWORTH: Afternoon, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Afternoon. How are you, Yates?  
YATES: Recovering rapidly, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Good. Sit down.  
YATES: Thank you, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Well, how's it going, Major Cosworth?  
COSWORTH: Fine, sir. I've just been on to the Ministry of Defence.  
BRIGADIER: And?  
COSWORTH: Thunderbolt is equipped with an abort mechanism. Once in go
condition, it can be blown up at any time.  
BRIGADIER: So, if the Master threatens to launch the missile, we simply blow
it up on the ground from here.

**[Process Theatre]**

(The Doctor has opened up the reservoir to reveal a slimy brain-like entity
with one staring eye.)  
JO: (In disgust.) Can't you kill it now, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: No. No, these creatures are incredibly resilient, Jo. It'd take an
atomic explosion or an enormous charge of electricity to destroy that.  
JO: So what are we going to do?  
DOCTOR: Well, I'm going to see. I'm going to see Sergeant Benton. Will you
wait here? Will you be all right until I get back?  
BARNHAM: I'm scared. It's evil.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. I'll be as quick as I possibly can, all right? Now, Jo
will look after you.  
(The Doctor leaves.)  
JO: What's your other name?

**[Prison Governor's office]**

DOCTOR: Now, are you sure you've got all that?  
BENTON: I think so, Doctor. Extra heavy duty cable, arrangements with the
National Complex for a maximum power boost. I'll get onto it right away.  
DOCTOR: Yes, please do. It's all extremely urgent.  
BENTON: It's going to take quite a bit of organising.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm quite sure it is, but neverthe  
(The phone rings.)  
BENTON: Acting Governor Benton here.

**[Hangar office]**

MASTER: Who?  
BENTON [OC]: Stangmoor Prison - Acting Governor Sergeant Benton here.  
MASTER: I see. Er, would the Doctor be there by any chance?  
BENTON [OC]: I'll see, sir. Who's calling, please?  
MASTER: Er, just say it's an old friend.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

BENTON: It's for you, Doctor. Say's he's an old friend of yours.  
DOCTOR: Hello? Yes?

**[Hangar office]**

MASTER: Oh, Doctor, do I gather that the tables have turned somewhat at
Stangmoor?

**[Prison Governor's office]**

DOCTOR: You have gathered correctly.

**[Process Theatre]**

SUMMERS [OC]: Barnham?  
(Summers enters.)  
SUMMERS: Jo, what on earth do you think you're doing? I told Barnham to stay
in the medical wing.  
JO: He can't leave. We've got to stay here with that thing.  
SUMMERS: But you'll get yourselves killed.  
JO: Doctor Summers, we have got to  
SUMMERS: Look, Jo! Jo, you know he's not well and that thing's dangerous. I've
got to get him back to the medical wing. Now, come on!  
(Summers drags Barnham towards the door and the machine starts up.)  
JO: No! No, you can't!  
SUMMERS: Argh! My head!  
(Jo leads Barnham back to the machine.)  
JO: Try, Barnham.  
(When Barnham sits down again the machine stops.)  
SUMMERS: That thing, it's alive!  
JO: Yes, and if Barnham leaves here, that thing will kill all of us.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

DOCTOR: In spite of what I've said, do you still intend to fire that rocket on
London?

**[Hangar office]**

MASTER: I most certainly do!  
DOCTOR [OC]: Well, that would start a world war.  
MASTER: Exactly! And then later when this planet is in ruins, I shall take
over.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

DOCTOR: I see. Aren't you forgetting something?  
MASTER [OC]: Am I, Doctor? What?  
DOCTOR: The dematerialisation circuit from your own Tardis.

**[Hangar office]**

DOCTOR: You can't leave Earth without that, can you.  
MASTER: Are you offering me a deal?

**[Prison Governor's office]**

DOCTOR: I am. Hand me back that rocket and I'll return your circuit.  
MASTER [OC]: That's very generous of you.  
DOCTOR: Leave Earth. Stop bothering us. Go somewhere else and be a nuisance
elsewhere. Well, what do you say?  
(The Master thinks it over.)  
DOCTOR: Well?  
MASTER [OC]: Right!

**[Hangar office]**

MASTER: But you will bring that circuit to me here at the hanger. You and you
alone. At the first sign of treachery, the first sign of interference from
your UNIT friends and I launch the missile immediately.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

DOCTOR: Sergeant, can you contact the Brigadier for me?  
BENTON: Well, I think so, Doctor. He should be back at mobile HQ by now.  
DOCTOR: Get onto him at once. Tell him he's got to cancel that attack.

**[Process Theatre]**

SUMMERS: You're quite sure there's nothing I can do?  
JO: No, honestly.  
SUMMERS: All right. Well, I've got a mass of wounded to attend to. I'll be in
the medical wing if you need me. Look after him, Jo. And yourself.  
JO: Thank you.  
SUMMERS: Now, you do exactly what Miss Grant tells you, all right? Good lad.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

(The Doctor is using the R/T.)  
DOCTOR: But understand that you mustn't go anywhere near him. If he catches
sight of a uniform, he'll fire that rocket.

**[UNIT mobile HQ]**

BRIGADIER: Don't you worry, Doctor. Leave everything to us. I've cancelled the
attack and we'll send a dispatch rider to HQ to get your circuit, just in
case.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

DOCTOR: What do you mean, just in case? It's our only chance.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Oh, I don't know, Doctor. There are other ways of dealing with
him.  
DOCTOR: Now look, don't do anything stupid, Brigadier. He means what he says,
you know.

**[UNIT mobile HQ]**

BRIGADIER: Don't you worry, Doctor. Over and out.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

DOCTOR: Lethbridge Stewart!  
BENTON: The Brigadier knows what he's doing, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: I sincerely hope so. I'm going back to Miss Grant.

**[UNIT mobile HQ]**

BRIGADIER: Right, Major Cosworth. I want you to get on to the missile control
people. They're to maintain radio link with us and explode the missile when I
give the word.  
COSWORTH: Right away, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Captain Yates, you'll be in charge of the evacuation. I want the
area around that hangar completely clear within a ten mile radius.  
YATES: Right, sir.  
COSWORTH: Trap One to missile control. Report my signal. Over.

**[Process Theatre]**

JO: But I don't see why you're so upset. If you give him back the circuit and
he hands over the missile  
DOCTOR: You just don't understand, do you, Jo? Once he gets that circuit back
he's free to roam through time and space. We'd never catch him.  
JO: Then you'll just have to give in. The Master's got the missile and all
we've got is this wretched machine.  
DOCTOR: Jo, will you stop stating the obvious. What did you say?  
JO: I said all we've got is this machine.  
DOCTOR: Well, that's it. That's the answer. We've got the machine and we've
got our friend, Barnham.  
JO: I don't understand.  
DOCTOR: With a little help from you, old chap, we can destroy this machine and
the Master at the same time.

**[Hangar office]**

(The Master takes a unit out of the control panel then flicks the switches
labelled Abort which are hidden under a cover.)  
MASTER: Just in case somebody tries to be clever.

**[Process Theatre]**

(The brain has got its cover back on. Barnham goes to pick it up, then
recoils.)  
JO: Don't worry. It can't hurt you.  
DOCTOR: Come on, old chap, come on.  
JO: It's all right.  
DOCTOR: That's it. All right? Now don't forget. Whatever you do, don't drop
it. Now hang on to it tight. Pick it up.  
(Barnham picks up the machine.)  
DOCTOR: Come on. That's it. Now, mind how you go. Mind how you go. All right?
Not too heavy for you? Good, that's it. Now close the doors after us, will
you, Sergeant?  
BENTON: Right, sir.  
DOCTOR: Now mind his feet.

**[Brigadier's mobile office]**

BRIGADIER: We tried to explode Thunderbolt on the ground, Doctor, but nothing
happened.  
DOCTOR: What did you expect? The Master may be a scoundrel but he is a
scientist. He'll have disconnected the abort mechanism.  
BRIGADIER: There's only one thing for it, Doctor. We'll have to give him back
that wretched circuit.  
DOCTOR: Oh, has it arrived?  
COSWORTH: Just arrived, sir.  
(The Doctor takes the caltrop shaped gizmo from the envelope.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's it.  
BRIGADIER: Believe me, Doctor, I hate to see the Master escape unpunished as
much as you do.  
DOCTOR: It's where he'll escape to that worries me. What right have we got to
let his loose on some other planet?  
BRIGADIER: Unless you've got some better plan, I can see no alternative.  
DOCTOR: My dear Brigadier, of course I have a better plan.

**[Hangar]**

(A Black Maria arrives, with Jo, Barnham and the machine in the back. The
Master greets the Doctor carrying a gun.)  
MASTER: Very strange form of transport, Doctor. I hope you're not going to try
anything silly.  
DOCTOR: No, of course not. No, it's just that Bessie had broken down.  
MASTER: Bessie?  
DOCTOR: You know, Bessie?  
(The Doctor mimes steering.)  
MASTER: Oh, yes!  
(The back of the van opens.)  
MASTER: I think I should warn you that my (mime) is aimed and ready to fire. I
just have to press the requisite button.  
DOCTOR: That's very clever.  
(The Doctor walks over to the missile, turning the Master's back to the van.)  
DOCTOR: My word, you have done well.  
MASTER: Shall we get on with it? Did you bring the circuit with you?  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Here.  
MASTER: May I examine it, please?  
DOCTOR: How do I know that you won't take the circuit and fire the missile
anyway?  
MASTER: I'm afraid you don't. You'll just have to trust me this once.  
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so.  
(The machine on the ground by the van.)  
JO: Now, Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Hai!  
(The Doctor kicks the gun out of the Master's hand, then he, Jo and Barnham
run into the hangar doorway as the Master flails on the ground next to the
throbbing machine.)  
JO: (into R/T) Hello, Brigadier? Jo Grant here. Over.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Hello, Miss Grant. We read you. Over.

**[Hangar office]**

JO [OC]: Doctor working on missile circuit. Stand by for abort instructions.
Over.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Well done, Miss Grant. Greyhound to Windmill three four two.
Come in to land. I say again, come in to land.  
PILOT [OC]: Wilco.  
(The Doctor finds where the component has been taken out of the panel, and
searches for it. The Brigadier and Cosworth wait for news. The Doctor finds
the unit and plugs it back in as the helicopter comes in to land. The Doctor
resets the controls and runs out.)

**[Hangar]**

DOCTOR: Right, Jo!  
JO: We're on our way. Over and out.  
DOCTOR: Come on!  
(They run to the helicopter past the Master still writhing on the ground by
the machine. Barnham stops and disrupts the effects so that the Master can get
up and into the driving seat of the van. He runs over Barnham and makes his
escape. The Doctor and Jo run back to their fallen friend.)  
DOCTOR: He's dead. Come on, Jo. Jo, come on.  
(Jo and the Doctor get in the helicopter and it takes off.)

**[UNIT mobile HQ]**

COSWORTH: Twenty seconds, missile control.  
BRIGADIER: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, abort!  
(KaBOOM! goes the missile, the hangar, and presumably the Keller machine and
Barnham.)

**[Prison Governor's office]**

(A soldier puts a tray of cups on the desk.)  
BRIGADIER: Thank you.  
JO: We took Barnham there to help us.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, Jo. I know.  
JO: We should never have left him there.  
DOCTOR: Well, how do you think I feel?  
JO: Sorry.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Here, have some coffee.  
BRIGADIER: Well, at least we're rid of the Keller machine, and the Master.  
DOCTOR: Yes, we've probably killed off that machine all right, but I'm not so
sure about the Master.  
BRIGADIER: Well, even if he wasn't killed, Doctor, he won't get far if you've
still got his circuit.  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's true.  
(The Doctor checks his pockets.)  
DOCTOR: The circuit. I must have lost it in my struggle with him.  
BRIGADIER: Probably destroyed in the explosion.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but what if it wasn't? Supposing the Master found it?  
(The telephone rings.)  
BENTON: Hello, Governor's office?  
MASTER [OC]: Put me on to the Doctor, will you?  
BENTON: Yes. It's for you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: The Master? Yes?

**[The Master's Tardis]**

MASTER: Ah, Doctor. I was afraid you'd be worried about me, so I thought I'd
let you know that I'm alive and well.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

DOCTOR: I'm extremely sorry to hear that.

**[The Master's Tardis]**

MASTER: I made the safety of my Tardis which, thanks to your generosity, is in
perfect working order.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

DOCTOR: So, we won't be seeing you for quite some time.  
MASTER [OC]: Not for quite some time.

**[The Master's Tardis]**

MASTER: But one day, I will destroy this miserable planet and you along with
it. Goodbye, Doctor. Oh, by the way, enjoy your exile.

**[Prison Governor's office]**

JO: What did he say?  
DOCTOR: His usual threats.  
JO: Never mind, Doctor. You've beaten him.  
DOCTOR: Have I, Jo? He's got his Tardis back. He's free to come and go where
he pleases, while I'm stuck here on Earth (pause) with you, Brigadier!
