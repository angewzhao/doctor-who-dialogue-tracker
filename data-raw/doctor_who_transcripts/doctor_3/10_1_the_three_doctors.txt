Original Airdate: 30 Dec, 1972  

__**Episode One**__

**[Outside the Lodge]**

(A long, silver weather balloon has brought its payload to earth by the edge
of a lake, and a man carrying a shotgun finds it. Meanwhile, a Land Rover
comes over the bridge at the entrance to the Minsbridge Wild Life Sanctuary
and heads for the warden's lodge. A woman comes out to meet it.)  
MRS OLLIS: Doctor Tyler, is it?  
TYLER: Yeah. Sorry to be a trouble. Thanks very much for calling.  
MRS OLLIS: Arthur's keeping an eye on it, down by the lake. He hasn't touched
it.  
TYLER: Oh good.  
MRS OLLIS: It's not chemicals, is it? Only the birds, you see.  
TYLER: No, you'll be all right. Nothing to worry about.

**[Lake side]**

(The orange payload is clearly marked with Doctor Tyler's name and contact
details at Wessex University, and the word Reward in three languages. As the
Land Rover drives round the side of the lake towards Arthur Ollis, the box
starts make a crackling sound. There is a flash, and Ollis vanishes. The birds
take off from the lake in fright. Tyler arrives and looks around for Ollis.)  
TYLER: Mister Ollis! Mister Ollis?  
(Tyler goes back to his Land Rover and gets on the radio.)  
TYLER: Put me through to UNIT HQ will you, please?

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(Jo brings in a tray of drinks.)  
TYLER: So there you are. Mrs Ollis says her husband's down there, I see him
wave, get there and there he is, gone. So I got in touch with you lot.  
BRIGADIER: Well quite right too. That's what we're here for, eh, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes of course.  
JO: What exactly is this machine for?  
TYLER: Cosmic Ray Research, Miss Grant.  
JO: And you still use balloons?  
TYLER: That's right. We may not be NASA, but we get the results. Inside that
is the most sophisticated Cosmic Ray Monitoring device between here and Cape
Kennedy. You see, I was going to get in touch with you people anyway, even
before this business.  
BRIGADIER: Oh? Why was that?  
TYLER: Can you give me that briefcase, please?  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course.  
TYLER: Well, we've been getting some pretty funny results on these latest
tests. Now this is the first one you see. Ah, this is normal.  
(Tyler hands the Doctor an x-ray picture.)  
TYLER: Now then, this is why I'm here. Last week's test. Now, look at that.  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Good grief.  
(The second image is very narrow compared to the first.)  
TYLER: Yeah. Nobody knows what to make of it. Well, they've all seen it.
Yanks, and the other lot.  
BRIGADIER: Oh?  
TYLER: Now here somewhere, oh yes. Now this is what really put the tin hat on
it. From that deep space monitor Houston put up. Just take a look at those
readings.  
(Tyler shows a large printout to the Brigadier.)  
BRIGADIER: Er, the Doctor's the  
TYLER: What?  
BRIGADIER: The Doctor's the man you  
TYLER: Oh, I see.  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Well, it's travelling faster than light.  
TYLER: Yes. And it can't, can it. I don't know what to make of it. It's come
all that way, through millions of star systems. It must have been directed,
and it must have been directed at us. Now why?  
DOCTOR: Why indeed, Professor Tyler, why indeed.  
BRIGADIER: Thing is, Doctor, is there anything I can do?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Pass me a silicon rod will you?  
(The rod is passed from the Brigadier to Tyler to Jo to the Doctor, who stirs
his drink with it.)  
BRIGADIER: Yes, what I meant was, is there anything that UNIT can do about
this space lightning business?  
DOCTOR: Lightning? Yes, I suppose it could look like lightning, only it isn't.
No. If there where such a thing I would say it was compressed light. A sort of
controlled superlucent emission.  
BRIGADIER: A what?  
JO: He means it travels faster than light.  
BRIGADIER: Thank you, Miss Grant.  
DOCTOR: Tell me, Professor, is this machine of yours functioning properly?  
TYLER: Far as I can tell. Haven't developed that latest plate yet, of course.  
DOCTOR: Then I suggest that you do so immediately and let me know the result
of your findings. Jo, you and I are going to take a look at the scene of the
crime.  
JO: Right.  
DOCTOR: I think you'll find everything you need here.  
TYLER: Oh, right. Er, thanks.  
(The Doctor and Jo leave. Tyler takes the x-ray plate from the box and starts
using lab equipment.)  
TYLER: Oh, I can manage now, thank you.  
BRIGADIER: I'm delighted to hear it. Make yourself at home. We're only
supposed to be a top secret security establishment. Liberty Hall, Doctor
Tyler. Liberty Hall.  
(The Brigadier leaves. Tyler checks his watch then gets the developed image
from the machine.)  
TYLER: That shouldn't happen.  
(He puts the image on a light box. It looks like a face contorted in fear.)  
TYLER: That definitely shouldn't happen.  
(Tyler starts dismantling the box, and it begins crackling. There is a flash,
and Tyler has vanished. Then some red and blue energy creeps out of the box
onto the bench.)

**[Lake side]**

(The Doctor's Geiger counter is rattling away.)  
MRS OLLIS: This here's the place all right.  
JO: Are you sure, Mrs Ollis?  
MRS OLLIS: Well, the Land Rover tracks stop here, don't they? I told you,
you're too late. The other gentleman's been and gone.  
DOCTOR: You haven't seen your husband since this morning?  
MRS OLLIS: No. Nothing unusual in that. Oh, he'll be off somewhere. We shan't
see him now until dark. I'll look for him if you like.  
DOCTOR: No. No, it's not important.  
MRS OLLIS: Please yourself. I'll be getting on then.  
(Mrs Ollis walks off.)  
JO: It is important, isn't it, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Jo. Yes, it's much more important than I thought.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

BRIGADIER: Doctor Tyler, these reports might interest  
(The Brigadier realises the room is empty.)  
BRIGADIER: Tyler? Doctor Tyler? Sergeant Benton!  
(Benton enters.)  
BENTON: Sir?  
BRIGADIER: Doctor Tyler appears to be wandering around UNIT Head Quarters. Go
and find him and bring him here at once.  
BENTON: Yes, sir.

**[Behind UNIT HQ]**

(The top secret HQ is actually well advertised. The notice in front of the
Denham Manor clearly states Ministry of Defence U.N.I.T. Headquarters
Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart No Unauthorised Entry - without a guard to be
seen. The Doctor and Jo drive round the back to the garage area and park up.)  
DOCTOR: Right, let's see what Doctor Tyler's found out about that plate.  
JO: What's that?  
(A bright red and blue something is coming out of the drain in the middle of
the area.)  
DOCTOR: Jo! Back slowly away behind the car. Do as I say!  
(The thing is growing.)  
JO: What is it?  
DOCTOR: When I tell you to run, you run. Right, run!  
(They run for the shrubbery as there is a flash and Bessie vanishes. The
Doctor and Jo peer out from behind a tree.)  
JO: What happened? What is that?  
DOCTOR: I don't know.  
(The Thing goes back down the drain.)  
JO: Poor old Bessie.  
DOCTOR: Right, Come on.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(Benton enters.)  
BRIGADIER: Well, where is he?  
BENTON: Sorry sir, we just couldn't find him. Doctor Tyler has just
disappeared. We've searched the grounds and the buildings, sir, and there's no
sign of him. Oh, and there was an explosion in the garage, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Explosion? What explosion? I heard nothing.  
(The Doctor and Jo enter.)  
DOCTOR: No, you wouldn't, Brigadier.  
BENTON: But there was a flash, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: A flash, yes, not an explosion. It was a release of kinetic energy.  
BRIGADIER: One of Bessie's gadgets misfire?  
JO: It's far more serious than that, Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER: You'd better check, Benton.  
BENTON: Right, sir.  
DOCTOR: No. I shouldn't go anywhere near it. Not just at the moment.  
BENTON: What shall I do, sir?  
DOCTOR: I suggest that you put a guard on the drains, Benton.  
BENTON: The drains?  
DOCTOR: Yes, the drains!  
BRIGADIER: Put the men on stand by, Benton.  
BENTON: Right away, sir.  
(Benton leaves.)  
DOCTOR: All right, Brigadier. Now then, what's the situation as you see it?  
BRIGADIER: Well, I've just had a call from Mrs Ollis. Her husband hasn't
returned.  
JO: Oh, no.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I was rather afraid that might happen.  
BRIGADIER: We're cooperating with the local Police, but we have got fifteen
hundred acres to cover.  
DOCTOR: Well, I shouldn't bother going on looking for him, Brigadier. I think
you'll find that that's Mister Ollis.  
(The Doctor shows the Brigadier the new image.)  
BRIGADIER: Is this the plate that Tyler was developing when we left?  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right.  
BRIGADIER: When I came back with these satellite reports, Tyler had
disappeared and this box was open as it is now.  
DOCTOR: Nothing's been moved?  
BRIGADIER: Nothing.  
DOCTOR: Excuse me a minute, will you?  
BRIGADIER: Hmm.  
(The Brigadier and Jo stand back as the Doctor waves his Geiger counter over
the box. Background only until he gets to the sink and plug hole.)  
DOCTOR: All right, Brigadier, go on.  
BRIGADIER: These are tracking reports and assessments from just about every
country in the world.  
DOCTOR: Thank you. It looks as if Tyler was right. That light beam or whatever
it is, seems to have scanned the Earth like a searchlight and picked on us.  
BRIGADIER: Since UNIT is now in charge of this investigation, Doctor, it would
help if you were a little more forthcoming.  
JO: Tell him about Bessie, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Huh? Oh, yes. Well, Brigadier, now Bessie has disappeared.  
BRIGADIER: What?  
JO: But it was after us.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, but what was after you?  
DOCTOR: Well, some kind of powerful organism thing with a very strong hunting
instinct.  
JO: It was hunting you, wasn't it, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so.  
BRIGADIER: Are you trying to tell me that this whole thing has been arranged
just for your benefit?  
JO: Oh yes, that's right. You see that stuff simply ignored me as soon as it
saw the Doctor.  
BRIGADIER: What about this chap Ollis?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. Well, perhaps this thing was confused, or its
instructions weren't getting through.  
BRIGADIER: And Tyler?  
DOCTOR: Tyler? Yeah. Yes, that was its second mistake, here in this laboratory
where I usually work. And its third mistake was Bessie.  
JO: And you were in Bessie.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
BRIGADIER: And you think there's a link between the beam and this, this
organism thing.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. I think that that beam was the method it used to get here.  
BRIGADIER: Well, now it's arrived, and it's hostile, and it's still here, so
what do we do and how do we find it?  
DOCTOR: We don't find it, Brigadier. If we wait around here long enough, it'll
find us.

**[Outside UNIT HQ]**

(Three strange objects appear out of nowhere, looking like snowmen made of red
balls. Apparently these are called Gel guards.)  
GUARD: Holy Moses! What's that?  
(The objects advance, growling.)  
GUARD: Get Sergeant Benton, quick!  
(The second soldier runs inside. Meanwhile, more of the objects appear in the
woodland around the buildings.)  
BENTON: How many of them?  
GUARD: I'm not sure, Sarge. They seem to be springing out all over the place.  
BENTON: Right. You hold them off here, and I'll cover the back. Right, you men
come with me. Hurry.  
(Two soldiers stay with the guard.)  
GUARD: Fire at will!  
(Bullets have no effect. One object raises a claw-like hand and fires. There's
a big bang and just two soldiers retreat.)

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(Watching from the window.)  
BRIGADIER: What are those creatures? Where are they coming from?  
DOCTOR: Obviously from the same source as that organism thing. First the
scout, then the reinforcements.  
BRIGADIER: Their grasp of military tactics is very good.  
JO: Well, let's hope Sergeant Benton's are even better.

**[Outside UNIT HQ]**

(More Gels are popping into existence on the lawns. A machine gun is brought
out and set up.)  
BENTON: Hurry, men, and keep your heads down.  
(The machine guns is soon destroyed. By a handy signpost to the Laboratory and
Stores, one of Benton's men fires a bazooka which seems to stop one.)  
BENTON: Great shot, Johnson.  
(But it keeps coming. Benson reports in.)  
BENTON: Brigadier, do you read me? Over.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: What's the situation, Benton? Over.  
BENTON: We're under attack from all sides. Weapons are useless. Nothing seems
to touch them. Nothing. Over.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

BRIGADIER: Get the men out, Benton. Complete evacuation, then report to me in
the laboratory. Is that clear? Over.  
BENTON [OC]: Okay, lads, fall back! Complete evacuation. I want everyone out
of the building. Everybody. Now, move.  
BRIGADIER: I'd better see what's happening. You stay here, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Not much point in my going anywhere else is there?  
(The Brigadier leaves, and the Thing comes out of a vent in the corridor.)  
DOCTOR: I think you ought to get out of here too, Jo.  
JO: Not a chance. I'm staying right here with you.  
DOCTOR: Now please, Jo, do as I ask. They won't harm you. You ignore them,
they'll ignore you. I'm the one they're after.  
JO: Well, I'll just have to risk it, won't I?  
(Benton climbs in through the window.)  
BENTON: Right, Jo, Doctor, have you seen the Brigadier?  
DOCTOR: Sergeant Benton. Just the man I wanted to see. Will you please take
Miss Grant with you? Even if you have to carry her.  
BENTON: I'm sorry, Doc, my orders were to report to the Brigadier.  
DOCTOR: Your orders, Sergeant  
(There is a flash, and the doors and part of the wall vanish.)  
DOCTOR: Into the Tardis, quickly!

**[Tardis]**

(This is Benton's first time, so he looks around as the doors close.)  
DOCTOR: Right, force field on.  
(The Thing zaps the laboratory bench.)  
JO: You were going off without me, weren't you?  
DOCTOR: Well, Sergeant, aren't you going to say it that it's bigger on the
inside than it is on the outside. Everybody else does.  
BENTON: It's pretty obvious, isn't it? Anyway, nothing to do with you
surprises me anymore, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you for the complement.  
(The Doctor pulls a lever but there is only a thudddd sound. He tries again.)  
DOCTOR: It's not reacting. There's only one thing for it. I'll have to send an
SOS. I hate having to call them, but, there we are.  
JO: What were you planning to do, anyhow?  
DOCTOR: I was planning to lure that stuff away from Earth, Jo, but now as it
seems to have immobilised the Tardis, I'm not going anywhere. We're trapped.  
JO: So what are we going to do?  
DOCTOR: At least we can watch that thing in comfort, and then we can send in a
report and see what they have to say about it.  
BENTON: Who are they?  
JO: The Time Lords. Oh, things are pretty serious.  
DOCTOR: Yes, they are.  
(The scanner flickers into life. and the Extreme Emergency red light flashes.)

**[Time control]**

(On a planet far away in time and space.)  
PRESIDENT: Is the Doctor holding out?  
TIME LORD: We are giving his Tardis all the energy we can spare.  
PRESIDENT: And the hostile?  
TIME LORD: Unidentified so far, my lord.  
CHANCELLOR: And the source of this beam?  
(The Time Lord brings it up on his wall screen.)  
PRESIDENT: You see, Chancellor? The black hole.  
CHANCELLOR: That's a nowhere, no place, a void. According to all known laws,
nothing can exist there.  
PRESIDENT: Yet somehow, through this black hole, vital cosmic energy is
draining away in spite of all we can do to check it.  
CHANCELLOR: Already the time travel facility is in danger, my lord.  
PRESIDENT: Without it, we shall be helpless. Unless the energy loss is stopped
the whole fabric of space time will be destroyed. We are being consumed and we
can find no way to fight back.  
CHANCELLOR: Are you telling me we are up against an adversary, a force, equal
to our own?  
PRESIDENT: Equal and opposite to our own.  
CHANCELLOR: A force which inhabits a universe where by definition even we
cannot exist?  
PRESIDENT: Yes. A force in the universe of antimatter.  
CHANCELLOR: But that's too terrible to contemplate. Someone must go and help
the Doctor.  
PRESIDENT: I agree, but no one can be spared, your Excellency. Everyone is
needed to combat the energy drain.  
CHANCELLOR: Are you saying we can't help him?  
PRESIDENT: Yes, I am, but perhaps he can help himself. Show me the Doctor's
time stream, the section for his earlier self before he changed his form.  
CHANCELLOR: You can't allow him to cross his own time stream. Apart from the
enormous energy it would need, the First Law of Time expressly forbids him to
meet his other selves.  
PRESIDENT: I am aware of that, your Excellency, but this is an emergency.  
CHANCELLOR: But you can't!  
PRESIDENT: Your Excellency, I have to.  
CHANCELLOR: Be it on your own head.  
(The Chancellor leaves.)  
PRESIDENT: Now, show me.  
(The image on the screen changes to Patrick Troughton running from something,
as usual.)

**[Tardis]**

(There is a materialisation sound, but the time rotor is still.)  
DOCTOR: That's odd. Nobody touched anything did they?  
BENTON + JO: No.  
DOCTOR: But you heard it though, didn't you?  
JO: Yes, and felt it too. Could it be that stuff outside?  
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so. Hello, what's this?  
(There is a descant recorder on the console. He picks it up.)  
DOCTOR: It seems strangely familiar. Is it yours, Jo?  
JO: A flute? No.  
DOCTOR: Well, properly speaking it's a recorder.  
DOCTOR 2: Thank you.  
(First of all Patrick's hand takes the recorder then the rest of him appears.
Jo gasps.)  
DOCTOR 2: I was wondering where that had got too.  
(He blows a few notes.)  
DOCTOR 2: You haven't been trying to play this have you? Oh. I can see you've
been doing the Tardis up a bit. Hmm. I don't like it.  
(He looks at the scanner.)  
DOCTOR 2: Oh my word.  
(The Thing is wrecking the laboratory.)  
DOCTOR 2: Oh dear, we are in trouble, aren't we. Just as well I turned up.  
JO: Doctor, who on earth  
BENTON: Doctor! Where did you spring from?  
DOCTOR 2: Now don't tell me. Corporal Benton, isn't it?  
BENTON: Sergeant Benton now.  
DOCTOR 2: How do you do, my dear fellow.  
BENTON: Nice to see you.  
DOCTOR 2: I haven't seen you since that nasty business with the Cybermen.  
BENTON: It happened all those years ago.  
JO: Who is he and how did he get in here.  
DOCTOR: Well it's a bit difficult to explain, Jo.  
JO: He's not one of them, is he?  
DOCTOR: Well, not so much one of them as one of us. One of me to be precise.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, my dear, I hate to be contrary but I
can see he's a little bit confused, poor old chap, and I do feel you should
have the correct explanation. You don't mind, do you.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
DOCTOR 2: I didn't think you would. You see, Jo. I may call you Jo, mayn't I?
You see, he is one of me.  
JO: Oh, I see. You're both Time Lords.  
DOCTOR 2: Well quite. Well, not quite.  
JO: Oh.  
DOCTOR 2: Not, not just Time Lords. We're the same Time Lord.  
DOCTOR: Now please, you're only confusing my assistant. Jo, it's all quite
simple. I am he and he is me.  
JO: "And we are all together, goo goo ga joob?"  
DOCTORS: What?  
JO:  It's a song by the Beatles.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, how does it go?  
DOCTOR: Oh, please be quiet.  
JO: Look, is he really you?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I'm afraid so.  
BENTON: I think he is Miss Grant. You see, when the Brig and I first met the
Doctor, he looked like him.  
JO: How?  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I'd like to know. You've got no right to be here.  
DOCTOR 2: Perhaps  
DOCTOR: What about the First Law of Time?  
DOCTOR 2: Perhaps I could explain?  
DOCTOR: Perhaps you could.  
DOCTOR 2: Well, our fellow Time Lords out there are just as much under siege
as we are.  
DOCTOR: What?  
DOCTOR 2: And they couldn't send anyone to help you. But they did summon up
enough temporal energy to lift me out of my bit of our time stream and pop me
down here, into my own future, so to speak.  
DOCTOR: Why?  
DOCTOR 2: My dear fellow, you are being a bit dim, aren't you? Your
effectiveness is now doubled!  
DOCTOR: Halved, more like.  
DOCTOR 2: Now, now. There's no need to be ungracious. Suppose we have a look
at our problem, shall we? Er, you don't mind, do you?  
DOCTOR: Oh, be my guest.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, thank you.

**[Outside the Laboratory]**

SOLDIER: Good grief, sir. What's that?  
BRIGADIER: Don't just stand there, man. Open fire!  
(He does. There is a flash and the water dispenser in the corridor next to
them vanishes.)  
SOLDIER: Sir!  
BRIGADIER: Fall back!

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR 2: Dear old Lethbridge Stewart. Still blazing away as usual.  
BENTON: Can't we do something to help them, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: They'll be all right as long as they keep out of its way. Right, now
you can see our problem, can't you.  
DOCTOR 2: Yes. Most unpleasant. They are very worried, you know.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and so am I. I think perhaps I ought to put you in the picture.  
DOCTOR 2: Right.  
(The two Doctors stand side by side and close their eyes.)  
DOCTOR: Contact.  
DOCTOR 2: Contact.  
(After a few moments they open their eyes again.)  
DOCTOR 2: I see. So it's after you, or should I say us?  
DOCTOR: That's right. And as they can't help us, we'll just have to help
ourselves.  
DOCTOR 2: Twinkle, twinkle little star.  
(And starts to play it on the recorder.)  
BENTON: Now what was all that about?  
JO: A sort of telepathic conference, I think.  
DOCTOR: Must you?  
DOCTOR 2: Are we going to take this attitude to my music all the time?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm rather afraid we are.  
JO: Oh dear.

**[Time Control]**

(The Time Lords are watching the scene in the Tardis.)  
TIME LORD: We've achieved a transference, sir.  
PRESIDENT: Splendid.  
TIME LORD: But I don't think it's going to work.  
PRESIDENT: Why, what's wrong?  
TIME LORD: They refuse to co-operate.  
PRESIDENT: I see. Well, we'll soon settle that. Show me the earliest Doctor.  
TIME LORD: Him too, sir? But surely  
PRESIDENT: Show me.  
(William Hartnell is in a garden.)  
PRESIDENT: He'll keep them in order.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR 2: Well, you've been fiddling with it, haven't you?  
DOCTOR: It was perfectly all right until you touched it. Now if only you'd
leave things to me.  
DOCTOR 2: If we were to leave things with you, my dear fellow, we'd be in a
fine pickle, wouldn't we.  
DOCTOR: Look, you lost the image, not me.  
BENTON: There they go again.  
DOCTOR 2: I did not loose the image!  
DOCTOR: I set this thing up  
JO: Doctor, look. Both of you!  
DOCTOR: What?  
JO: Look.  
(The scanner shows William inside a pyramid shape. He was too ill to act,
bless him.)  
DOCTOR 1: [on scanner] Ah, there you are. I seem to be stuck up here. Hmm?
Hmm? Oh, so you're my replacements. Huh. A dandy and a clown. Have you done
anything?  
DOCTOR 2: Well, we've, er, assessed the situation.  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Just as I thought. Nothing.  
DOCTOR: Well it's not easy, you know.  
DOCTOR 2: It's not as if we know what that stuff is.  
DOCTOR: No.  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Then I'll tell you. It's a time bridge.  
DOCTOR 2: It's a what?  
DOCTOR: I see.  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Now, what's a bridge for, eh?  
DOCTOR 2: Well, er  
DOCTOR: Crossing?  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Right. So stop dilly-dallying and cross it!  
(The image fades.)  
DOCTOR 2: No! No wait!  
DOCTOR: You faded him again.  
DOCTOR 2: I did not fade him. You saw  
DOCTOR: Yes, you certainly did.  
JO: I hate to ask, but who was that?  
DOCTORS: Me. Me!  
(Patrick takes a coin from his pocket.)  
DOCTOR 2: Call, will you?  
DOCTOR: Heads.  
(Patrick tosses the coin, catches it and looks at it then puts it back in his
pocket without letting Jon see it.)  
DOCTOR 2: Hard luck.  
DOCTOR: All right. Stand by to disconnect the force field.  
BENTON: What are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: Now!  
JO: Doctor, no!

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(The Doctor runs out of the Tardis into the lab, followed by Jo.)  
DOCTOR: Jo, get back!  
(There is a flash of light and they both vanish.)

__**Episode Two**__

**[Tardis]**

(Benton runs to the door.)  
DOCTOR 2: Steady now, Sergeant. He knows what he's doing. At least I hope he
does.  
BENTON: Yes, but what about Jo?  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, it's a pity she ran after him like that. Let's have a look,
shall we?  
BENTON: Will they be all right?  
(The scanner image shows the Tardis in the corner of the lab, and the massive
red and blue Thing pulsing nearby.)  
BENTON: Well, where are they? Doctor!  
DOCTOR 2: As far as I can see, that stuff's gone to a great deal of trouble to
find me, er, him, so whoever or whatever it was that sent it can't merely want
to kill him. No, no, they've been transported somewhere.  
BENTON: Transported? What do you mean, transported? Transported to where?  
DOCTOR 2: No, wait a minute. Do you know, Sergeant, I think our friend has
gone off the boil, so to speak.  
BENTON: Right then. Now I'm going to take this chance to blow it to bits. I'll
get a grenade. We'll soon see  
DOCTOR 2: No, I think we could try a more subtle approach. Let's turn off the
force field and open the doors first, shall we?  
BENTON: Right.  
DOCTOR 2: Wait a minute. Let me go first.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(They step out carefully, Benton with his sub-machine gun at the ready.)  
DOCTOR 2: Hmm. Awaiting further instructions, I would think.  
(The Thing suddenly crackles and they dash back into the Tardis. It settles
down again and they come out again.)  
BENTON: You're not going near that thing, Doctor, are you?  
DOCTOR 2: It's all right. I think it was just hiccups. Fascinating.  
(The Thing crackles again.)  
BRIGADIER: For heaven's sake be careful, Doctor!

**[Outside the UNIT Laboratory]**

(Patrick and Benton go into the corridor through the remains of the wall.)  
DOCTOR 2: No, no, Brigadier. Leave it alone. It's not dangerous for the
moment. It seems to think it's achieved its mission.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, no.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, yes.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, but you're not the  
BENTON: Yes, it is, sir. It's the first one.  
DOCTOR 2: How are you, Brigadier?  
BRIGADIER: Pretty well, thanks. Doctor, what the blazes are you doing? Why
have you changed your appearance? And what's happened to Miss Grant?  
(The Doctor and Jo have just appeared, lying on their sides, on some dirty
rocky ground somewhere.)  
DOCTOR 2: There you are. It's all quite simple really.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, I'm sorry. Well, I don't believe a word of it. Look,
just tell me this. Are you or are you not the Doctor that I met during the
Yeti business, and then later when the Cybermen invaded?  
DOCTOR 2: Of course I am. You can see that.  
BRIGADIER: Right. But then you subsequently appeared on Earth during that
trouble with the Autons, only then you'd changed into a tall, thin fellow.  
DOCTOR 2: Had I really? How fascinating.  
BRIGADIER: Doctor, I warn you.  
DOCTOR 2: It's no use your asking me about all this, Brigadier. As far as I'm
concerned, it hasn't happened yet. Don't you see? I'm just a temporal anomaly.  
BRIGADIER: It's quite obvious to me what's happened. You've been mucking
around with that infernal machine of yours.  
BENTON: Be careful, sir.  
BRIGADIER: You've been mucking around with that infernal machine of yours, and
somehow or other you've changed back your appearance and shot poor Miss Grant
off to heaven knows where.  
BENTON: It's not quite as simple as that, sir, honestly.  
BRIGADIER: Now that'll do, Benton. Just two things I want from you, Doctor. An
effective way of controlling that stuff and the safe return of Miss Grant.  
BENTON: What about our Doctor, sir? Don't you want him back?  
BRIGADIER: Enough of that nonsense, Benton. I've got him back. As long as he
does the job, he can wear what face he likes.  
DOCTOR 2: Well, I'll do my best, but I can't make any promises.  
BRIGADIER: In that case, you'd better consult those all-powerful superiors of
yours for their advice.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, I don't think that'd do any good. At the moment they're far from
being all-powerful. That's why it's been left up to me and me and me.

**[Time Control]**

CHANCELLOR: What's happening?  
TIME LORD: It's draining our power as fast as we pump it in, sir.  
CHANCELLOR: Yet you continue to waste the power we so urgently need. What is
more, by permitting the Doctor to meet his other selves, you have transgressed
the first and most important law of time.  
TIME LORD: I know that, your Excellency, but this is an emergency.  
CHANCELLOR: No emergency can justify this transgression. This operation must
stop immediately.  
PRESIDENT: On the contrary, it must continue. The Doctor is our only hope.
There is no one else.  
CHANCELLOR: I could wish for more hope than that.  
PRESIDENT: Your Excellency, you have said yourself we are dealing with a
threat from an area over which even we have no control. A black hole in space.
The universe of antimatter. Unknown forces at least equal and opposite to our
own.  
CHANCELLOR: But the first law of time must be obeyed!  
PRESIDENT: It will be obeyed, later. For the moment the Doctor needs all the
help he can get. We can't stop now. Transporting his other selves across the
time stream has already utilised more energy than we can afford.  
CHANCELLOR: Criminal irresponsibility.  
PRESIDENT: They have only a limited time together, and if they do not succeed
we shall lose our time travel facility and become as vulnerable as those we
are pledged to protect.  
CHANCELLOR: You would do better to husband your resources, not throw them away
on what is no more than a dangerous gamble.  
PRESIDENT: I am prepared to take that risk.  
CHANCELLOR: I understand your attempt to transport yet one more Doctor has met
with only limited success.  
PRESIDENT: His transportation unit became trapped in a time eddy. At the
moment he can do no more than advise, but the second Doctor is assisting UNIT
to help with matters on Earth.  
CHANCELLOR: I see. And the other?  
PRESIDENT: He, together with his companion, has passed into the black hole.
They are over the absolute event horizon.  
CHANCELLOR: Theoretically, they're dead.

**[Planet surface]**

DOCTOR: Jo? Jo? Can you hear me? Jo, wake up.  
JO: Where are we? Everything seems so strange.  
DOCTOR: Are you all right?  
JO: We're not?  
DOCTOR: Jo.  
JO: We are, aren't we. We're dead.  
DOCTOR: This is a place. It's just like any other place. Well, almost. We've
been brought here. Anyway, it's not much like heaven, is it. Come on, let's go
and take a look around.  
(They start walking through the quarry, watched by one of the Gels.)

**[Outside the Laboratory]**

DOCTOR 2: So wherever they are, Miss Grant and my other self, we can't contact
them. That's the problem with antimatter. You can see the effect but never the
cause. It's like being punched on the nose by the invisible man.  
BRIGADIER: Then what's this stuff?  
DOCTOR 2: The invisible man. Antimatter.  
BRIGADIER: But I thought you said that matter and antimatter couldn't meet
without an explosion.  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, that's right.  
BRIGADIER: So, it shouldn't exist here, but it does.  
DOCTOR 2: Yes. Awkward, isn't it? As far as I can see, there's only one
explanation.  
BRIGADIER: Yes?  
DOCTOR 2: Well, this stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are.
Unfortunate, isn't it.  
BRIGADIER: And there's nothing that even you can do?  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, I wouldn't say that. We can make sure it stays harmless for a
start.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, that's a relief. Look, can I leave you to get on with that?
Those other things are still outside there. I must contact Geneva.  
(The Brigadier leaves. Patrick searches through all his pockets.)  
BENTON: Doc, I think the strain's been a bit too much for him. What are we
going to do now?  
DOCTOR 2: Keep it confused. Feed it with useless information. I wonder if I
have a television set handy.

**[Planet surface]**

(The Doctor and Jo come across the water dispenser and a computer unit.)  
DOCTOR: That's odd.  
JO: Hey, surely that's the water cooler from outside the lab.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
JO: And what's this?  
DOCTOR: Well, that's the Brigadier's computer.  
JO: Oh.  
DOCTOR: Look, this is the lab door.  
JO: It's locked.  
DOCTOR: Well, it says No Admittance.  
(They walk past the coat hanger to the workbench with the weather balloon box
on it.)  
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, we both know what that is, don't we?  
JO: Sure do.  
DOCTOR: Er, Jo, do you see what I see?  
JO: Oh, yes!  
DOCTOR: That clinches it. We have been transported, and so has all this stuff.
Come on.  
(They walk down a slope and get into Bessie.)  
DOCTOR: Right. All we've got to do is find out where we are and who brought us
here.  
JO: Right, come on then.  
DOCTOR: Where to?  
JO: Twice round the park?  
DOCTOR: Right.  
JO: Right.  
(And off they drive, watched of course. Bessie stops further on and they get
out to look at a set of boot prints in the chalk.)  
DOCTOR: Man Friday, would you believe?  
JO: At the moment, I'd believe anything.  
DOCTOR: Come on.  
(They set off to follow the prints, and Arthur Ollis peers over a ridge.)

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(Patrick has set up a large dish on a stand attached to a transformer while
the Thing crackles gently in the corner.)  
DOCTOR 2: It's quite like old time, eh, Sergeant?  
BENTON: Yes, it is, isn't it. Is it ready yet?  
DOCTOR 2: Hmm? Oh, nearly ready for testing.  
BENTON: Look, Doc, why don't we give this great big blancmange the full
treatment now?  
DOCTOR 2: Now steady on, Sergeant.  
(The Brigadier enters.)  
BRIGADIER: Right, come on, Doctor. Security Council want an explanation and
I'm leaving it all up to you.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, no.  
BRIGADIER: They're on video in my office.  
DOCTOR 2: But won't they think it strange? I mean, me?  
BRIGADIER: I've explained all that. You're his assistant.  
DOCTOR 2: His what!  
BRIGADIER: I decided the truth was too much for them. Assistant it will have
to be. Well?  
DOCTOR 2: Well, I've just set this thing up! Now I won't be able to confuse
it!  
BRIGADIER: No doubt. It seems to be your forte, Doctor, confusing people.
You're sure that thing's all right?  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, as quiet as a lamb. We've got it thoroughly subdued, haven't
we, Sergeant.  
BENTON: We haven't tested it.  
BRIGADIER: All right then, Benton, you'd better keep an eye on it.  
BENTON: Me, sir?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, you.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, very well. Here you are, Sergeant, you'll need this. Now if it
gives the slightest trouble, a little dose of that will settle it.  
(Patrick hands over a control pad with a red button.)  
BENTON: Yes, but say that doesn't work, Doctor?  
DOCTOR 2: Then give it the lot! Come on, Brigadier.  
(Patrick and the Brigadier leave. Benton hangs the control on the dish and
unwraps some chewing gum.)  
BENTON: Now you're not going to give me any trouble, are you, okay?  
(The Thing starts crackling and Benton picks up the control. He gives it a
short burst of a crackle from the dish, then a second. It has no effect.)  
BENTON: Doctor? Doctor, are you there?  
(Benton turns the machine on full.)  
BENTON: Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!  
(Patrick runs round the corner followed by the Brigadier.)  
DOCTOR 2: What is it? Oh!  
BRIGADIER: Benton, what have you done?  
BENTON: I did what the Doctor told me, sir, but it wouldn't work. It's gone
mad.  
DOCTOR 2: Into the Tardis, quickly! Come on, Brigadier!  
(The doors close just before the big flash.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR 2: Yes, it's quite cozy, isn't it? Oh, you'll soon get used to it, old
chap. Relative dimensions and all that.  
BRIGADIER: So this is what you've been doing with UNIT funds and equipment all
this time. How's it done? Some sort of optical illusion?  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, no, no, no. They come like this. Really.  
BRIGADIER: Yeah.  
BENTON: Hey, Doc, it's going berserk out there.  
(Lots of flashes on the scanner.)  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, it is, isn't it.  
BRIGADIER: All right, now we're in here, what do we do?  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, we have a think. Care for a jelly baby?

**[Planet surface]**

(Someone is been writing equations in the chalk.)  
TYLER: E equals MC squared. There's no doubt about that. But if you equate
gravitation with acceleration, I must have travelled faster than the speed of
light. That's impossible. By definition, the light here must be travelling
backwards, but I can still see.  
JO: Who's that?  
DOCTOR: It's Doctor Tyler. Doctor Tyler!  
TYLER: Huh? Why, it's the Doctor, isn't it? And Miss Grant.  
JO: How did you get here?  
TYLER: Well, I was in your lab, developing that plate, and there was some kind
of an explosion and here I am. Oh, it's fascinating.  
JO: Do you know where we are, Doctor Tyler?  
TYLER: No, I don't. Do you, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes. We're at the other end of that light streak of yours.  
TYLER: What?  
DOCTOR: We've been transported along it.  
TYLER: That's in the black hole.  
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. That's where we are. On a stable world in a universe of
antimatter. An anomaly within an impossibility.  
JO: Huh?  
TYLER: What he means is that a place like this shouldn't exist in a cosmos
like this, and even if it does, we shouldn't be here anyway. I think.  
JO: Oh.  
DOCTOR: Well, here we are. Kidnapped and marooned. But by whom?

**[Throne room]**

(Someone is watching them on a screen set into the rock wall.)  
OMEGA: At last, a Time Lord within my power. Let my guests be brought into my
presence.  
(The masked figure wearing a cloak like the Time Lords do, sends one of the
Gels off to do his bidding.)

**[Planet surface]**

DOCTOR: Well, these things sound very much like the creatures that attacked us
at UNIT HQ.  
JO: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: What exactly did they look like?  
TYLER: Like that.  
(There are a pair of them on the cliff above them. Jo screams.)  
DOCTOR: Run!  
(But a set of explosions go off all around them, so they surrender instead.
Ollis is watching from a safe vantage point.)

**[Tardis]**

BRIGADIER: Doctor, will you open this door?  
BENTON: It's still thrashing about out there, sir.  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, it is, isn't it. My little plan seems to have misfired. I seem
to have accentuated its metabolic rate  
BRIGADIER: Doctor!  
DOCTOR 2: Most unfortunate. It shouldn't have happened. Now, what went wrong?  
BRIGADIER: Will you let me out of this contraption!  
DOCTOR 2: The beam should have desensitised. Of course, you fool. It's
antimatter! The opposite effect! Instead of quietening down, I've stimulated
it.  
BRIGADIER: Will you stop nattering?  
DOCTOR 2: You haven't seen my recorder anywhere, have you? It's a little thing
about this long with holes in. I had it when I came in and I put it down
somewhere and I can't find it.  
BRIGADIER: For the last time, will you let me out of this madhouse!  
DOCTOR 2: There's no point.  
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Doctor, but I'm afraid I must insist. My place is with
the men out there, trying to do something about this, well, whatever it is out
there, not standing around here messing about looking for some damn fool
flute!  
DOCTOR 2: Brigadier, I cannot open that door without first turning off the
force field, and even if I did, you'd never make it across the floor. That
thing out there has become a killer. It's my fault and I'm sorry.  
BRIGADIER: Sorry?  
DOCTOR 2: All we can do now is think, and I think best to music. Now, where is
my recorder?

**[Omega's palace]**

(Jon, Jo and Tyler are escorted into a corridor built like the Gels, of bright
balls.)  
JO: It looks like Aladdin's cave.  
DOCTOR: It's the entrance to some sort of palace, I should imagine.  
TYLER: I wonder who it belongs to?  
DOCTOR: I've no idea, but I expect we'll soon find out.  
JO: I'm not sure that I really want to.  
TYLER: Whoever had us brought here doesn't mean us much good.  
JO: I have a feeling you might be right.  
TYLER: And I don't fancy hanging around to meet him. I'm going to try and make
a break for it.  
DOCTOR: What?

**[Tardis]**

(The Brigadier gets a radio handset out of his pocket.)  
BRIGADIER: Corporal Palmer, this is the Brigadier. Do you read me? Over.  
DOCTOR 2: You're wasting your time. You'll never get through with the force
field on.  
BRIGADIER: I've got to find out what's going on out there.  
DOCTOR 2: Let's have a look at this thing.  
(Patrick starts to take the handset apart.)  
DOCTOR 2: I'll try to set you up a communications unit.  
BRIGADIER: Be careful.  
DOCTOR 2: It's all right. Don't worry. I can boost this through the Tardis's
communication circuit. I think.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, I give up.  
BENTON: With respect, sir, aren't we wasting time?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, we are.  
DOCTOR 2: Are you still worried about your other Doctor, Sergeant?  
BENTON: Well, yes, I am, and Miss Grant.  
DOCTOR 2: Well, I shouldn't worry too much if I were you. In fact, I rather
envy them.  
BENTON: You what?  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, I think they're having a very interesting time.

**[Omega's palace]**

TYLER: The time to make a getaway is now, while we're still near the entrance.
Once they get us down that maze of passageways we shall never get out.  
DOCTOR: My dear Doctor Tyler, I don't want to get out. I want to meet our
host. I allowed myself to be brought here for that very purpose.  
TYLER: Perhaps you did, Doctor, but we didn't want to come here and we don't
want to stay.  
DOCTOR: Don't you understand? You were both brought here by accident. Your
only chance of getting back lies in my persuading whoever brought you here to
send you home.  
TYLER: I prefer to take a chance on my own. How about you, Miss Grant? Are you
coming with me?  
JO: No. No, I'll stick with the Doctor, thank you.  
TYLER: Looks like I'll have to go on my own then.  
DOCTOR: Doctor Tyler, you're not going anywhere.  
TYLER: What?  
DOCTOR: I refuse to allow you to endanger all our lives.  
TYLER: No. No, I suppose you're right.  
(Tyler makes a dash for it.)  
DOCTOR: Tyler! Tyler, come back! Tyler!  
(Gels stop the Doctor from following.)  
DOCTOR: Idiot. He'll jeopardise the entire operation.  
JO: With his life, probably.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
(A Gel follows Tyler through the passages.)  
JO: They might not harm him. You said we were only here by mistake.  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, Jo. I'm the one they're after. I'm sure I can
persuade our host to send you back.  
JO: But supposing you can't? Well, they might just get rid of us.  
(Tyler's way is blocked by a Gel. He retreats.)  
DOCTOR: Jo, we're dealing here with a creature of great intelligence, and
superior intelligence and senseless cruelty just do not go together.  
JO: Oh, I hope you're right.  
(Tyler runs back to them and falls.)  
JO: Tyler!  
DOCTOR: Tyler! Come on, get up. Up, up. Are you all right?  
TYLER: Yes, I think so. Thanks. That was a bit of a waste of time, wasn't it.

**[Tardis]**

(The Brigadier paces while Patrick works on his handset.)  
DOCTOR 2: Here we are, Brigadier. Have a try with that. It's all right, it
won't bite you.  
BRIGADIER: Corporal Palmer? Come in, Palmer.  
(All he gets is crackling, so the Pat bashes it against the Tardis console a
couple of times.)  
PALMER [OC]: Corporal Palmer here. Over.  
BRIGADIER: Corporal Palmer, this is the Brigadier. Now listen. We're pinned
down in the laboratory. What's the situation there? Over.  
PALMER [OC]: Ah, sir, we've been trying to reach you. The building is still
surrounded but we're just standing by for further orders. Over.  
BRIGADIER: Now listen, Palmer. I want every man to maintain vigilance, but no
further offensive action, is that clear? Over.  
PALMER [OC]: But sir, I thought  
BRIGADIER: That's an order, Palmer!  
PALMER [OC]: Roger, sir. Wilco.  
BRIGADIER: Keep in contact. Out.  
BENTON: Doc.  
DOCTOR 2: Hmm?  
BENTON: Hey, Doctor, it's the old boy.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, excuse me.  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Made any progress?  
DOCTOR 2: No, none at all. And you?  
DOCTOR 1: Hardly. I'm trapped in this infernal time eddy.  
DOCTOR 2: What about our fellow Time Lords?  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Growing steadily weaker. They can't seem to check their
energy loss.  
DOCTOR 2: We can't help you, I'm afraid.  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Oh yes, you could.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh? How?  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Well, first turn off your force field.  
DOCTOR 2: What? But I don't  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Off, I said.  
DOCTOR 2: But I still don't see  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Oh, use your intelligence.  
(The image fades.)  
BRIGADIER: Who in the name of heaven was that?  
DOCTOR 2: I'm afraid you'd never believe me.

**[Palace]**

(Jon, Tyler and Jo are being escorted through the passageways.)  
TYLER: It still doesn't make sense, Doctor. We are matter, and you say this
place is antimatter.  
DOCTOR: That's right.  
TYLER: So, the mere fact of our being here should cause a colossal explosion.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, our bodies have been converted, processed in some ways, so
that we can exist here.  
JO: Just as that organism thing could exist in our world?  
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly.  
TYLER: I just don't believe it. This is matter. I can see it. Why, I can feel
it.  
DOCTOR: But things aren't always as they seem, you know, Doctor Tyler. Now,
you take this pencil, for example.  
TYLER: It's just a pencil, isn't it?  
DOCTOR: Ah, but is it? Watch very, very closely.  
(The Doctor holds the pencil out vertically, at arms length, then lets go with
a flourish. It vanishes. Another flourish and )  
DOCTOR: Or is it a bunch of flowers?  
TYLER: Ah ha, that's all very well, but that's just a conjuring trick.  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what this place is, a scientific conjuring trick
of a very high order. I think the waiting is over.  
(There is a strange growling yet burbling noise, and the Gels usher them along
again. Jo leaves behind the fake flowers on the floor.)

**[Tardis]**

BRIGADIER: But you're not going to turn off the force field?  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, I think so.  
BRIGADIER: But why?  
DOCTOR 2: Because he told me to, and I've always had a great respect for his
advice.  
BENTON: Doctor, if you switch the force field off, that thing out there can
get at the Tardis.  
DOCTOR 2: Precisely! Hold tight, everyone.  
(Outside UNIT HQ, the Gels suddenly vanish. Then the building itself vanishes
and falls into the black hole, leaving Corporal Palmer and his men in the
gardens, staring at the empty space.)

__**Episode Three**__

**[Throne room]**

(The Gels escort Tyler, Jo and Jon into the main room.)  
JO: It's fabulous!  
DOCTOR: Yes, most impressive, I must admit that.  
TYLER: Almost worth the trip just to see this place.  
JO: Yes, but who brought us here, and why?  
(A figure appears at the top of a short flight of stairs.)  
OMEGA: I did. I am the one who brought you here.  
DOCTOR: Who are you?  
OMEGA: In the legends of your people I am called Omega.  
DOCTOR: Omega? But that's impossible. Omega was destroyed.  
OMEGA: No, brother Time Lord, I was not destroyed, as you can see. Take the
man and the girl.  
DOCTOR: Where are you taking them?  
OMEGA: They will not be harmed, Doctor. They have no part in my revenge.  
(Gels take Jo and Tyler out.)  
OMEGA: I have been grievously wronged, Doctor, and now it is time for my
vengeance!

**[Room]**

{Jo and Tyler step into a blue room.)  
TYLER: Well, they won't hold us long in here. Not in a cell without a door.  
JO: Look!  
(The open doorway becomes a solid piece of wall.)  
TYLER: It's impossible! It's a real wall.  
JO: Really? What kind of a place is this? And who was that creature in the
mask?  
TYLER: I don't know.  
JO: The Doctor seemed to know him.  
TYLER: Yes, and whoever it was knew the Doctor, but I wouldn't say they were
exactly friends.  
JO: No, it seemed more like they were deadly enemies.

**[Throne room]**

OMEGA: Without me, there would be no time travel. You and our fellow Time
Lords would still be locked in your own time, as puny as those creatures you
now so graciously protect.  
DOCTOR: You knew your mission was dangerous.  
OMEGA: Dangerous, yes, but I completed it, and I did not expect to be
abandoned. Many thousands of years ago, when I left our planet, all this was
then a star until I arranged its detonation.  
DOCTOR: You were the solar engineer. It was your duty.  
OMEGA: It was an honour, or so I thought then. I was to be the one to find and
create the power source that would give us mastery over time itself.  
DOCTOR: Well, you succeeded, and are revered for it.  
OMEGA: Revered? Here? I was abandoned.  
DOCTOR: The histories say that you were lost in the supernova.  
OMEGA: I was sacrificed to that supernova. I generated those forces, and for
what? To be blown out of existence into this black hole of antimatter? My
brothers became Time Lords, but I was abandoned and forgotten!  
DOCTOR: No, not forgotten. All my life I've known of you and honoured you as
our greatest hero.  
OMEGA: A hero? I should have been a god!

**[Room]**

JO: Why would the creature bring the Doctor here if they're deadly enemies?
Unless he means him some terrible harm.  
TYLER: Come along, Jo, pull yourself together. No point in getting worried
about this. We don't know that they're enemies. In any case, I'm sure the
Doctor knows what he's doing.  
JO: I hope you're right.

**[Throne room]**

DOCTOR: Well, theoretically, of course, all this is quite impossible.  
OMEGA: Here, Doctor, everything is possible. Be seated.  
(And an ornate gold chair appears.)  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Tell me, how did you manage to survive?  
OMEGA: How does anyone survive? Force of will. Mind, you might say, over
antimatter.  
DOCTOR: And this organism stuff that you sent to bring us here?  
OMEGA: Created from the raw stuff of matter. An organism that can exist in
your world and mine. It brought you here and imbued you with its properties so
that you too could exist in both worlds.  
DOCTOR: But how do I fit into this picture?  
OMEGA: There are some things that even I cannot do, not alone, and at this
point in my plans I need the help of a brother Time Lord.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I see.  
OMEGA: And it pleases me to use you against them.  
DOCTOR: And if I give you my help, do you really think you can defeat the Time
Lords? All of them?  
OMEGA: But I am defeating them, Doctor. All of their power is insufficient to
prevent the cosmic energy drain which I have caused.  
DOCTOR: And if I refuse to cooperate?  
OMEGA: Then you will face the wrath of Omega, you and those miserable humans
who accompany you.  
(A communications device beeps. Omega goes over to it and hears a message made
up of high pitched beeps.)  
OMEGA: Investigate immediately but do not harm them.  
DOCTOR: Them?  
OMEGA: Well, Doctor, it seems that we have more company.

**[Tardis]**

(Patrick, the Brigadier and Benton all land on their feet just after the
Tardis touches down.)  
DOCTOR 2: Well, we appear to have arrived.  
BRIGADIER: (into mike) Corporal Palmer. Come in, Palmer.  
DOCTOR 2: I don't think you'll get through with that thing.  
BRIGADIER: Why not?  
DOCTOR 2: It hasn't quite got the range.  
BRIGADIER: What are you talking about, Doctor? They're only just outside the
building.  
DOCTOR 2: Brigadier  
BRIGADIER: Corporal Palmer, do you read me?  
DOCTOR 2: I think you should prepare yourself for a bit of a shock.  
BENTON: Can we take a look outside, Doc?  
DOCTOR 2: We can try.  
(The scanner shows the Tardis in the lab.)  
DOCTOR 2: Well, I never.  
BENTON: It seems to have gone, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, it looks quiet enough. Right, Doctor, if you'll just
open that door, I'll see what's going on.  
DOCTOR 2: I really wouldn't advise it.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, come along now, Doctor.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, all right. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, I do wish you'd listen to
me. Come along, we'd better follow him.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

DOCTOR 2: That's extraordinary. That stuff must have found the Tardis a bit
indigestible even without the force field on, so it swallowed a bit of the
surrounding matter as well. Hmm. Rather like taking a pill with a swig of
water.  
(Patrick has brought a small device with him.)  
BRIGADIER: Well, we seem to have got rid of it. Benton, you stay here.  
(The Brigadier leaves.)  
BENTON: So you think we've moved, is that it, Doctor?  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, I'm quite sure we have.  
(The Brigadier opens an external door and sees the alien world.)  
BENTON: Well, where do you reckon we are?  
DOCTOR 2: Not where he thinks we are.  
BRIGADIER: Now see here, Doctor, You have finally gone too far.  
DOCTOR 2: I rather think we all have. What's it like out there?  
BRIGADIER: There's, well, there's sand everywhere!  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, splendid. Who's for a swim?  
BRIGADIER: Do you realise what you've done? You've stolen the whole of UNIT
HQ. Now what am I going to tell Geneva? That the whole blessed building has
been picked up and put down on some deserted beach? We're probably miles from
London!  
DOCTOR 2: I'm afraid we're a little bit further than that, Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER: You mean we're not even in the same country? There'll be
international repercussions. This could be construed as an invasion.  
BENTON: It's not just a matter of the same country, sir. If the Doctor's
right, we're not even in the same universe.  
BRIGADIER: What? Oh, nonsense, Benton. I tell you that's a beach out there.
It's probably Norfolk or somewhere like that.  
DOCTOR: Oh, please, if you'd only listen to me.  
BRIGADIER: Right, now I'll tell you what we'll do. You two stay here. See that
nobody wanders in. We can't have the place overrun with holiday makers. I'll
nip out, find a phone and tell the authorities exactly where we are. I'm
fairly sure that's Cromer. Back in a jiff.  
(The Brigadier leaves.)  
DOCTOR 2: Dear oh dear oh dear.  
BENTON: Let's go after him, Doc.  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, I suppose we better had. Just a minute. I think I'll have
another look for my recorder.  
BENTON: Doctor, when are you going to face the facts? You've lost your
recorder and that's that.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, no, I'm sure it's in the Tardis somewhere. I shan't be a minute.  
BENTON: Doctor! Look.  
(A Gel enters the lab.)  
DOCTOR 2: Oh my giddy aunt!

**[Outside the lab]**

(More Gels hem them in.)  
DOCTOR 2: Oh!  
BENTON: Get back. Back.

**[Planet surface]**

(The Brigadier makes his way through the quarry, service pistol at the ready.)  
OLLIS: Hey! Hey, you! Just a minute.  
BRIGADIER: Who are you?  
OLLIS: Ollis, game warden.  
BRIGADIER: Ollis? Yes, of course, the chap who found the balloon then
vanished. Where are we? What's going on here?  
OLLIS: I thought you'd have told me that. They're your manoeuvres.  
BRIGADIER: No, Mister Ollis, I'm as much in the dark as you are. Isn't there
anything you can tell me?  
OLLIS: Well, there were two others in a daffy old motor car for a start. A man
and a girl. They went off after another fellow and all got took by those lumpy
creatures.  
BRIGADIER: What did the man look like?  
OLLIS: Tall, fancy get up, white hair.  
BRIGADIER: But that's. What happened to them?  
OLLIS: I told you! They got took by those things. They didn't get me, though,
because I'm used to moving quiet, stalking them and that.  
BRIGADIER: What, did you follow them?  
OLLIS: I was just coming to that. Look out!  
(They dive for cover and watch as Benton and Patrick are herded along by a
pair of Gels.)  
OLLIS: That's them. That's those things. That's what I meant.  
BRIGADIER: They've got the Doctor and Benton. Come on.  
OLLIS: Hold on now. It's no use rushing them. I know where they're bound.  
(The Gels make their prisoners turn left towards a massive blue-edged opening
in a cliff face and take them inside.)  
OLLIS: Now what, General?  
BRIGADIER: First we do a recce, then we mount a surprise attack. Mister Ollis,
you will consider yourself under my orders.  
(A pair of massive bronze doors close in the cliff face.)

**[Throne room]**

DOCTOR: Look, if you cannot reverse the energy drain, the fabric of the entire
universe could be torn apart.  
OMEGA: What if it is? It will make an interesting spectacle.  
DOCTOR: Then you would be utterly alone forever.  
OMEGA: I am used to solitude. And I shall have had my revenge. I shall be
satisfied.  
DOCTOR: Omega, if you would undo the harm that you've done and resume your
place on the High Council, you could have the freedom to do anything that you
wished.  
OMEGA: Power is the only freedom that I seek.  
(Patrick and Benton are brought in.)  
OMEGA: Absolute power is absolute freedom. No bargains.  
(Benton points at the Jon and gets a kick in the shin to keep quiet.)  
OMEGA: Especially not with those who betrayed and deserted me. No, Doctor, you
are here for a reason. Who are you?  
DOCTOR: Oh, just some more innocent bystanders. Probably scooped up by that
bungling organism of yours. Send them back, Omega. They can do you no harm.  
OMEGA: The organism was programmed to seek out a Time Lord.  
DOCTOR: And it has done so.  
OMEGA: Can this or this also be a Time Lord?  
DOCTOR 2: Appearances aren't everything, you know.  
OMEGA: Ah, you do not fear me. Can it be? Two Time Lords? Ha! The same Time
Lord! The High Council must be desperate indeed to transgress the laws of
time.  
DOCTOR 2: I really think you're making a mistake, you know.  
OMEGA: You have tried to trick me.  
DOCTOR 2: I was out for a stroll with my friend here when this horrible great
jelly  
OMEGA: I might have known the High Council would make some such pathetic
attempt to deceive me.  
DOCTOR: Now, Omega  
OMEGA: Be silent! (thunder roll) While I consider what shall be your fate.  
DOCTOR 2: (sotto) Is it really him? Omega?  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, I'm afraid so.  
OMEGA: You have angered me. You are facing death! Take them away!

**[Planet surface]**

BRIGADIER: Did you find a way in?  
OLLIS: No. You?  
BRIGADIER: No. There's only one thing for it.  
OLLIS: Eh?  
BRIGADIER: Wait till the door opens then take them by storm. A full scale
frontal attack using all the resources available.  
OLLIS: What does that mean?  
BRIGADIER: That, Mister Ollis, means you and me. Come on.

**[Room]**

DOCTOR: I tell you, I practically had him won over then you turned up and he
started treating me like an imposter.  
DOCTOR 2: Well, you are really, aren't you.  
DOCTOR: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR 2: Well, I suppose in another way we both are. Or is it neither of us?  
DOCTOR: Look, for heaven's sake, stop twittering on.  
DOCTOR 2: There's no need to be offensive!  
DOCTOR: I'm not being offensive. The important thing is  
JO: There they go again.  
BENTON: You're supposed to help one another.  
JO: That was the idea.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, all right, I'm sorry. Perhaps I did speak a trifle sharply.  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, well, I'm sorry, too. Well, what did you think of this chap
Omega?  
DOCTOR: Frankly, I thought he was somewhat confused.  
TYLER: Yes, and I'm somewhat confused. Who's he?  
DOCTORS: Me.  
TYLER: I beg your pardon?  
DOCTOR: Oh, ask Jo, there's a good chap. You see, one minute he was talking
about destroying everything  
DOCTOR 2: Yes.  
DOCTOR: The next minute he's talking about freedom.  
TYLER: Look if this is a world of antimatter, how can it all exist?  
DOCTORS: The phenomenon of singularity.  
TYLER: Singularity?  
DOCTOR: Look, you explain to him. You're far better at it than I am.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh, no, no, please. Older and wiser head.  
TYLER: Singularity. Now I know it's supposed to exist  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it does exist. Right here, I'm afraid.  
TYLER: But that's just a theory.  
JO: Oh look, Doctors, what are you talking about? And simple answers, please.
One at a time this time.  
DOCTOR 2: Well, singularity is a point in space time which can exist only
inside a black hole. We are in a black hole, in a world of antimatter very
close to this point of singularity, where all the known physical laws cease to
exist. Now, Omega has got control of singularity and has learned to use the
vast forces locked up inside the black hole.  
DOCTOR: Now, that is how Omega is able to create the world we are now living
in by a fantastic effort of his will, but unfortunately he thinks he's been
wronged by the Time Lords.  
TYLER: Time Lords?  
DOCTOR: Yes, and now he's hell bent on revenge.  
JO: Well, you'll just have to stop him, won't you.  
DOCTOR 2: Well, the trouble is, we're not sure we can.  
BENTON: Well, who is this Omega, anyway?  
DOCTOR: A Time Lord. One of the greatest of all my race.  
DOCTOR 2: Our race.  
DOCTOR: Our race. Yes, sorry.  
DOCTOR 2: Long, long ago, we learnt the secret of time travel, but in order to
make it a reality we had to have a colossal source of energy.  
DOCTOR: Omega provided that energy by a fantastic feat of solar engineering.
We thought he was destroyed, instead of which he finished up here.  
DOCTOR 2: Yes, it seems that his imprisonment was the price of our freedom to
travel in time.  
JO: Even so, you can't let him smash everything up. Well, look, he's not all-
powerful, you know, or else why did he need to bring you here?  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's true.  
BENTON: There must be something you can do to get us out of here?  
JO: What about your sonic screwdriver?  
DOCTOR: No, that's useless in this world. The only natural law here is the law
of Omega's will.  
JO: Omega's will. Look, if Omega can will up an entire world, well surely you
two could will up a small door. Well look, you're a Time Lord, aren't you?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
JO: In fact, you're two Time Lords. Well, surely your wills combined are a
match for his? Why else do you think the High Council wanted the two of you
here?  
DOCTOR: That might work. It just might.  
DOCTOR 2: It's worth a try.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
DOCTOR 2: Right.  
DOCTOR: Right.  
DOCTOR 2: Ready?  
DOCTOR: Ready.  
DOCTOR 2: Contact.  
DOCTOR: Contact.  
(The two Doctors concentrate together and the door starts to fade.)  
JO: It's working.  
(A blue old fashioned door with a knob appears.)  
DOCTOR: Well done.  
DOCTOR 2: I couldn't possibly have done it without you. Well, what next?  
DOCTOR: Now for the singularity chamber. That's the key to it all.  
DOCTOR 2: Splendid. Come on.  
DOCTOR: Come on.  
JO: But you  
DOCTOR: Jo, you wait there.  
DOCTOR 2: It even opens!  
(The two Doctors leave.)  
TYLER: Singularity chamber. Can't miss that. It's the chance of a lifetime!  
(Tyler leaves.)  
JO: That's charming.  
BENTON: I'm not just going to sit here while they have all the fun.  
JO: Neither am I. Come on, Sergeant Benton.  
(Jo and Benton leave just before the door disappears.)

**[Palace]**

(The two Doctors hurry through the passages followed by Jo, Tyler and Benton.
Jo hears something ahead and they look for cover.)  
BENTON: Through here.  
(A Gel glides past.)

**[Throne room]**

The two Doctors sneak into the empty room. Near the throne dais is a doorway
with dry ice pouring out of it.)  
DOCTOR 2: Well, shall we?  
DOCTOR: The bull by the horns, eh?  
DOCTOR 2: All right.  
DOCTOR: Well, after you.  
DOCTOR 2: Let's toss, shall we?  
(Patrick tosses the coin and Jon catches it.)  
DOCTOR: What would be the point?

**[Singularity room]**

(Jon leads the way into the next room, where a raised round well with steps up
to it glows red and has smoke rising from it.)  
DOCTOR: Singularity.  
DOCTOR 2: Fascinating.  
OMEGA: What! How is it that you two are free?  
DOCTOR: By combining our wills against yours.  
DOCTOR 2: Together we were able to break down your barriers, so you're not all
powerful after all, Omega.  
DOCTOR: If you free us, we'll plead your cause to the Time Lords. Otherwise we
shall combine our wills to destroy you.  
OMEGA: You dare threaten to destroy me? You wish to fight the will of Omega?  
DOCTOR: Yes, if I must.  
OMEGA: Then you shall, but you will fight the dark side of my mind. The dark
side of my mind.

**[Palace]**

BENTON: It's no good. It all looks the same.  
TYLER: Well, we can't just stay here.  
JO: They're right behind us.  
BENTON: This way. They're everywhere.  
TYLER: Let's try down here.  
JO: Yes, come on.  
BENTON: It's no good, we're lost.  
TYLER: Well, we can't just give ourselves up.  
BENTON: Agreed. What do we do?  
JO: Let's try this way.  
(Jo picks up the bunch of conjurers flowers she dropped earlier.)  
JO: Hey, look what I found.  
BENTON: Oh great. Well, how can that help us?  
JO: It's the corridor to the main entrance. Come on.

**[Palace doors]**

(Benton starts tugging at the doors.)  
BENTON: Doctor Tyler, give me a hand with this.  
JO: Quickly, they're coming!  
(The Brigadier and Ollis are on the other side. The doors open.)  
BRIGADIER: Out! Make for the hills!  
(The Brigadier fires a couple of shots at approaching Gels as everyone dashes
outside.)

**[Planet surface]**

(The group run through the quarry, just ahead of the Gel's weapons range until
they reach shelter.)  
BENTON: How did you know we were trying to get out?  
BRIGADIER: We didn't. We were trying to get in. Miss Grant, was the Doctor
with you when you came here?  
JO: Yes, of course, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Well he can't have been. He was with me.  
BENTON: Sir, look over there.  
(Gels coming down the path.)  
BRIGADIER: Come on, it's just over the dune.  
JO: What is?  
(Meanwhile, Jon and and a personification of Omega's dark side are having a
slightly slow-motion wrestling match in their heads. They are almost evenly
matched.)

**[Time Control]**

DOCTOR 1 [on monitor]: Well, what do you want now?  
PRESIDENT: Energy levels are dangerously low, Doctor. You are our last chance.
You must go in.  
DOCTOR 1 [on monitor]: In?  
PRESIDENT: The black hole. I repeat, you are our last chance. All three are
needed to defeat Omega. We will use the last of our energy to send you
through.  
DOCTOR 1 [on monitor]: Well, better than being stuck here, I suppose. All
right.

**[In the mind]**

(The mental fight is continuing, and Jon is starting to lose.)  
OMEGA [OC]: Those who oppose the will of Omega shall not live! Destroy him!

__**Episode Four**__

**[In the mind]**

DOCTOR 2 [OC]: No, Omega! Destroy him and you'll destroy your only chance of
freedom.

**[Singularity room]**

(Jon is on the floor, gurning as if someone is throttling him. It stops and
Patrick helps him up.)  
DOCTOR: Thank you, Omega. A most interesting demonstration.  
OMEGA: Be warned. You have seen my power. You and your friends will learn that
it is useless to defy me.  
DOCTOR 2: But our friends do not defy you!  
OMEGA: Oh, yes. They too are trying to escape.

**[Planet surface]**

(The humans have found Bessie. They all clamber in with the Brigadier
driving.)  
JO: Where are we going?  
BRIGADIER: UNIT HQ.  
JO: What?  
BRIGADIER: It's nearer than you think.

**[Singularity room]**

DOCTOR: All this exists because you have willed singularity to create it all
for you.  
OMEGA: Exactly.  
DOCTOR 2: I say, you mean all you've got to do is think of a thing, rub your
magic lamp over there and shally me gally me zoop, there it is? That's jolly
clever. That's jolly clever.  
OMEGA: Are you sure that you and he are of the same intelligence?  
DOCTOR 2: You couldn't run me up a quick recorder, could you? It's a little
thing about this long with holes in. I've lost mine, you see.  
OMEGA: I will tell you of the task that lies before you.  
DOCTOR 2: It's not much to ask, a small recorder!  
OMEGA: Silence!  
DOCTOR: Please, ignore him. Just ignore him. He's incorrigibly frivolous.  
DOCTOR 2: Just because you're not musical!  
DOCTOR: Please! Will you stop interrupting? Continue.  
OMEGA: Continue? (thunder and the palace wobbles) While you play stupid
childish games? You face annihilation, do you know that? You, your entire
race, your precious terrestrials, everything, and what do you do? Huh? You
wrangle and babble of pipes!  
DOCTOR 2: It's not a pipe!  
DOCTOR: (sotto) What the hell do you think you're trying to do?  
DOCTOR 2: (sotto) Testing the limits of his self control. They're not very
good, are they.  
DOCTOR: (sotto) No. No, they're not, but it'll be dangerous if you push him
too far.  
DOCTOR 2: (sotto) We'll have to risk that. That temper is his only weakness.  
OMEGA: What are you saying? Do you plot against me?  
DOCTOR: No, no. I was just explaining to my associate here that he should show
you more respect, for both our sakes.  
DOCTOR 2: I am thoroughly repentant. You mentioned some task.  
OMEGA: Yes. I created this world through the power of my will. I created the
organisms which brought you here. This is the source of the light stream you
travelled along, and I created it. I alone! Omega! And it is not enough. None
of it is enough. I am still trapped. As trapped as I was the moment I arrived
in this, this desolation. Huh. Ironic, is it not?  
DOCTOR 2: But surely, if you can transmit matter to Earth down that light
stream, you could transmit yourself anywhere.  
OMEGA: Yes, so I imagined, but no, there was no way out. No escape.  
DOCTOR: But why?  
OMEGA: So long as I control singularity, I can make it do my will. All these
things exist because I will them to exist. Without me and the unceasing
pressure of my will, the work of thousands of years would collapse into chaos
in microseconds. I am, if you like, the Atlas of my world.  
DOCTOR: So, the moment you abandon control, you cannot escape, and you cannot
escape without abandoning control.  
OMEGA: Exactly. I am a prisoner of my own power, my own creation. Or rather, I
was, until now. And that is your task. To take over my burden so that I may
escape.  
(Bessie is dodging Gel weapons fire as the two Doctors confer.)  
OMEGA: Well? Your answer?  
DOCTOR: We will obey you, Omega.  
DOCTOR 2: We have no choice.  
OMEGA: Then you help me make my preparations. You must first remove this mask.
Now you, too, will need such masks. The light stream has a slow, corrosive
effect, due to the acceleration of the particles, but you are in no immediate
danger. The process takes time. Come, the mask.  
(They slowly lift the face plate of the mask. It creaks on its hinge and they
see the face of Omega.)  
OMEGA: What is it? Why do you not obey me? Take off the mask.  
(Jon pushes the face plate back down.)  
OMEGA: What are you doing? I am in haste to be gone!  
DOCTOR 2: We, we cannot remove the mask, Omega, because.  
DOCTOR: Because beneath that mask there is nothing left of you. The corrosion
has already done its work.  
OMEGA: What?  
(Omega goes to a mirror in the wall and removes the mask completely. We look
straight through him to Jon and Patrick standing behind.)  
DOCTOR: You exist only because your will insists that you exist. Your will is
all that is left of you.  
(Omega puts the mask back on and doubles over, howling.)  
OMEGA: It is not true. I am Omega, creator of this world! And I can also
destroy! Therefore I must exist!  
DOCTOR 2: But don't you see? You can only exist here!  
OMEGA: If I exist only by my will, then my will is to destroy, and all things
shall be destroyed! All things! All things!  
(The palace begins to shake, and the Doctors make their escape.)

**[Palace doors]**

OMEGA [OC]: All things! All things!  
DOCTOR 2: I told you he'd got no self control.  
DOCTOR: Come on, out!

**[Planet surface]**

BENTON: Brigadier, mind that rock!  
TYLER: Watch out!  
OLLIS: Watch it!  
BRIGADIER: There it is, over there.  
JO: How did it get there?  
BRIGADIER: A very good question, Miss Grant. Come on!  
(Meanwhile, elsewhere.)  
DOCTOR: That's funny. I could have sworn I left Bessie here.  
DOCTOR 2: You did, old chap. The tracks are leading that way.  
DOCTOR: That's Jo and Benton.  
DOCTOR 2: They'll be making for UNIT Headquarters.  
DOCTOR: What?  
(Bang - the Gels have caught up to them.)  
DOCTOR: Come on! Let's get a move on.  
(They run off.)

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(Everyone is talking over each other. The Brigadier goes over to the Tardis.)  
BRIGADIER: Locked. Typical. Just one moment, if you please! Now wait a moment.
We may be in a somewhat unusual situation, but you two at least are still
supposed to be members of UNIT.  
JO: Yes, sir.  
BENTON: Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.  
BRIGADIER: The question is this, what offensive action should we or indeed can
we take against this chap Omega? Now in the absence of the Doctors it seems to
me that  
(Boom! Boom!)  
BENTON: Sir, listen!  
BRIGADIER: Sounds like a full scale attack.  
JO: Maybe they're not firing at us. Maybe  
(There is a hammering at the outer door and familiar voices.)  
JO: It's the Doctors!  
BRIGADIER: Benton, open the door, quick!  
JO: Quickly, come on.  
(The Doctors are let in and everyone talks over each other again.)  
DOCTOR 2: Tardis, everybody! Into the Tardis, quickly!  
TYLER: But we can't all get in there!  
DOCTOR: Come on, inside. Come on, Brigadier. Inside, inside!

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Right, force field on.  
DOCTOR 2: Force field's on.

**[Throne room]**

(On his monitor, Omega watches his Gels surround the Tardis.)  
OMEGA: Fools. Do yo think to deny the might of Omega? Soon you will come
crawling to me for mercy, but by that time, your universe will no longer
exist.

**[Time Control]**

(The room is almost dark.)  
PRESIDENT: Well?  
TIME LORD: Energy almost completely exhausted, sir.  
PRESIDENT: And the latest transference?  
TIME LORD: No contact since we tried to pass him through the black hole. The
power level was so low that he may only be able to observe, advise, not to
act.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Well, there you are, then. They can't get in  
DOCTOR 2: And we can't get out.  
DOCTOR: We're besieged.  
JO: Oh, great.  
DOCTOR 2: If only I could find my recorder, I could play you a little
something to pass the time.  
BRIGADIER: We must be thankful for small mercies.  
TYLER: Well, this Tardis of yours is a real marvel, Doctor. I still don't
understand how we all got inside it, but I don't wish to spend the rest of my
life in it.  
JO: True. We can't just stay here for ever.  
BENTON: Come on, Doc. I mean, with two of you there should be twice as many
ideas. Well surely you can think up something to nobble this Omega bloke?  
DOCTOR 2: Nobble him? You're talking about one of the most powerful blokes in
the cosmos. Nobble him?  
(An alarm sounds.)  
DOCTOR: Well, I. Excuse me. Someone's trying to get through to us.  
DOCTOR 2: You don't think? (points up)  
DOCTOR: I hardly think so.  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: There you are, then. What's all this, a mass meeting?  
DOCTOR: Well, we had to bring them all in here. It wasn't safe outside.  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: In a pretty pickle, aren't you. Yes, trapped in your
own Tardis!  
DOCTOR 2: You're trapped in your own bubble. You can talk.  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Unfortunately, talk's all I can do, and not much of
that. The transference isn't stable. Let's get on with it, eh?  
DOCTOR 2: On with what?  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Putting our heads together and finding a solution.
Ready?  
DOCTOR 2: Ready.  
DOCTOR: Ready.  
DOCTOR 2: Contact.  
DOCTOR: Contact.  
(All three Doctors concentrate.)  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: We're all agreed, then. Risky, but it could work. I'll
report back.  
(The image fades.)  
DOCTOR: We'd have to strip down the force field.  
DOCTOR 2: But that'd mean leaving the Tardis defenceless.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, but I think we'll have to risk it.  
DOCTOR 2: It's worth a try. Come on!  
(The two Doctors start working underneath the console.)  
BRIGADIER: What was all that about, Miss Grant?  
JO: Another telepathic conference, I think.  
BRIGADIER: That old chap?  
JO: Afraid so.  
BRIGADIER: Three of them. I didn't know when I was well off. Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Yes, what is it?  
BRIGADIER: Would you mind telling us laymen what you scientists are getting so
excited about?  
DOCTOR: We think we've found a way of dealing with Omega.  
TYLER: Mind telling me how?  
DOCTOR: Later, old chap. If there's still time.  
TYLER: Oh, splendid.  
DOCTOR: How do we know that he'll take the generator? What if he should
refuse?  
DOCTOR 2: Ah, I've found it.  
DOCTOR: Found what?  
DOCTOR: My recorder. It must have been there all the time.  
(The recorder is part of a module in the console stand.)  
DOCTOR 2: Right in the corner of the force field.  
DOCTOR: Well, don't touch it.  
DOCTOR 2: I wasn't going to.  
DOCTOR: Don't you understand? It's exactly what we want. Far better than the
force field generator.  
DOCTOR 2: Oh no, not my recorder!  
DOCTOR: I'll get you another one. I'll get you a hundred, I'll get you a
thousand of them. Come on.

**[Time control]**

TIME LORD: I've got a contact, sir.  
PRESIDENT: Oh?  
TIME LORD: The Doctor.  
PRESIDENT: Did you find them? Did you make contact?  
DOCTOR 1 [on monitor]: For a while.  
PRESIDENT: Is there any chance? We can't hold out much longer. What's
happening?  
DOCTOR 1 [on monitor]: There's a possible solution. I'll let you know as soon
as I can.

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctors remove the module with the recorder wired up in the middle.)  
DOCTOR 2: Here we are, then. This should do the trick.  
BRIGADIER: I suppose it would be too much to ask for someone to tell us what
all this means.  
DOCTOR: It means, Brigadier, that we can now strike a bargain with our friend
Omega.  
BRIGADIER: With that box of tricks there?  
JO: And a flute?  
DOCTOR: This box of tricks, as you call it, is a kind of portable force field.  
DOCTOR 2: And the recorder is considerably more than just a recorder.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Right, ready?  
(Patrick hands the device to Tyler.)  
DOCTOR 2: Here, if you'd just hold this.  
TYLER: Oh, splendid. Yes.  
DOCTOR: Right, switch on.  
DOCTOR 2: On.  
(Jon goes over to the scanner.)  
DOCTOR: Omega, we want to talk with you.  
OMEGA [on scanner]: I hear you, brother Time Lords.  
DOCTOR: We think we have discovered a way to give you back your freedom. Will
you now free the Tardis so that we can come to you?  
OMEGA [on scanner]: Is this some deceit? You cannot escape my world unless I
will it.  
DOCTOR 2: No, not a bit of it, old chap. We just want to avoid a long, tiring
walk, that's all.  
OMEGA [on scanner]: Very well. Come to me you shall!  
DOCTOR: Right. Now listen to me, everybody. From now on you are to do exactly
as you are told.  
JO: Why? What's going to happen?  
DOCTOR: Now, Jo, please do as I ask. Do exactly as I tell you. Do you promise?  
JO: All right, I promise.  
DOCTOR: Good. Are you ready? Stand by. Here we go.  
(Tyler gives Patrick the device back. The Tardis dematerialises from the lab.)

**[Singularity room]**

(Jon leads everyone out of the Tardis.)  
OMEGA: Do you think this trickery will save you for long?  
DOCTOR: We have come to set you free.  
OMEGA: What is this?  
DOCTOR: On one condition.  
OMEGA: I make the terms, Time Lords!  
DOCTOR: Omega, if you will send these people back to where they came from, we
will stay and help you.  
(Benton restrains Jo from protesting.)  
DOCTOR: We think we have devised a way of restoring your freedom to you.  
OMEGA: What way? I know now that you cannot give me my freedom, but you can
keep me company in the endless empty years that lie ahead. If you will both
stay here willingly and share my exile, then I will spare your friends and
their universe.  
DOCTOR: We shall give you that promise, Omega. We will not attempt to leave
this world before you do.  
JO: You can't!  
DOCTOR Jo! You promised!  
OMEGA: Go, then, back to your planet. Be gone, and give thanks that Omega is
merciful.  
(Omega leaves.)  
BRIGADIER: Doctor, what shall we do?  
DOCTOR: Brigadier, I want all of you to step through that column of smoke.  
BRIGADIER: What?  
DOCTOR: Don't be alarmed. It won't harm you. On the contrary, it will take you
back home.  
DOCTOR 2: Please, Brigadier, it's the only way.  
BRIGADIER: Well, I don't know what you're up to, but all right. Now, Mister
Ollis?  
OLLIS: Not me. I'm not going in there.  
BRIGADIER: Doctor Tyler?  
(Tyler walks up the steps to the well.)  
TYLER: Are you sure it's all right?  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I'm sure.  
(Tyler steps over the well, and disappears in the smoke from the singularity.)  
BRIGADIER: Now then, Mister Ollis.  
(Ollis walks through.)  
BRIGADIER: Sergeant Benton.  
(Benton walks up to the well.)  
BENTON: I'd sooner Miss Grant.  
BRIGADIER: Move, Benton.  
(Benton walks through.)  
BRIGADIER: Now then, Miss Grant.  
JO: No! No, I want to stay with the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Jo, please.  
BRIGADIER: Come on, Jo.  
DOCTOR: Trust me.  
(Jo takes the Brigadier's hand and walks up the steps.)  
DOCTOR: You'll be all right.  
(Jo steps into the smoke.)  
BRIGADIER: Goodbye, Doctor. Doctors.  
(The Brigadier walks up the steps, turns and salutes then briskly walks into
the smoke and vanishes.)  
OMEGA: So, brother Time Lords, I have played your game. Now it is your turn to
play mine, and there can be no escape for any of us!  
(Pat fetches the device from the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR 2: You are wrong, Omega. You can have your freedom. It is here.  
OMEGA: What is this childish contraption?  
DOCTOR 2: The only freedom you can ever have. Take it. Take it, Omega.  
(The two Doctors close their eyes and concentrate. Omega laughs.)  
DOCTOR: Take it!  
OMEGA: Commands? You command me? This is my world! I command! And you pester
me with trinkets!  
(Omega knocks the device to the floor.)  
DOCTOR 2: Run!  
DOCTOR: Come on, quick!  
The portable force field fizzles, and a new star flares in the middle of the
black hole.)

**[Time Control]**

(The black hole on the monitor disappears as it is replaced by the new star,
and the lights come back on.)  
PRESIDENT: Another source of energy. Once again, Omega.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(Everyone falls out of the air and lands on their feet. The room is back in
one piece.)  
BENTON: We're back!  
TYLER: Well, we certainly seem to be.  
(Benton looks out of the window.)  
BENTON: But we're really back.  
JO: But the Doctors.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, I dare say they'll turn up as usual.  
(Jo falls into Benton's arms, sobbing.)  
BRIGADIER: Wonderful chap, both of him.  
(A blue police box suddenly appears.)  
JO: The Tardis!  
DOCTOR: I told you he had no self-control, didn't I?  
JO: Doctor!  
TYLER: How did you manage it?  
DOCTOR 2: By the skin of our teeth.  
TYLER: Splendid.  
DOCTOR 2: Where's Mister Ollis?  
TYLER: What?  
DOCTOR 2: Where's Mister Ollis?  
DOCTOR: Oh, back where he came from, I imagine.  
(Ollis lands on his feet by the lake side.)  
DOCTOR: So there you are. Omega's will was like the tension in the elastic.
Once that will was broken, all the bits of Earth, UNIT etc just snapped back
right into their proper place.  
BENTON: But how come you turned up in the Tardis?  
DOCTOR 2: Because that was the proper place for us.  
JO: What was all that business about the flute?  
DOCTOR 2: Well, as you know, it accidentally fell into the force field of the
Tardis, so that when we were all transformed into antimatter, that was the
only thing that wasn't processed.  
DOCTOR: And when Omega knocked it out of our hands and it fell out of the
force field, all the atoms and the anti-atoms annihilated one another.  
TYLER: So, big bang, and the black hole becomes a supernova!  
DOCTOR: Exactly.  
DOCTOR 2: Pity, though. I think it had a lovely tone.  
DOCTOR 1 [OC]: Everything okay?

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Well, here we are, back safe and sound.  
DOCTOR 2: Quite a party.  
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Yes, well, the party's over now. You young men and I go
back to our time zones. Though considering the way things have been going,
well, I shudder to think what you'll do with out me.  
(William's picture fades for the last time.)  
DOCTOR 2: Goodbye. Well, goodbye, everybody. Goodbye. It's been so nice to
meet me.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I see what you mean. I hope I don't meet me again.  
DOCTOR 2: Ah.  
(Patrick takes a step back, and waves as he disappears.)  
TYLER: Now I've seen it all.  
JO: Pity. He was so sweet.  
DOCTOR: Yes, wasn't I?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, as far as I'm concerned, Doctor, one of you is enough.
More than enough. Sergeant Benton!  
BENTON: Sir?  
BRIGADIER: You and I'd better make a full inventory of the HQ. Make sure
everything's back in place. It's all got to be accounted for, you know.  
BENTON: Sir?  
BRIGADIER: Yes?  
BENTON: Well, excuse me, sir, but, well, if anything is missing, where do we
say it's gone?  
BRIGADIER: Come along, Benton.  
(The Brigadier and Benton leave.)  
TYLER: Well, I think I'd better be on my way, too. Thank you for a fascinating
trip, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Goodbye.  
TYLER: Goodbye. Goodbye, Jo.  
JO: Goodbye.  
TYLER: I don't think I'll write it up in the University journal, not if I want
to keep my job.  
(Tyler leaves.)  
JO: What's the matter, Doctor? Everything worked out all right, didn't it?  
DOCTOR: Yes, for us.  
JO: I know what it is. It's because you had to trick Omega.  
DOCTOR: I didn't exactly trick him. I promised him his freedom and I gave it
to him. The only freedom he could ever have.  
JO: What else could you do? It was either him or everything.  
(There is a materialisation sound, and a caltrop shaped circuit appears on the
time rotor.)  
DOCTOR: The Time Lords! Look, they've sent me a new dematerialisation circuit.
And my knowledge of time travel law and all the dematerialisation codes,
they've all come back. They've forgiven me. They've given me back my freedom.  
JO: I suppose you'll be rushing off, then.  
DOCTOR: No, not straight away, Jo. Of course not. I've got to build a new
force field generator first.

**[Outside the Lodge]**

MRS OLLIS: And where do you think you've been, Arthur Ollis? I've been worried
sick about you, I have. Everybody's been searching. Where have you been?
Soldiers looking for you. You didn't come home for your dinner. Well?  
OLLIS: You'd never believe me, woman. Supper ready?
