**Planet of the Spiders**  
  
Original Airdate: 4 May, 1974  

__**Part One**__

(Mike Yates, former Captain with UNIT, strolls along by a field of cows.)

**[Theatre]**

(It's cabaret time, but the Doctor and Brigadier don't appear to be having as
much fun as the rest of the audience.)  
COMEDIAN [OC]: Here's a funny thing. Here's a funny thing. When Archimedes,
you've heard of Archimedes, jumped out of his bath and ran down the road
without his clothes on, he didn't shout Eureka, he shouted I'm a streaker!  
(Groans all round the room.)  
BRIGADIER: Look here, Doctor, this is a complete waste of time.  
HOST [OC]: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the management takes great pleasure
in presenting to you that exotic Turkish delight of the east, Sherezadi!  
(This is not the act the Doctor was waiting for.)

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

(Yates has arrived at a red-brick building - Tidmarsh Manor - in the middle of
nowhere and gone inside. He wanders along a corridor and opens a door.
Somewhere downstairs, people are chanting to cymbal accompaniment. He goes
down the staircase and listens.)  
ALL [OC]: Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om.

**[** **Cellar]**

(An ornate circular mandala design is on the floor, and five men are sitting
cross-legged around it.)  
ALL: Om.  
LUPTON: Om mani  
ALL: Om.  
LUPTON: padme hum.  
ALL: Om.  
LUPTON: Om mani  
ALL: Om.  
LUPTON: padme hum.  
ALL: Om.  
LUPTON: Om mani  
ALL: Om.  
LUPTON: padme hum.  
ALL: Om.  
LUPTON: Om mani  
ALL: Om.  
LUPTON: padme hum.  
ALL: Om.  
LUPTON: Om mani  
ALL: Om.  
LUPTON: padme hum.  
(And so on. If I keep typing that up we'll be here all day. It is henceforth
referred to as the chant. Mike peers around the out cellar door then quietly
goes in as the chanting becomes more forceful, building up to something. A
turquoise glow appears in the middle of the mandala. Moving forward, Mike
walks into a spider's web. He recoils and knocks a candlestick, then back up
the stairs. The sound of his footsteps breaks the chant.

**[Theatre]**

(The Brigadier liked the belly dancer.)  
DOCTOR: Well, you enjoyed that.  
BRIGADIER: Extraordinary muscular control. Very fit, that girl. I must adapt
some of those movements as exercises for the men.  
DOCTOR: They'd take some adapting.  
HOST [OC]: And now, ladies and gentlemen, a slight contrast. That mind reader
extraordinaire, Professor Herbert Clegg!  
DOCTOR: This is what we came for.  
BRIGADIER: And about time.

**[** **Cellar]**

BARNES: Shall we carry on?  
LUPTON: No, no, no, no. It's too late now. We'll try again tomorrow. Are you
sure you saw nothing?  
BARNES: Oh, it was the wind. Someone left the door open.  
LUPTON: Listen.  
BARNES: It's a car.  
(The exhaust note recedes into the distance.)  
LUPTON: Well, there's only one car here. The car belonging to our new friend,
Mister Yates.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(The Brigadier escorts in a bearded man in cape and fedora.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, Professor Clegg. How good of you to come.  
CLEGG: To be honest, I'm not quite sure why I have come. Your message was
somewhat ambiguous.  
DOCTOR: Yes, It's my fault entirely. I do apologise. Won't you sit down?  
CLEGG: Thank you. You, er, you want me to do my act for you? Some sort of
regimental guest night, is it? Cabaret? I do a lot of dinners.  
BRIGADIER: Lord, no. But clever stuff, mind you, but not really my cup of tea.  
CLEGG: Oh, then, er, what exactly is it you want of me, gentlemen?  
DOCTOR: Well, you see, Professor, I'm doing a little research into ESP.  
BRIGADIER: That's extra sensory perception, you know.  
CLEGG: Ah, yes, as a matter of actual fact, I did know that.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, really? Well, I can't say that I did until the Doctor explained
this morning.  
DOCTOR: You see, Professor, my particular field covers, er, psycholotry,
telepathy and clairvoyance as well, so I thought perhaps you might be able to
help me.  
CLEGG: Oh. Well, you see, I'm afraid I can't, dearly as I'd like to.  
DOCTOR: You disappoint me, Professor.  
CLEGG: Well, there you are, that's just it. I'm, er. Well, I'm not a professor
at all. That's just for, er, well, you know, professional purposes, do you
see?  
BRIGADIER: You're trying to tell us that it was all a lot of tricks.  
CLEGG: Well, er, not to put too fine a point on it, yes.  
DOCTOR: Just a word code with your assistant, eh?  
CLEGG: Ah. Very perspicacious of you, Doctor. I feel sure that my secret is
safe with you.  
DOCTOR: Oh, indeed it is, Professor. Indeed it is.  
CLEGG: Thank you.  
DOCTOR: I assure you that I shall tell nobody that you are really a very
powerful clairvoyant.  
CLEGG: I beg your pardon?  
DOCTOR: That's your real secret, isn't it?  
CLEGG: Why ever should you think that?  
DOCTOR: You made a couple of mistakes last night, Professor. You gave the
answer before your assistant had uttered a word.  
CLEGG: Oh. It's happening more and more. I don't want it to! I was quite happy
as a performer, Doctor, but I seem to be developing this, this power! Oh, I
hate it. I hate it. The things I can make happen.  
DOCTOR: Physical manifestations? Psychokinesis, for example?  
CLEGG: Well, yes.  
DOCTOR: That's remarkable.  
BRIGADIER: Would you mind explaining?  
CLEGG: Psychokinesis? Moving things by the power of the mind.  
DOCTOR: A very rarely developed faculty in homo sapiens. Professor? Mister
Clegg. Would you give us a demonstration?  
CLEGG: Well, er.  
DOCTOR: Please?  
CLEGG: Oh, very well.  
(Clegg concentrates on a tray over on a desk, with a plate and plastic cup on
it. Gently, it rises into the air and moves towards him.)  
CLEGG: I can't, I can't keep it up.  
(The tray clatters to the floor at the Brigadier's feet.)  
BRIGADIER: You ought to use that in your act.  
CLEGG: And lose my sanity? It would be a poor exchange.  
DOCTOR: Mister Clegg, your powers may seem to be extraordinary, but I assure
you that they lie dormant in everyone. They're perfectly natural.  
CLEGG: I find that very difficult to believe.  
DOCTOR: But that's what my experiment's are all about, Mister Clegg.  
CLEGG: You mean, you mean you can find out why I'm different?  
DOCTOR: Possibly.  
CLEGG: Then I. Very well, I'll help you all I can.  
DOCTOR: Good.

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

(Lupton follows an oriental man down the main staircase.)  
LUPTON: Not only a journalist, but a woman journalist. We do not want her
here.  
CHO-JE: We cannot shut out the world entirely, my brother.  
LUPTON: Why not? You used to, in Tibet.  
CHO-JE: All things pass away, as you will learn in your meditation. This world
of samsara, the world of appearance, is the world of change.  
LUPTON: Yes, but

**[Sitting room]**

LUPTON: I came here to get away from the world. So did the others. We came
here to find solitude.  
CHO-JE: One day you will learn to walk in solitude amidst the traffic of the
world.  
LUPTON: It's still not too late to stop her coming.  
CHO-JE: But it is. Mister Yates has already gone to the station to fetch her.  
(Cho-Je spins a prayer wheel and goes through an inner door.)

**[Mortimer Railway Station]**

(Mike has met Sarah off the train at Stratfield Mortimer, and they get into
his sporty little open top two seater.)  
SARAH: What's it all about?  
(He just drives them away.)

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

LUPTON: Of course it's no accident. We heard his car last night, didn't we?
He's bringing her here because he suspects something.  
BARNES: We'll just have to stop for a while, that's all.  
LUPTON: Stop? Now? On the point of breakthrough? The power in that circle last
night  
TOMMY: Hello, Lupton.  
(A man in a woollen jumper is holding out a flower.)  
TOMMY: Look.  
LUPTON: Mister Lupton.  
TOMMY: Huh? Yeah. Mister. Look. Pretty.  
BARNES: Go and get on with your work, Tommy. You're not wanted here.  
TOMMY: Finished weeding. Look, Barnes. Pretty flower.  
BARNES: Yes, I can see. Now go and find something else to do, will you?  
TOMMY: Going to have a cuppa. Er, you like a cuppa? Er, you like a cuppa,
mister?  
BARNES: For pity's sake!  
(Barnes pushes Tommy away, and he falls backwards onto the carpet.)  
LUPTON: Get the others together. There's no time to be lost.  
(Lupton and Barnes leave. Tommy discovers that he has crushed his flower when
he fell.)  
TOMMY: Pretty flower. Poor pretty.

**[Road]**

(Driving along.)  
SARAH: It's a nice day.  
MIKE: Yes, isn't it.  
SARAH: Oh, come on, Mike. Out with it.  
MIKE: Hmm?  
SARAH: What is it all about?  
MIKE: I told you. It's a great story for that magazine of yours.  
SARAH: A couple of refugee Tibetan monks setting up a lamasery in darkest
mummerset?  
MIKE: It's not a lamasery. It's a meditation centre.  
SARAH: Okay, so maybe meditation's the in-thing. Maybe I can sell it to Percy.
I still want to know what it's all about. Look, you'd better start at the
beginning. I mean, what are you doing here anyway?  
MIKE: Trying to sort myself out, I suppose, after that golden age mess.  
SARAH: Ah.  
MIKE: I mean, like you said, everybody's going on about meditation of one sort
or another, so I thought I'd have a crack at it. Then I saw in the paper about
these two Tibetans.  
(The group are back around the mandala doing the Om Mani padme hum chant
again.)  
SARAH: Well, it sounds to me as if these people are just getting on with their
meditation. You know, doing a bit of homework.  
MIKE: Then why be so secret about it? No, they're up to something. I think
they're in touch with some. Oh, I don't know, some power. It's definitely a
job for UNIT.  
SARAH: Well, then, you must tell the Brig or the Doctor.  
MIKE: And you think they'd believe me? Last time we met I pulled a gun on
them.  
SARAH: Oh, now I get it!  
(The chanting builds up to a peak, and we zoom in on Lupton.)  
SARAH: So, you want me to have a look round and then tell the Brig for you?  
MIKE: That's the general idea.  
SARAH: Hmm.  
MIKE: Please?  
SARAH: Okay.  
MIKE: Bless you, Sarah Jane.  
SARAH: You'll have to convince me though.  
MIKE: Don't you worry.  
(There is a tractor dead ahead. Mike slams on the brakes as Sarah puts up her
arms to shield her face. They swerve off the road, which is now completely
empty.)  
MIKE: There's nothing there.  
SARAH: So you did see it?  
MIKE: The tractor? Of course.  
SARAH: I'm convinced.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(The Doctor is wiring up a pair of oversized headphones that Clegg is wearing
to a monitor.)  
DOCTOR: You see, Brigadier, the electrocephalograph will show us his
brainwaves on here as we carry out the tests. Right, let's try a little simple
psycholotry, shall we? Er, Lethbridge Stewart, my dear fellow, would you like
to give Mister Clegg some little article of yours?  
BRIGADIER: What? Oh. Yes, yes, rather.  
(The Brigadier takes off his wrist watch.)  
BRIGADIER: Here.  
DOCTOR: Right. Ready when you are, Mister Clegg.  
CLEGG: This watch was given to you eleven years ago. You received it in a
hotel. A hotel by the sea. Brighton, was it? From a young lady called Doris.
She said it was to mark her gratitude to you  
BRIGADIER: Yes, all true, absolutely spot on.  
(The Brigadier takes back his watch rather quickly.)  
BRIGADIER: Surely you've got enough, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: A little too much perhaps, eh, Alastair?  
(The Doctor moves a large modified salon hairdryer over Clegg's head.)  
DOCTOR: Right, this is what we call the IRIS machine, or Image Reproduction
Integrating System. It translates your thoughts into pictures on this monitor
here. Try this, will you?  
(The Doctor hands Clegg his sonic screwdriver. As he handles it, the screen
shows one Drashig, then three, then the Doctor using the screwdriver to ignite
the marsh gas to kill them.)

**[Sitting room]**

(Sarah is taking down shorthand as Mike sits in on the interview.)  
CHO-JE: We can but point a finger along the way. A man must go inside and face
his fears and hopes, his hates and his loves, and watch them wither away. Then
he will find his true self, which is no self. He will see his true mind, which
is no mind.  
SARAH: And that's what meditation's all about?  
CHO-JE: Yes! The old man must die and the new man will discover to his
inexpressible joy that he has never existed.  
SARAH: Well, good luck, mate.  
MIKE: I think I'm going to need it.  
SARAH: But if you do start ferreting about in your subconscious, aren't you
going to turn up all sorts of nasties? I mean, complexes, phobias and what
have you?  
CHO-JE: Of course, the demons and the divinities. But in our way, the
Vajrayana Way, we use the powers to help us. If we will excuse me, it's time
for the meditation class.  
MIKE: But couldn't that be dangerous? If these, these powers were used
wrongly.  
CHO-JE: It could be so, yes. By evil men in their ignorance and craving, it
could indeed be most dangerous.  
MIKE: I see.  
CHO-JE: Such a thing could never happen here.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

CLEGG: I'm sorry. I, I saw, well, just fantasies.  
BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Professor. You're doing very well.  
DOCTOR: Indeed you are, Professor. Indeed you are.  
(The Doctor takes back his screwdriver.)  
DOCTOR: Now, er, do you feel up to bending the odd fork?  
(Benton enters with a package.)  
BENTON: Doctor, I. Ah, doing a bit of hairdressing on the side, eh?  
BRIGADIER: Benton.  
BENTON: Sorry, sir. I didn't see you there.  
BRIGADIER: What do you want?  
BENTON: Well, this package, sir. It's just arrived by express post. I thought
it may be urgent.  
BRIGADIER: Well, for the Doctor or for me?  
BENTON: Well, that's just it. It's addressed to the Doctor or Brigadier
Lethbridge Stewart or Captain Yates or, er, Sergeant Benton. It's from South
America, sir.  
DOCTOR: What, from Jo?  
BENTON: I reckon so.  
DOCTOR: Well, let's take a look.  
(The Doctor is about to open the package when he stops.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, no, wait a minute. I've got a better idea. Er, Mister Clegg, would
you like to tell us what's inside this package?  
CLEGG: This has come a long way.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, of course, from the Amazon. Sergeant Benton just told you.  
DOCTOR: Brigadier, please.  
CLEGG: From beyond the stars. Could it be a meteorite? Oh, it's beautiful. A
gemstone. A blue jewel.  
BRIGADIER: Lord, not that stone of yours?  
DOCTOR: The crystal from Metebelis Three. Thank you, Mister Clegg. Let's take
a look, shall we?  
(The Doctor opens the package and takes out the large stone.)  
DOCTOR: Well, well, well.

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

(Mike has given Sarah the tour and ended up outside a door marked Meditation
Room.)  
MIKE: And that that's about it.  
SARAH: Where is everybody, though?  
MIKE: In there, most of them.  
SARAH: Well, that's more like it. Can I have a look?  
MIKE: Well, I don't think.  
SARAH: Now, that sweet little lama said to show me everything, didn't he?  
MIKE: Yes, but he didn't mean you to  
SARAH: Well, come on then.  
MIKE: All right, but for heaven's sake be quiet.  
SARAH: Shush.

**[Meditation room]**

(A different chant is going on here as the students sit cross-legged in two
rows facing each other. The sound is coming from a reel to reel tape recorder.
Mike and Sarah watch from the doorway.)  
MIKE: (sotto) It helps with the meditation.  
SARAH: (sotto) What are they meditating about?  
MIKE: (sotto) Not about anything. They're just meditating, watching.  
SARAH: (sotto) So what are they watching?  
MIKE: (sotto) They're mentally watching their tummies go up and down as they
breathe.  
SARAH: (sotto) Like contemplating their belly buttons.  
MIKE: (sotto) You could put it like that. Come on.

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

SARAH: Well, I hope you all know what you're on about.  
MIKE: It probably seems a bit daft.  
SARAH: Oh.  
MIKE: It's an exercise in awareness, really. Hey, come on. It's time we hid in
the cellar.  
SARAH: Oh! Right.  
(Mike and Sarah walk around a corner.)  
LUPTON: Good afternoon, my brother.  
(Barnes is standing behind Lupton.)  
MIKE: Good afternoon.  
SARAH: Ahem.  
MIKE: Oh, this is Sarah Jane Smith. She works for Metropolitan. You know, the
magazine.  
LUPTON: Yes, I know. Cho-Je mentioned that you would be coming.  
MIKE: Did he? When?  
LUPTON: This afternoon. I trust you had an informative visit?  
SARAH: Oh, er, yes. Yes, thank you. Most pleasant. Well, after a bad start,
that is.  
LUPTON: A bad start?  
SARAH: Yes, well, Mike and I were driving down the road  
MIKE: Oh, we had a little accident.  
SARAH: Accident?  
(Mike pinches Sarah's arm.)  
SARAH: Ah.  
MIKE: The car ran off the road.  
LUPTON: You were lucky to escape. The roads round here can be very dangerous.
Very dangerous indeed.  
MIKE: I take your point.  
LUPTON: Good. You must stay and share our meal with us.  
SARAH: Oh, great.  
MIKE: I'm afraid there won't be time.  
LUPTON: Well, at least have a cup of tea.  
SARAH: Oh, now you're talking.  
MIKE: Er, no. Unfortunately Miss Smith has to leave right away.  
SARAH: But I  
MIKE: If you don't go now you'll miss your train.  
(Mike drags Sarah along the corridor.)  
SARAH: We've got hours yet.  
MIKE: I think you must have mis-read your timetable.  
SARAH: Oh. Excuse me.

**[Outside the Spiritual Retreat]**

(They go over to Mike's car and get in.)  
SARAH: Look, I just don't understand you. You said you want me to see for
myself and then you suddenly take off.

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

LUPTON: I don't think we shall have any more trouble. That young man's scared
out of his wits. Warn the others. We carry on as planned.

**[Mike's car]**

SARAH: Look, what's it all about?  
MIKE: That was Lupton.  
SARAH: Well. Oh, so that's why you pinched me. I'll be bruised for a week.  
MIKE: You heard what he said. He'd been told you were coming.  
SARAH: So?  
MIKE: Well don't you see? He must have been responsible for that
hallucination, that non-existent tractor. He tried to kill us.  
(Mike stops the car just outside the Lamasery grounds.)  
SARAH: So why are we running away?  
MIKE: We're not. We're letting him think we're running away. Now we'll go back
on foot.  
SARAH: The fiendish cunning of the man.  
(They climb over the wall a short way from the main gate.)

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(The Doctor is reading Jo's letter.)  
DOCTOR: And we're at our twenty eighth native village. No, hang about, twenty
ninth. Switch on the light for me, Sergeant, will you?  
BENTON: All right.  
DOCTOR: We haven't found our toadstool yet, and we're not likely to if I don't
get rid of this crystal. You see, the Indian porters say it's bad magic. Like
it goes or they go. So, Doctor, if you're away on a cheap day trip to Mars,
perhaps you could look after it for me, Brigadier? Or if you're away in
Geneva, how about it, Mike? Or my lovely Sergeant Benton? (Clegg has picked up
the crystal.)  
DOCTOR: I must say I miss you all very much.

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

(Mike and Sarah climb in through a window.)  
SARAH: (sotto) Thanks.  
TOMMY: Why are you climbing in the window?  
MIKE: Er, yes, yes, I  
TOMMY: Play games?  
MIKE: That's right, just playing a little game.  
TOMMY: Tom likes games. Tom play game too? SARAH: Er, tell you what, Tom.  
TOMMY: Who are you?  
SARAH: My name is Sarah. Sarah Jane Smith.  
TOMMY: Tom likes you, Sarah Jane Smith.  
SARAH: Oh, you see, Tom, this game, it's called secrets. And its a secret that
I'm here. Shush.  
TOMMY: Shush.  
SARAH: Yeah. So you won't tell anyone, will you?  
TOMMY: Ah, that's pretty.  
SARAH: Would you like it?  
(Sarah takes off her silver brooch.)  
SARAH: Here. Careful not to prick yourself.  
TOMMY: Oh, it's pretty.  
(Tommy leaves.)  
MIKE: (sotto) A shameless display of feminine wiles. Come on.  
SARAH: (sotto) Nonsense.  
MIKE: (sotto) Shush.  
(Mike opens the door to the cellars.)

**[** **Cellar]**

(There is no one here.)  
MIKE: (sotto) They must be just about to start. Let's find somewhere to hide.  
(There are voices outside.)  
SARAH: (sotto) Listen.  
MIKE: (sotto) Hide behind here, quick.  
(Sarah walks into a spider's web and gives off muffled squeals.)  
MIKE: Shush.  
(The cabal enter, sit quickly and start the chanting.)

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(The Doctor is still reading Jo's letter. Clegg is still gazing at the
Metebelis crystal, which is starting to glow blue.)  
DOCTOR: And the coffee's just about as filthy as UNIT tea, if that's possible.
I must go now, or I'll miss the next cleft-stick to civilisation.  
(The letter suddenly flies out of the Doctor's hands and the whole place
shakes. Glassware falls off shelves and pieces of paper fly around. Lupton and
his cabal continue their chanting. The Doctor fights against an unseen force
or wind to try and reach Clegg and the crystal. He manages to grab it from the
clairvoyant's hand. Clegg cries out in pain then stops dead.)  
BRIGADIER: I'll get the M.O.  
DOCTOR: You're too late, Brigadier. He's dead.

**[** **Cellar]**

(The chanting reaches a peak and the mandala starts to glow. Then a very big
spider appears in the middle of it.)

__**Part Two**__

**[** **Cellar]**

(The room goes quiet. The cabal jump to their feet and one of them, Keaver,
starts to run for the door. The spider zaps him with a bolt of energy.)  
LUPTON: Go. I command you, go.  
(The giant spider speaks with a female-pitch voice.)  
SPIDER: I have come to give you the power you seek.  
LUPTON: Power?  
SPIDER: Turn around. Turn around, I say.  
(Lupton obeys. The spider prepares itself then leaps onto his back and
vanishes into him. Lupton turns around, smiling.)

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

BRIGADIER: Well, what did the man die of? Did the crystal kill him?  
DOCTOR: No, I don't see how it could have done.  
BRIGADIER: Well, he was looking at it when he died.  
(Benton enters.)  
BENTON: The police have gone, sir. The Inspector said he'd give you a ring
later.  
BRIGADIER: Right. Thank you, Benton.  
DOCTOR: Wait a minute. Now there is a chance.  
BRIGADIER: A chance of what?  
DOCTOR: Well, Professor Clegg was attached to this IRIS machine when he died.
Perhaps it recorded his thoughts.  
(The Doctor rewinds a tape then switches on the monitor. The image is an
arachnophobe's worst nightmare.)  
BRIGADIER: Spiders?

**[** **Cellar]**

KEAVER: What happened? That spider! Where is it?  
LUPTON: Now, go to your rooms. But remember, not a word of this to a living
soul. Go on.  
(The three men leave.)  
BARNES: Lupton, are you feeling all right?  
LUPTON: Of course I am. Never felt better.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

DOCTOR: Well, there's only one thing to do now.  
BENTON: Well, what's that, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I must look into the crystal myself.  
BRIGADIER: Isn't that rather dangerous? I mean, look what happened last time.  
DOCTOR: I'll bear it in mind, Brigadier.  
BENTON: Er, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
BENTON: Well, wouldn't it be best for me to have a go first? I mean, I'm
expendable and you're not.  
DOCTOR: Well, I'm already responsible for the death of one man, Sergeant.
Thanks just the same.

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

(Sarah is halfway out of the window.)  
SARAH: (sotto) Look, you're sure you won't come too?  
MIKE: (sotto) If I went they'd guess I was onto them. No, it's much better you
go by yourself. Let the Doc and the Brig know what's going on.  
SARAH: (sotto) Okay. Hey, Mike?  
MIKE: (sotto) What?  
SARAH: (sotto) I don't know what is going on.  
MIKE: (sotto) Just tell them everything you saw. Off you go.  
SARAH: (sotto) Well, what are you going to do?  
MIKE: (sotto) I'm going to try and get into the Abbot, tell him all about it.  
SARAH: (sotto) Do be careful.  
(Sarah leaves and Mike closes the window then draws the curtains.)  
LUPTON [OC]: This is only the first stage, do you see?  
BARNES [OC]: I still don't understand what happened.  
(Mike leaves.)  
LUPTON: I'm only just beginning to understand myself.  
BARNES: And, that spider, what was it? One of those Tibetan demons Cho-je
warned us about?  
LUPTON: Well, that's what he would say, but he'd be wrong.  
BARNES: Where did it go?  
LUPTON: It didn't. It's still here.  
BARNES: Still there? Do you mean you can still feel it on your back?  
LUPTON: Our minds are joined together. If I concentrate I can hear it speaking
to me.  
SPIDER [OC]: This man is stupid. Send him away.  
LUPTON: Very well.  
BARNES: Was it speaking to you then?  
LUPTON: It was.  
BARNES: What did it say?  
LUPTON: It said you looked tired and you should be in bed.  
BARNES: I'll never be able to sleep a wink. To think I came here to get peace
of mind.  
LUPTON: Look, I'll see you in the morning. And don't worry. I know what I'm
doing.  
(Barnes leaves.)  
LUPTON: What is it?  
SPIDER [OC]: The crystal. I can feel it. Concentrate, Lupton. Concentrate!  
LUPTON: What crystal?  
SPIDER [OC]: It is why I have come. To find the crystal and get it back. It
will give us power, the power we both seek. Concentrate!  
LUPTON: I can see a man staring into a blue light. The light of a crystal. A
blue crystal.

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(It is the Doctor, who appears to be in a trance. The crystal is in a clamp on
the table in front of him.)  
BRIGADIER: Doctor. Doctor? Good grief. Sergeant Benton?  
BENTON [OC]: Yes, sir?  
(Benton enters with a cup on a tray.)  
BRIGADIER: Oh, there you are. Looks as if we have an emergency on our hands. I
can't get him to come round. Damn silly idea. Thought so all along.  
(The Brigadier picks up a phone.)  
BRIGADIER: Give me the M.O. Quickly. Oh, is that you, Sullivan? Get over to
the lab straight away.  
(Benton puts the cup down in front of the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: Absolutely beautiful.  
BRIGADIER: What's that, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Oh, the smell of that coffee. Thank you, Sergeant.  
BRIGADIER: Forget it, Sullivan.  
DOCTOR: You know, I've always said that next to Mrs Samuel Pepys you make the
finest cup of coffee in the world.  
BENTON: Thank you very much, Doctor. Actually the secret of it is, is to get
the water  
BRIGADIER: Yeah. Look, never mind the dratted coffee. What about the spiders?  
DOCTOR: Spiders?  
BRIGADIER: The ones in the crystal.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. You know, Brigadier, when I was a young man, there was an old
hermit who lived half way up a mountain just behind our house. I spent some of
the finest hours of my life with that old man.  
BRIGADIER: What are you talking about?  
DOCTOR: And it was from him I first learnt how to look into my mind.  
BRIGADIER: The crystal, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: That's what I'm trying to tell you, Brigadier. When I looked into that
crystal, all I could see was the face of my old teacher.

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

(Mike is starting to go up the staircase when Tommy takes his arm and pulls
him back.)  
TOMMY: Go to bed, Yates.  
MIKE: But I must see K'Anpo.  
TOMMY: K'Anpo Tommy's friend. He like to be alone. Now go to bed.  
MIKE: But Tom.  
TOMMY: I fetch Cho-Je, or I hit you!  
MIKE: No, no. Don't do that. I won't go up.  
TOMMY: Good. Tommy don't like to hit you. Oh, that's pretty.  
(Tommy takes hold of a silver pendant Mike is wearing.)  
MIKE: Here you are. Yours.  
TOMMY: For Tommy? Oh. Oh, that's pretty. Go to bed, mister. Go to bed.  
(Tommy leaves, gazing at his shiny new prize, but before Mike can go up the
stairs...)  
LUPTON [OC]: What excellent advice!  
(Lupton enters.)  
LUPTON: Time for all good little boys to go to bed, don't you agree?  
MIKE: Oh, yes, yes.  
LUPTON: Goodnight.  
MIKE: Goodnight.  
(Mike walks off, and Lupton watches him.)

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

(The Doctor is examining the crystal again, this time using some gizmos.)  
DOCTOR: Of course I'm listening, Sarah. Go on. What happened next?  
SARAH: Well, then we climbed in the window, you see, and went straight down to
the cellar.  
DOCTOR: Hmm mmm.  
SARAH: Oh, no, not straight down, because of Tommy. Oh, but he's not really
mixed up in this. At least, I suppose he isn't.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's fascinating.  
SARAH: Hmm?  
DOCTOR: The crystal lattice is equally balanced from right to left. It's
remarkable.  
SARAH: You see, you're not listening to a word!  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I am. You went down into the cellar to see if Tommy was
still there, right?  
SARAH: Half right. Oh please, do try to pay attention, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Probably analogous to the laser. Well, go on! I'm listening.  
SARAH: Right. So, there they all were in the cellar, chanting away like
billy-o. And all of a sudden this giant spider appeared and jumped on Lupton's
back!  
DOCTOR: It's coherent thought.  
SARAH: Oh, Doctor, really!  
DOCTOR: A scientific pun. What did you say?  
SARAH: I said really. This is important, but you're so interested in that
wretched  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, before that. What did you say before that? Did you say
spider?  
SARAH: That's right.  
DOCTOR: Now listen to me, Sarah. This is very important. Tell me the whole
story right from the beginning.  
SARAH: Oh.

**[UNIT car park]**

(A UNIT soldier is doing something to the Doctor's space car when he notices
someone there.)  
SOLDIER: Excuse me, sir. Can I help you?  
LUPTON: Oh, thanks very much. Er, where's the Doctor?  
SOLDIER: The medical officer? Well, this time of the day, he'll be  
LUPTON: No, no, no, no. The other Doctor.  
SOLDIER: Oh, yes, of course. In his lab, I should think. It's through that
door over there.  
LUPTON: Thanks very much.  
SOLDIER: Oh, hang about, sir. May I see your pass?  
LUPTON: Pass?  
SOLDIER: Didn't they give you one at the main gate, sir?  
LUPTON: Oh. Yes, of course, how stupid of me! Here. (Lupton aims his fingers
at the soldier, and blue energy zaps him.)

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

DOCTOR: So you see, it's after seeing these spiders that he died. So, there
must be some connection.  
SARAH: Where did the crystal come from anyway?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I brought it back some time ago from a planet called Metebelis
Three.  
SARAH: I've never heard of it.  
DOCTOR: Oh, you wouldn't have done. It's also called the blue planet because
the moonlight is blue, you see?  
SARAH: Oh. And did you just happen to stumble across the planet and find this
crystal, accidental like?  
DOCTOR: No, I went there deliberately to fetch it. It has strange properties,
a Metebelis crystal. It can affect the mind.  
SARAH: The mind? You mean it could drive someone mad?  
DOCTOR: No, just the opposite usually. It clears the mind and amplifies its
power.  
SARAH: But it could be used for evil purposes?  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, of course, if the mind operating it was motivated by evil.  
SARAH: So, if the giant spiders on Metebelis Three wanted that crystal back  
DOCTOR: But there aren't any giant spiders on Metebelis Three. At least, there
weren't any when I was there.

**[UNIT HQ]**

BENTON: Excuse me, sir.  
LUPTON: Yes?  
BENTON: You have a pass, of course?  
LUPTON: Oh yes, of course.  
(Lupton walks round a corner.)  
BENTON: Hey, wait!  
(And gets zapped for his diligence.)

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

DOCTOR: Wait a minute. There could be a time difference.  
SARAH: Come again? Oh, I get it! You mean the spiders come from an earlier era
than your visit?  
(Someone is moving outside the frosted glass windows of the lab.)  
DOCTOR: Or a later one.  
SARAH: What if you're wrong?  
DOCTOR: No, just wait a minute. Give me a chance to work this thing out.

**[Outside UNIT Laboratory]**

LUPTON: It's there. The blue crystal. It must be the one.  
SPIDER [OC]: Of course it is. You forget I can see through your eyes. Now,
concentrate. Concentrate!

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

SARAH: You know, this is barmy. Here am I, calmly discussing fabulous planets
with blue moons, giant spiders, magic crystals, as if I was talking about er,
pussycats, fish and chips and the Liverpool docks.  
DOCTOR: Well, they're just as real.  
SARAH: Oh, I know, but that's what gets me.  
(The crystal vanishes.)  
SARAH: Doctor!

**[UNIT HQ]**

(The crystal has teleported into Lupton's hand. He walks off with it, only to
meet up with a recovering Benton.)  
BENTON: Here, what are you doing?  
(Lupton punches Benton in the stomach and leaves. The Doctor and Sarah run
up.)  
DOCTOR: What happened, Sergeant? Somebody attack you?  
BENTON: Yes, and he's got that crystal of yours, Doctor. Come on!

**[UNIT car park]**

(Lupton sees the Brigadier walking from a row of Land Rovers.)  
BENTON: Sir! Stop him!  
(The Brigadier draws his service revolver.)  
BRIGADIER: Put your hands in the air.  
(Lupton runs, the Brigadier fires and misses three times. Lupton gets into the
Whomobile and drives off as the Brigadier empties his revolver at him.)  
DOCTOR: No, no, Brigadier! You'll damage my car. (Benton starts up Bessie and
drives her over to them.)  
BENTON: Here you are, Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Well done, Sergeant. Take me to the airstrip. We'll spot him from the
air.

**[Airstrip]**

DOCTOR: Get after him, Lethbridge Stewart. I'll contact you by R/T.  
BRIGADIER: Move over, Benton.  
BENTON: Okay, sir.  
(The Doctor runs over to a gyrocopter - G-AXVK - puts on a helmet and gets in.
Very James Bond. The Brigadier drives Bessie away in pursuit of Lupton through
rolling English lanes around Membury.)

**[Gyrocopter]**

DOCTOR: Hello, Brigadier? Look, is this thing working? Can you hear me? Over.

**[Bessie]**

BRIGADIER: Loud and clear, Doctor. Have you had a sight of him? Over.

**[Gyrocopter]**

DOCTOR: Yes, he's getting away from you. Take the next right fork. Try and cut
him off. Out.  
(It works. Bessie is right on the Whomobile's tail now. Lupton spots both
Bessie and the gyrocopter overhead and puts his foot down.)

**[Road]**

(A policeman is parked up in a panda car.)  
POLICEMAN: Panda Three to control. I'm at the junction of Mallet Lane with
Athenum Road. Nothing to report. Over.  
CONTROL [OC]: Received, Panda Three. Your message timed at ten fifteen. Out.  
(Then the chase whizzes past him.)  
POLICEMAN: Panda Three to control. I've just spotted a silver hovercraft being
chased by an old crock at ninety miles an hour, and there's a little tiny
helicopter after them both! I'm in pursuit. Over.  
CONTROL [OC]: Thank you, Panda Three. Signal if you need assistance. (pause)
What did you say?  
(The policeman heads off, in hot pursuit, screeching to a halt just past a
junction that the Doctor's vehicles have taken, and reversing up to follow.)

**[Gyrocopter]**

DOCTOR: He's turned off to the right, Brigadier. I say again. He's turned off
to the right.  
(The police car follows.)

**[Airfield]**

(Lupton has deserted the Whomobile, and the Doctor lands the gyrocopter.
Bessie drives up.)  
DOCTOR: Look, he can't be far away, Brigadier. We must spread out and search.  
(Lupton is watching from the long grass. The policeman walks over to the
group.)  
POLICEMAN: Now, wait a moment. I want a few particulars. You must have touched
ninety back there.  
BRIGADIER: Not now, Constable. Look, Doctor  
SPIDER [OC]: We must escape in the flying machine.  
LUPTON: I don't know how to fly it.  
SPIDER [OC]: The principle seems simple. I will guide your hands. Come!  
BRIGADIER: I think the answer is this  
(Lupton gets into the gyrocopter.)  
SARAH: Doctor!  
(The gyrocopter takes off.)  
SARAH: He's got away!  
DOCTOR: Oh no, he hasn't.  
(The Doctor gets into his space car.)  
SARAH: Hey, you're not going without me.  
DOCTOR: Right, fasten your seatbelt.  
BRIGADIER: But Doctor, you'll never catch him. He's airborne!  
DOCTOR: Stand well back, Brigadier.  
(The Doctor pulls down the carapace, powers her up and sets off down the
runway.)  
SARAH: Doctor, we're flying!  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course we're flying.  
BRIGADIER: Come on, Benton.  
(The Policeman gives up and goes back to his car.)  
POLICEMAN: Panda Three to control. You'll never believe this, Sergeant, but.
Oh, nothing to report, over. I'm coming in. I don't feel very well. Over.

**[Whomobile]**

DOCTOR: Now, keep your eyes peeled for the gyroplane.  
SARAH: There he is!  
DOCTOR: Right, hang on!  
(They fly parallel to the gyro. Lupton can't believe his eyes.)  
SARAH: Well, now you've caught up with him, what are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: Nothing. He can't last much longer. He must be almost out of fuel.

**[Gyrocopter]**

SPIDER [OC]: We must return to the ground. There is very little liquid left to
burn.  
LUPTON: You mean we've got no fuel?  
SPIDER [OC]: We have enough.

**[Space car]**

DOCTOR: Right, here we go. Coming in to land.  
(Lupton has already landed in a field, and run down to the nearby River
Severn. The Doctor lands, and he and Sarah run off.)

**[Mooring]**

(Lupton slithers down to where an old barge is propped up on the river bank,
and sees a man mooring a small motor boat. Then a tiny hovercraft rushes up
onto the bank. The man calls out to its pilot.)  
MAN: Fantastic, Mister Hopkins. If I had enough money, I'd buy twenty of them.  
HOPKINS: Look out!  
(Lupton pushes the man into the river and tries to relaunch his boat.)  
HOPKINS: Hey!  
(Hopkins gets zapped. The Doctor and Sarah arrive to see the boat out in the
river, and its owner trying to climb back on board. They go to the hovercraft.
Lupton finally gets the motorboat started.)  
MAN: Come back!  
(The Doctor gives chase although he isn't quite as manoeuvrable and has to use
the shore to do a turn at one point. Lupton carries on down river and the
Doctor makes for the opposite bank.)

**[Boat]**

LUPTON: We've lost him!  
(The Doctor is cutting across a large oxbow by land and flies straight over a
tramp who has just laid down for a sleep. He rejoins the river in the little
boat's wake.)  
LUPTON: He'll catch us!  
SPIDER [OC]: I'll get help from Metebelis. Concentrate! Concentrate!  
(The hovercraft comes alongside and the Doctor jumps into the boat. But Lupton
has vanished!)

__**Part Three**__

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

(Tommy comes out of the cupboard under the stairs and looks around the corner
to see Lupton materialising.)  
TOMMY: Clever Lupton.  
(Lupton takes the Metebelis crystal out of his jacket pocket.)  
TOMMY: Pretty.  
(Tommy backs away as Cho-Je enters the hallway.)  
CHO-JE: Mister Lupton.  
(Cho-Je passes Tommy's hiding place and goes into a room. Lupton checks that
Cho-Je is out of sight and leaves, followed carefully by Tommy.)

**[Lupton's room]**

(A basic lodger's room.)  
LUPTON: We've done it.  
SPIDER [OC]: Yes, we've done it. Together.  
LUPTON: Will this give us power?  
SPIDER [OC]: More power than you dared to dream of. Veil your mind! You must
cloak your ambition. I can understand it, perhaps I share it, but if my
sisters on Metebelis Three were to have an inkling of your thoughts, they
would kill you. Beware! They seek to make the link.

**[Spider's Council Chamber]**

(Lupton's face is half seen. It is a mental link only and he has not been
teleported there.)  
QUEEN: We are successful?  
SPIDER: Totally. The crystal is ours.  
QUEEN: You have done well.  
SPIDER [OC]: I thank you, O Queen.  
QUEEN: Now you must prepare to return, bringing the crystal with you.  
SPIDER [OC]: It shall be done.  
LUPTON: What about me? I am to be forgotten?  
QUEEN: You are not necessary!  
LUPTON: Oh, but I am. Without me, you would never have recovered your precious
crystal. I've been your friend.  
QUEEN: A friend? A two leg dares to claim friendship with the eight legs, the
noble ones?  
SPIDER [OC]: He means no harm, O Queen, and it is true that he has served us
well.  
QUEEN: Very well. His reward will be to serve us further. We could use him in
the great work, the conquest of Earth.  
SPIDER [OC]: Conquest?  
QUEEN: This is the secret purpose of the Great One.  
COUNCIL: All praise to the Great One!  
QUEEN: That is why she requires the crystal. We shall return to our rightful
home, Earth, as rulers. We have exhausted our power. Be ready to return. Be
ready.

**[Lupton's room]**

(Lupton opens the window and breathes deeply.)  
SPIDER [OC]: Rest now. Let the power return to your body, and to your mind.  
(Lupton collapses onto his bed.)  
SPIDER [OC]: Sleep, Lupton, sleep.  
(The Spider appears, leaves Lupton's back crosses the floor. It vanishes then
reappears in the corridor outside.)

**[Sitting room]**

(Cho-Je is entertaining guests - the Doctor, Sarah and Mike.)  
CHO-JE: I can understand your distress at losing a valuable piece of
equipment, er, Doctor? However, I feel you are mistaken in suggesting that
Mister Lupton had anything to do with it.  
(Barnes has overheard enough, and leaves.)  
SARAH: But I saw him. I recognised him.  
CHO-JE: When? How far away from here?  
DOCTOR: Oh, about eighty miles, I should say.  
SARAH: And we lost sight of him at about half past ten or thereabouts.  
CHO-JE: At half past ten I was walking to the meditation class and I saw
Mister Lupton in the corridor.  
MIKE: But, but, that's impossible.  
CHO-JE: Precisely. So one of us is mistaken. You cannot believe he was
transported here in the winking of an eye.  
DOCTOR: No, no, of course not.  
MIKE: Well, stranger things have happened.  
SARAH: You can say that again.  
MIKE: Much stranger.  
(The Spider approaches the open door.)  
CHO-JE: As we both know, such things are child's play to a master of sorcerer,
but you cannot believe that Mister Lupton is a sorcerer. We have no magicians
here, I do assure you.

**[Lupton's room]**

BARNES: Lupton. Lupton, wake up. Wake up!  
LUPTON: What is it?  
BARNES: That girl's back. She's brought somebody with her called the Doctor.  
LUPTON: Has she indeed?  
BARNES: Now they're saying that you.  
(Lupton is holding the crystal.)  
BARNES: Then it's true. Lupton, we've got to stop this. We're meddling in
things we don't understand.  
LUPTON: Are we now.  
BARNES: Now listen to me. Is that thing on your back at this moment?  
LUPTON: How very strange. No, it's not.  
BARNES: Right, let's get away from here. Now, while the going's good.  
LUPTON: Barnes, do you know why I came to this place?  
BARNES: No, not really.  
(Lupton puts the crystal on the desk and goes to wash his face.)  
LUPTON: All right. Potted history coming up. Picture me, bright young
salesman. Salesman of the year, Sales Manager, Sales Director. I gave them
twenty five years of my life! Are you with me so far?  
BARNES: Yes, yes.  
LUPTON: Then the finance boys moved in. Merger, takeover, golden handshake.
Me, out on the streets. I could even have taken that, but when I tried to set
up of my own, they deliberately, cold bloodedly broke me.  
(Tommy has appeared at the open window. He spots the crystal, reaches in and
takes it.)  
LUPTON: I'm still looking for some of the bits.  
BARNES: So you came here to get peace of mind?  
LUPTON: Ha! I came here to get power. Do you think I'm going to let go now
when it's in sight, when I can see myself taking over that firm, taking over
the country, the entire stinking world. I want to see them grovel, I want to
see them breaking their hearts, I want to see them eating dirt.  
BARNES: I came here just to look for peace of mind.

**[Tommy's cupboard]**

(Tommy goes into his secret place and switches on the light. He takes a shoe
box out of an old suitcase.)  
TOMMY: Ah, pretty.  
(He puts the crystal in the box with all the other shiny objects he's
obtained.)  
TOMMY: All Tommy's pretties.

**[Lupton's room]**

BARNES: So what are we going to do?  
LUPTON: When I've learned how to use that crystal, I shan't need the spiders
anymore.  
(The Spider materialises.)  
BARNES: Lupton, look!  
SPIDER: Your master will come to fetch you soon.  
LUPTON: My master? You mean Cho-Je? Why?  
SPIDER: To talk to the Doctor.  
BARNES: Is it speaking to you? What's it saying?  
SPIDER: Send this fool away.  
LUPTON: Very well. Off you go, Barnes.  
BARNES: What are we going to do?  
LUPTON: Later, man, later.  
BARNES: Oh, very well.  
(Lupton leaves.)  
SPIDER: We must prepare to meet this Doctor.  
LUPTON: I see no necessity.  
SPIDER: He could be dangerous.  
LUPTON: So could I. So could I.  
SPIDER: You will go to see him.  
LUPTON: I shall not.  
SPIDER: You forget, Lupton. We are linked together now. I can twist your mind
as easily as a two leg boy twists another's arm. Like this!  
(Lupton grabs his head in pain.)  
LUPTON: Oh, stop!  
SPIDER: You won't need the spiders anymore. Isn't that what you said?  
LUPTON: Stop, I can't bear it!  
SPIDER: Say please.  
LUPTON: Please! Please! (The Spider releases him.)  
LUPTON: Oh.  
SPIDER: You will go to see the Doctor and lull his suspicions. In future you
will do as I wish.  
LUPTON: What did you do to my mind? It felt like red-hot needles. Was it, was
it this that you did? Or no. No, was it this!  
(Lupton glares at the Spider and it writhes on the floor.)  
SPIDER: Ah! No! No, stop.  
LUPTON: Say please.  
SPIDER: Please, Lupton! Please!  
(Lupton stops.)  
SPIDER: You are cleverer than the two legs on Metebelis Three.  
LUPTON: I'm cleverer than most of them on Earth.  
SPIDER: Very well, you need not see this man. Come, we must make ready.  
LUPTON: I'm not going to Metebelis Three just to become a slave to that Queen
of yours.  
SPIDER: I like her arrogance no more than you do. You seek power on Earth. I
shall seize it on Metebelis. We can help each other. Turn around.  
LUPTON: Very well.  
(The Spider jumps onto his back and vanishes.)  
SPIDER [OC]: Now, the crystal.  
(Lupton searches the deck.)  
LUPTON: It's gone. The crystal has gone!

**[Sitting room]**

DOCTOR: Look, Venerable, may we see this man Lupton now? I'm sorry to seem
pushy but it is very important.  
CHO-JE: It is good that we have come to the west. You whip your poor horse too
much. He gallops so that he is exhausted and yet, you know, he never leaves
his stable.  
SARAH: Now what's that supposed to mean?  
MIKE: I think he's saying that, er, time is an illusion.  
DOCTOR: And it'll all be the same in a hundred years. Yes, where have I heard
that before?  
(Tommy comes down the stairs to the doorway and whispers to Sarah.)  
TOMMY: Hey. Hey.  
CHO-JE: There is only the now. The here and the now. The present moment will
have to

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

(Sarah leaves the sitting room.)  
SARAH: Hello, Tommy.  
TOMMY: Hello, Sarah Jane Smith. Tommy like you.  
SARAH: Well, I like you too.  
TOMMY: You give Tommy nice presents, it's pretty.  
SARAH: Oh, I haven't got another one, I'm afraid.  
TOMMY: No, no. Tommy got nice present for Sarah Jane Smith. You come.  
SARAH: Oh, well, not just now, Tommy.  
TOMMY: You come, Sarah Jane Smith.  
(Tommy takes hold of her hand.)  
SARAH: Okay, okay, but we'll have to be quick.

**[Sitting room]**

MIKE: Suppose it'll mean something to me in the end.  
CHO-JE: Ah, the meaning of meaning is the last barrier to understanding.  
DOCTOR: Yes, er, Venerable, could we see Mister Lupton now please?  
CHO-JE: But of course. Mister Moss?  
(Moss enters.)  
CHO-JE: If you would both wait here, this gentleman will find Mister Lupton
for you.  
MOSS: Of course.  
(Moss leaves.)  
CHO-JE: Excuse me, Doctor.  
(Cho-Je spins the prayer wheel as he enters the inner room.)

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

BARNES: I didn't take it. I wouldn't know what to do with it if I had it.  
LUPTON: But you saw it?  
BARNES: Well, of course I did. You put it on the table.  
LUPTON: Could it have been sent to Metebelis Three?  
SPIDER [OC]: No, my sisters haven't the power, you remember. The crystal must
still be on Earth.  
LUPTON: Then we must find it.  
SPIDER [OC]: There is no time. The power is building fast. We must be ready!  
LUPTON: We don't have to go.  
SPIDER [OC]: If the Queen finds out that we have lost the crystal, she'll kill
us both.  
LUPTON: Right, we'll bluff them. We'll pretend we've still got it.  
SPIDER [OC]: But they'll never believe it.  
LUPTON: We have no choice. Now listen, Barnes.  
BARNES: Perhaps you've gone mad, hearing voices, talking to yourself.  
LUPTON: You saw the spider, didn't you?  
BARNES: Perhaps I've gone mad too.  
(Barnes and Lupton go into a room. Tommy brings Sarah to the stairs cupboard.)  
TOMMY: You stay. Tommy get present. Secret.  
(Tommy goes into his cupboard.)  
BARNES [OC]: Shall I look for the others then?  
LUPTON [OC]: No, no, no.  
(Sarah peers round the corner.)  
LUPTON: I'll go through the ritual by myself.  
BARNES: In the cellar? Now?  
LUPTON: Yes, yes. See if you can keep the others away for half an hour or so,
will you?  
MOSS: Lupton, Cho-Je wants you to meet some fellow with Yates.  
LUPTON: Yes, I know, I know. Tell him, er, tell him you can't find me. I'll
need the mandala.  
(Lupton and Barnes go into a room. Moss leaves. Tommy comes out of his
cupboard.)  
TOMMY: Sarah Jane Smith.  
SARAH: Oh, not now, Tommy.  
TOMMY: No, I  
SARAH: No, not now. Tommy, you know Mike Yates, don't you?  
TOMMY: Yates. He give Tommy present!  
SARAH: Yes, yes, listen, Tommy. Now listen carefully. I want you to go and
find Mike Yates and tell him that Lupton has gone down to the cellar.  
TOMMY: Cellar.  
SARAH: And that I'm going down there too.  
TOMMY: You  
SARAH: Okay?  
TOMMY: Cellar you  
SARAH: I've got to go. I must get there first. Cellar, Tommy.  
(Sarah leaves.)  
TOMMY: But Sarah Jane Smith, your present!  
(Tommy holds out the crystal. Lupton comes out of the room with the mandala
rolled up under his arm and goes the other way.)  
TOMMY: Yates.

**[** **Cellar]**

(Sarah has got there first and hides as Lupton enters, puts down a cushion and
the mandala, sits and begins the chant.)  
LUPTON: Om mani padme hum. Om mani padme hum.

**[Sitting room]**

MIKE: This is ridiculous. Where's that fellow got to?  
(Tommy enters, without his box.)  
TOMMY: Yates. Sarah.  
MIKE: Not now Tommy.  
TOMMY: Sarah, cellar.  
MIKE: Not now.  
TOMMY: I tell you, mister, the cellar.  
DOCTOR: I think he's trying to tell you something important, Mike.  
MIKE: It always is.  
(Moss enters.)  
MIKE: Ah, there you are.  
MOSS: I'm sorry. I can't find Lupton anywhere.  
TOMMY: Lupton!  
MOSS: He's not in his room, he's not meditating. He's probably gone for a
walk.  
TOMMY: Lupton in the cellar!  
MIKE: What?  
TOMMY: Sarah Jane Smith in the cellar!  
DOCTOR: Where is this cellar, Mike?  
MIKE: I'll show you.  
TOMMY: Hey, hey, mister!  
(The Doctor and Mike leave.)  
TOMMY: I tell him. Tommy did it.  
MOSS: You certainly did.

**[** **Cellar]**

LUPTON: Om mani padme hum, Om mani padme hum, Om mani padme hum.  
(Lupton starts to glow blue and then vanishes. Sarah comes out of hiding and
stands on the mandala.)  
SARAH: Doctor! Mike!

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

(Barnes is standing guard by the cellar door.)  
SARAH [OC]: Doctor, come quickly!  
DOCTOR: Get out of my way!

**[** **Cellar]**

(Sarah can't move her feet.)  
DOCTOR: Sarah, get off that mandala!  
SARAH: (Shouts.) I can't!  
(The Doctor approaches her, then the cellar vanishes and Sarah finds herself
in a desert on an alien world. And so is Lupton. Sarah hides behind a large
rock, then someone puts their hand over her mouth!)

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

MIKE: Barnes? He's gone.  
DOCTOR: Well, never mind. I doubt if he could have told us very much anyway.
Well, there's only one thing for me to do, Mike. I've got to get after her, to
Metebelis Three.  
MIKE: In the Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course.  
MIKE: But how can you be sure you'll get there?  
DOCTOR: Well, the Tardis may be a little erratic, I'll admit. After all, she
is getting on a bit. But Metebelis Three is the one planet I can be absolutely
certain of reaching. You see, I wired the coordinates into the programmer.  
MIKE: Yes, but, but Doctor, a planet's a big place.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I always leave the actual landing to the Tardis herself.
She's no fool, you know.  
MIKE: You speak as if she were alive.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I do, don't I? Bye, Mike.

**[Village]**

(A young man drags Sarah into an Inca or Aztec style village.)  
TUAR: Hey, I found a spy!  
SABOR: (an old man) Tuar, you're a fool. If she's a spy, you've condemned us
all. We're as good as dead.  
TUAR: Look, I'm tired of waiting. The eight legs'll kill us all anyway. It's
time we fought back.  
SABOR: It will do us no good speaking treason. Release her. Release her, I
say!  
REGA: (young girl) Who are you? How did you come here?  
SARAH: Er  
TUAR: Oh, don't waste time, Rega. She's a spy. We must kill her.  
SARAH: Eh?  
SABOR: Already we're in danger. Do you want the whole village wiped out?
Remember Skorda.  
SARAH: But I'm not a spy. I don't know who you are or anything.  
TUAR: You're lying.  
SARAH: Well anyway, who am I supposed to be spying for? The spiders?  
TUAR: You see? Who but a spy would dare use a forbidden word? We must kill her
before she can betray us.  
SARAH: No, no!  
SABOR: Tuar, No!  
(Tuar pushes Sarah up some steps and leans her backwards over the edge, which
is on top of a steep cliff.)  
(A moustachioed man comes out of a building.)  
ARAK: Stop! Tuar, stop!  
(Everyone say Hi! to Gareth Hunt.)  
NESKA: (woman) Arak! Arak! Come back inside, my son!  
ARAK: Let her go! She may be telling the truth. Let her go. You will follow
her, my brother.  
(Arak leads Sarah away from the edge.)  
TUAR: She's a spy.  
ARAK: Rubbish. She is a stranger. Look at her clothes.  
TUAR: A stranger? Where from?  
NESKA: Why not ask her? Where do you come from, child?  
SARAH: I'm, I'm from Earth.  
SABOR: From Earth? But how? Did you come in a starship like your ancestors
did?  
SARAH: Er, no. Well, I don't know how I got here, actually.  
TUAR: You see? She's lying.  
SABOR: Tell the truth, girl.  
(A trumpet sounds.)  
SABOR: How many of you? Where's your ship?  
REGA: Mother, listen! The Queen of the eight legs is coming.  
NESKA: Quickly, my son. Get back into hiding.  
ARAK: Come.  
(Arak and Sarah go into the building.)  
TUAR: She'll betray you! She'll betray us all!

**[Building]**

(The inside is gloomy. Simple pottery and woven baskets are on the wooden
table.)  
SARAH: What is it? What's happening?  
ARAK: Be quiet.  
NESKA: Keep silent, girl. You will bring death to us all.

**[Village]**

(A man leads a litter bearing the Spider Queen into the village.)  
GUARD: Hear now, Huarth, most noble of the noble ones, Queen of the eight
legs, speaks thus. Arak, male two leg, having attacked field guard Draga,
leaving him for dead, the same Arak will now surrender himself.

**[Building]**

GUARD [OC]: If Arak does not come forth, one male two leg will be taken from
each family of the settlement to suffer the retribution due for the foul crime
of Arak.  
ARAK: I must go, Mother.  
NESKA: No! No!  
SABOR: I'll speak to the Queen. Maybe she'll listen to me.  
NESKA: No, Sabor, it's too dangerous.  
SABOR: The people need Arak. They trust him, they listen to him. He's our last
chance.  
TUAR: That's true, Arak.  
GUARD [OC]: Arak, come forth!

**[Village]**

(Sabor comes out of the building and kneels before the Queen.)  
GUARD: Sabor, where is your son?  
SABOR: I beg leave to speak to the Queen.  
QUEEN: Speak, Sabor.  
SABOR: Draga is a bad field guard. He's unfair, he's cruel. He struck Neska,
Arak's mother, for no good reason.  
QUEEN: Silence! This is not to the point. Did he or did he not strike my
guard?  
SABOR: He did, but surely there's a  
QUEEN: Then he must die. Where is he?  
SABOR: He's gone to the hills.  
GUARD: How do you know?  
SABOR: Because I helped him.

**[Building]**

ARAK: No!  
TUAR: Look, it's no good! If you go out there, they'll kill you both.

**[Village]**

QUEEN: You know the penalty? You know that you will take his place?  
SABOR: Yes.  
QUEEN: Very well. Justice is satisfied. Let us return.

**[Building]**

SARAH: What's going to happen to him?  
TUAR: The eight legs will eat him, of course.  
NESKA: No!

**[Village]**

NESKA: No, I shan't. You shan't take him! Sabor, my husband, my love! Why did
you do it? Why? Why?  
GUARD: Woman, get back!  
SABOR: This is the best way I know.  
NESKA: I shan't let them take you. I shan't, I shan't.  
GUARD: Guard!  
(A guard holds a staff with a blue gem at the end against Neska's arm. It
flashes and she falls.)  
REGA: Mother! Mother!  
(Sarah looks out of the doorway.)  
QUEEN: Wait! There is a stranger here. Guards!

**[Building]**

SARAH: She saw me. They're coming. The guards are coming!  
TUAR: See? She has betrayed you.  
ARAK: Quick, you must hide.  
SARAH: No. They mustn't find you.

**[Village]**

SARAH: Okay, okay. I'll come quietly.  
(The Doctor runs into the laboratory and then into the Tardis. It
dematerialises, and appears in the middle of the village. The Doctor steps
out.)  
DOCTOR: Hello, Sarah Jane.  
GUARD: Stop!  
(A guard uses his staff on the Doctor, but it has no effect.)  
DOCTOR: Don't do that.  
QUEEN: Let him approach.  
GUARD: You will kneel to the most noble Queen.  
DOCTOR: The Queen? Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Greetings, O most noble Queen. May
I ask what you intend to do with this young lady?  
QUEEN: You do not speak like a two leg. Where have you come from?  
DOCTOR: Both Miss Smith and I come from Earth, your Majesty.  
QUEEN: From Earth? Then you are the one who. No. No, that cannot be. We shall
return. Bring this two leg. We shall question him with the female.  
DOCTOR: Now just a minute, your Majesty.  
GUARD: Over there!  
(Another guard prods the Doctor's back with his staff. The Doctor turns and
uses his Venusian Akido on him and then all the other guards in turn. Neska
and Rega hand Sarah a cloak and she puts it on before slipping away while the
Doctor throws two guards at the same time. Then the Captain zaps him with an
energy bolt, and he falls by the Tardis door.)

__**Part Four**__

**[Village]**

(The villagers tussle with the guards.)  
GUARD: Silence! Silence!  
QUEEN: So shall perish all two legs who would dare to question our power.  
GUARD: (sotto) I've never seen them like this before.  
QUEEN: (sotto) I think it would be wise to leave.  
GUARD: The girl. She's gone!  
QUEEN: Then you will be punished! We cannot wait. It will soon be dark. Bring
the male.  
(The guards take Sabor away, as Sarah watches from behind a crowd of
villagers.  
Back at the lamasery, Mike watches Barnes let the rest of the cabal into his
room. There is a Do Not Disturb sign on the door so he goes to listen at the
door.  
Rega and Arak take the grieving Neska into the building. The rest of the
villagers have dispersed, and Sarah is cradling the Doctor's head in her lap.)  
SARAH: Well, can't you do something?  
TUAR: No, it's no good. He's dead.  
SARAH: He can't be!  
TUAR: They can use their power to give pain, or to stun, or to kill. Your
friend is dead.  
SARAH: No. Doctor! Doctor!  
TUAR: Look, leave him. If you stay out here we'll all be dead. It's almost
time for the curfew. Bury him tomorrow.  
(Tuar pulls Sarah away.)  
SARAH: Look! Look, he moved. He moved his hand.  
TUAR: Impossible.  
SARAH: I saw him! He's alive. He's alive, I tell you.  
(Sarah runs back to the Doctor, who groans.)  
TUAR: You're right. He is alive.  
SARAH: Oh, oh, Doctor.

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

BARNES [OC]: He didn't tell me much, but he wouldn't, would he.

**[Barnes' room]**

MOSS: Where is he?  
BARNES: I don't know. He seemed to think he'd be taken to the home of that,
that creature.  
LAND: The spider?  
BARNES: You see, I didn't get the chance to discuss it with him properly. You
know what he was.  
KEAVER: Was? He's not dead, is he?  
BARNES: Well, he may be. How do I know? He's just vanished.  
LAND: What are we going to do?  
MOSS: Get out while the going's good.  
KEAVER: Why? We haven't done anything criminal.  
MOSS: Tell that to the police.  
LAND: The police?  
BARNES: For heaven's sake. It's not that. Nobody need know yet. Perhaps he's
trying to get back and can't.  
(The door handle turns. Barnes goes over and opens it suddenly.)  
TOMMY: Hello, Barnes.  
BARNES: What are you doing here? Spying, is that it?  
TOMMY: I spy. That's a nice game. I spy with my little eye  
BARNES: Can't you read?  
TOMMY: Tommy's learning to read. My mum brought me a book.  
BARNES: Get away from here. If I catch you spying on me again.

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

(Barnes slams the door shut. Tommy tries to read the notice.)  
TOMMY: D. Do. Do. Don. Going to do some reading.  
(Tommy leaves. Mike comes out of an adjacent room and listens at the door
again.)

**[Building]**

(The Doctor is sleeping on a low cot.)  
SARAH: Why is that bell ringing?  
ARAK: It's the curfew. It's death to be out after twilight.  
(The Doctor moans.)  
SARAH: He seems to be getting worse.  
ARAK: He's dying.  
SARAH: No, no!  
REGA: Better dead than captured like, like Sabor.  
TUAR: We shall be avenged, Rega.  
REGA: Will vengeance bring my father back to me?  
ARAK: Rega, he gave his life to save me. He gave his life for the freedom of
our people.  
SARAH: Is there nothing we can do?  
REGA: Nothing. There is no cure. He should be dead.

**[Spider's Council Chamber]**

(The Queen is carried in on her litter.)  
QUEEN: Stop. Set me down.  
QUEEN: Who is this two leg who dares to sit in the place of Huar, Queen of
Metebelis?  
LUPTON: I have come from Earth.  
QUEEN: Silence! We do not speak with the two leg. Answer me, sister.  
SPIDER: This is Lupton, O Queen. I have brought him from Earth as the council
asked.  
QUEEN: As the council asked? As we commanded. Guards!  
SPIDER: Perhaps the days of the Queen's commands are numbered?  
QUEEN: You would dare to speak treason to my face? Seize the two leg!  
LUPTON: You forget the crystal, O Queen.  
QUEEN: Wait.  
LUPTON: We have the crystal.  
SPIDER: It is true. You do not dare to harm us.  
QUEEN: Where is it? Show it to us.  
LUPTON: We know where it is hidden.  
QUEEN: But the Great One awaits the crystal.  
SPIDERS: All praise to the Great One.  
LUPTON: Then the Great One will have to go on waiting until we have received
the rewards of our success.  
QUEEN: And you, sister? What have you to say?  
SPIDER: I, I agree with Lupton.  
QUEEN: I see. It would seem that you are not aware of the extent of your
failure.  
LUPTON: Failure?  
QUEEN: You were followed to Metebelis by two Earth spies. The male is dead,
but the female lives, a danger to the state and our person. I suggest,
sisters, that until she has been captured, we refuse to listen to these, these
traitors. Do you agree?

**[Tommy's cupboard]**

(Tommy arranges his shiny treasures around the cubby hole, including the
crystal, which is at eye level when he sits on the floor to read his book.)  
TOMMY: Going to school. We give the f, flowers some  
(He glances over at the crystal.)  
TOMMY: Water. We say our  
(The crystal begins to glow. Tommy stares at it then passes out. Over on
Metebelis, Sarah wakes from a doze to mop the Doctor's brow. Tommy wakes up
with the crystal in his hand. He starts reading the little book again, but
without hesitating over the words now.)  
TOMMY: We say our prayers. Then we write our news. We read in the book corner.
We measure and we weigh. We buy things at the shop. We have our milk. We play
in the playing ground. We dance and

**[Building]**

ARAK: How is our mother?  
REGA: She's asleep now, though I'm afraid her dreams will frighten her awake.  
TUAR: I heard her call.  
REGA: She calls his name, Sabor, as though she was searching for him.  
ARAK: Those vicious inhuman creatures!  
REGA: Shush! Keep your voice down if you must speak treason.  
ARAK: They make keep him alive for a week or more. If only we could rescue
him.  
TUAR: Of course. We must attack.  
ARAK: It would be suicide.  
TUAR: Well, is my brother afraid?  
ARAK: That I am.  
TUAR: A coward then?  
ARAK: Take that word back or I'll stuff it down your throat.  
TUAR: I'm not afraid of you, or of the eight legs, but if you won't attack,
you are a coward.  
ARAK: Why you  
REGA: Stop it! Squabbling like herd boys and your mother half-distracted. How
will quarreling bring your father back?  
ARAK: We might as well throw ourselves off the cliff as attack the eight legs.  
SARAH: If the Doctor were alive and well, he could help you. I know he could.  
TUAR: How? How could he help?  
SARAH: Well, I don't know how, but he could. Oh, Doctor, please wake up!  
DOCTOR: Sarah.  
SARAH: Yes, yes, I'm here.  
DOCTOR: Sarah. Tardis. In the, in the Tardis there's a machine in that old,
old leather satchel. It's the only thing that will save me.  
SARAH: Machine in the old leather satchel.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
SARAH: The key? Doctor, where's the key to the Tardis?  
(But the Doctor is asleep again.)  
SARAH: It's okay. Okay.  
(Sarah pulls the key chain out of his waistcoat pocket.)  
REGA: Machine? What kind of machine can save a man's life?  
SARAH: I don't know, but if he needs it, I'm going to get it for him.  
ARAK: If they catch you, they'll kill you.  
(Sarah runs across the square, taking cover behind some sacks as a pair of
guards pass by. She lets herself into the Tardis.)  
ARAK: She has courage.  
TUAR: She's a fool to risk her life. Nothing can save him.

**[Village]**

(Sarah comes out of the Tardis and puts the satchel down, then locks the door.
Before she can pick the satchel up again...)  
LUPTON: Well, well, well. Our clever young female journalist. You are keen to
get your story, aren't you? What a pity it will never be published.

**[Building]**

ARAK: Let me pass, I say.  
TUAR: They'll kill you. Would you so betray our father's love? Sabor left you
here in trust to lead us in our fight for freedom.  
ARAK: A fine leader. One by one the eight legs take us. Soon our settlement
will be as empty as Skorda.  
TUAR: The people of Skorda were cowards. They didn't attack the eight legs,
they just sat there like sheep in a slaughter pen waiting for death.  
ARAK: But if we attack we are as dead as the people of Skorda. We must think
of something else. Wait. The girl said this man could help us.  
TUAR: How can a dead man help us?  
REGA: The machine.  
(The satchel is still on the ground by the Tardis.)  
ARAK: There it is. The bag he spoke of. I'm going to get it. If I don't come
back, it's up to you.  
(Arak sprints across to the Tardis and picks up the satchel, then waits to
check the way back is still clear.)  
REGA: Arak's not a coward.  
TUAR: No, he's not.  
(Arak runs back in, then takes the strange hand held device from the satchel.)  
TUAR: What should we do?  
ARAK: I don't know.  
DOCTOR: Sarah. Sarah Jane.  
TUAR: She's not here.  
ARAK: She left this machine for you, but we don't know what we should do.  
DOCTOR: Give it to me.  
(The Doctor takes the device, and grasps a lever at the top. There is a
buzzing sound and the others back away. Energy bursts from the Doctor's
fingers.)  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you very much.  
(And falls asleep again.)

**[Library]**

(Tommy enters, turns on a standard lamp and selects a book at random.)  
TOMMY: Tiger, tiger, burning bright, in the forests of the night. What
immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry? That's pretty. No,
that's beautiful.  
(He starts to gather an armful of books from the shelves.)

**[Cell]**

(Sarah is pushed into a large room where a spider sits in the middle of a web.
On a shelf that runs around the room Sabor lies wrapped up in web like a fly,
but with his head free.)  
SARAH: No, no!  
(The guard zaps her with his staff, and Lupton smiles.)

**[Barnes' room]**

BARNES: But Lupton may not be dead. Perhaps he can't get back.  
MOSS: For heaven's sake. What's the point in saying the same thing over and
over again?  
KEAVER: But what are we going to do?  
(Mike knocks on the door.)  
BARNES: (sotto) Hide yourselves. (Moss stands behind the door. Barnes turns
off the main light then lies on his bed with a book.)  
BARNES: Come in.  
(Mike enters.)  
BARNES: Oh, it's you. What do you want?  
MIKE: It's all right, I heard you all talking. I think we ought to have a
little chat.  
(Mike steps into the room and Moss knocks him out.)  
BARNES: What you do that for?  
KEAVER: It is a police job now.  
LAND: Stupid thing to do.  
MOSS: Well, you heard him. You heard him! He said he'd been listening.

**[Building]**

(Dawn breaks, and a bell signals the end of the curfew.)  
DOCTOR: Wakey, wakey! Rise and shine! Show a leg, the weather's fine.

**[Cell]**

(Sarah is wrapped in web and lying on the shelf along from Sabor. On the shelf
above is a fully wrapped figure.)  
SARAH: Where am I?  
SABOR: You're a prisoner of the eight legs. It's no good struggling.  
SARAH: What will they do to us?  
SABOR: Usually they eat the sheep we breed for them. They prefer human flesh.

**[Building]**

(The Doctor is eating out of a wooden bowl.)  
DOCTOR: Mmm, this is good. It's very good. What is it?  
ARAK: Mutton broth.  
DOCTOR: Mutton? You have sheep on Metebelis Three?  
ARAK: Our ancestors brought them with them.  
(Rega puts a bowl of bread on the table.)  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
ARAK: But survived the crash.  
DOCTOR: So your ancestors were colonists?  
ARAK: Colonists, explorers. Four hundred and thirty three Earth years ago,
their starship came out of its time jump with no power left, and crashed on
Metebelis Three.  
DOCTOR: Over four hundred years ago? You know the story very well, don't you.  
ARAK: Sabor, my father, taught it me, just as his father taught him, and his
father before.  
DOCTOR: An oral tradition so detailed. It's fascinating.  
TUAR: Look, I don't understand you. That girl, your friend, you say, is a
prisoner of the eight legs, in terrible danger and you just sit there supping
broth and chattering like a woman at the wash place.  
DOCTOR: Oh, Sarah'll be all right for the moment.  
TUAR: Well, how can you tell that?  
DOCTOR: Because the spiders'll be watching her. They'll want to know how she
got here and why.  
TUAR: And meanwhile my father could be killed! We must attack, attack now!  
ARAK: The girl said you could help us, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Mmm. Yes, I think I can. But first of all I must know what we're up
against. How did the spiders get here?

**[Cell]**

SABOR: The eight legs? Why they came from Earth too.  
SARAH: But there aren't any spiders as big as these on Earth.  
SABOR: Keep your voice down, my child. That word's forbidden here. But you're
quite right. An ordinary eight legs, he must have been blown by the wind out
of that crashed ship up in the mountains. There are blue crystals there. They
have strange powers.  
SARAH: Oh, you don't have to tell me that.  
SABOR: Ah, then you must know that these crystals can enlarge the mind. Over
the years, these spiders became cleverer and cleverer and larger and larger.
By the time man found out, it were too late.

**[Building]**

ARAK: And they've ruled us ever since. A few they take and twist their minds
until they become their slaves. The rest of us they rule by fear.  
DOCTOR: I see.  
ARAK: They grew angry with the people of Skorda. They kept too much food for
themselves, so the eight legs wiped them out. Two hundred and sixty-nine of
them, even the children.  
TUAR: They're quite ruthless. We must attack them now.  
DOCTOR: Hmm. Go out and get me some stones, will you?  
TUAR: Stones?  
DOCTOR: Yes, pebbles. You know, about that big. Little pieces of rock. As many
different kinds as you can.  
ARAK: But how can pebbles help?  
DOCTOR: Let's just saying I'm playing a hunch, hmm?  
(Back on Earth, Mike wakes up on Barnes' bed, gagged and with his hands
securely tied behind him.)

**[Building]**

(The Doctor scans the collection of pebbles with the device Sarah got out of
the Tardis.)  
REGA: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Why should the blue crystal be the only mineral on Metebelis Three
with an unusual structure? Now I'm looking for a stone that will absorb the
energy of the spider's attacks. Oh, I do beg your pardon. The eight legs'
attacks.  
(Arak enters.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, more stones. Thank you.  
(The third new stone makes the device give off a high squeal.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, that's more like it. Now we're really getting somewhere.

**[Village]**

DOCTOR: Follow me as soon as you can.  
ARAK: Do you have a stone to protect you?  
DOCTOR: No, I've got something much better than that.  
(The device.)  
ARAK: Take one, Doctor.  
(The Doctor takes the stone from Arak.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, very well.  
ARAK: Good luck.  
DOCTOR: Arak. Tuar.  
TUAR: Yes.

**[Cell]**

SABOR: Even your young muscles aren't strong enough. Try to get some rest.  
SARAH: Rest? How can you be so calm?  
SABOR: One is only frightened when there's hope of rescue. We have no hope
left. We are dead, my child.  
SARAH: No! No, I won't have it. There is hope. There must be. I might be able
to escape and the Doctor may come to our rescue.

**[Spider city]**

(The Doctor is walking along a passage inside one of the towers of the
spider's city.)  
GUARD: Halt!  
(The guard tries to zap the Doctor again, but the device absorbs the energy.
They wrestle briefly and the Doctor drops it. The guard throws him to the
floor, the Doctor reaches for the device and a suede show steps on his hand.)  
LUPTON: Well, what are you waiting for? Kill him.  
(The Doctor hits Lupton's knee. Lupton lifts his foot and the Doctor gets up.)  
LUPTON: Kill him. Kill him now!  
CAPTAIN: Stop!  
LUPTON: Obey my orders.  
CAPTAIN: You will obey me!  
LUPTON: You've got no right to interfere.  
CAPTAIN: I have orders from the Queen. You are to be arrested. Captain, take
him.  
(The guards seize Lupton.)  
LUPTON: You stupid fool!  
DOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn't say that. He's a highly intelligent fellow. You can
tell at a glance.  
CAPTAIN: Silence!  
LUPTON: I shall report this.  
CAPTAIN: You will have your opportunity. Captain, take him to the council.  
LUPTON: No, there must be some mistake.  
DOCTOR: Ah, poor fellow. I hope they won't be too hard on him. He fell into
bad company, you know. Oh well, I must be off.  
CAPTAIN: Stop! Stop!  
(The Captain runs after the Doctor and grabs his shoulder. The Doctor throws
him to the floor then turns to face two more guards.)  
DOCTOR: Oh dear, this is getting monotonous.  
CAPTAIN: Your execution hasn't been cancelled, just postponed. Bring him
along.

**[Cell]**

SARAH: Sabor, how long do you think we've got?  
SABOR: Who knows? A week, a day, an hour.  
(The Doctor enters.)  
SARAH: Doctor! You're alive! I knew you'd come.  
(The Doctor points to two guards behind him.)  
SARAH: Oh, Doctor.

__**Part Five**__

**[Spider's Council Chamber]**

QUEEN: Be silent! You are in no position to protest. Your conspiracy has been
discovered. You and your confederate will die.  
LUPTON: I don't understand.  
SPIDER: They know that we did not bring the crystal to Metebelis. I'm sorry,
Lupton.  
LUPTON: But how did you find out?  
QUEEN: In the same way that we first traced it. By its vibrations through
space and time. The crystal is still on Earth. Do not attempt to deny it.  
LUPTON: Why should I deny it? I know where the crystal is hidden. I told you,
but I didn't say it was hidden on Metebelis. The situation is unchanged. If
you wish to invade Earth, you need my help.  
QUEEN: Be careful, two leg. You may go too far.  
SPIDER: But it's true. Once more, O Queen, your arrogance has endangered the
master plan of the Great One.  
SPIDERS: All praise to the Great One!  
SPIDER: It is not the first mistake the Queen has made.  
QUEEN: Mistake?  
SPIDER 2: Maybe the most noble Queen is growing old?  
SPIDER 3: I think the time has come for a coronation.  
QUEEN: Wait! Wait, my sisters, do not be so hasty. I merely wanted to be sure.  
SPIDER: Then what of the attack on Earth?  
QUEEN: I shall visit the cave of the crystal and ask the approval of the Great
One. Do you hear me? I shall this very day speak with the Great One herself.  
SPIDERS: All praise to the Great One. All praise to the Great One.

**[Cell]**

(The Doctor is trussed up and on the shelf above Sarah, facing the opposite
way so they can see each other.)  
DOCTOR: Well, now I know what a fly feels like. What an absolutely fascinating
experience.  
SARAH: Ha ha. Great.  
DOCTOR: Judging by the habits of our captor's Earth cousins, I would say we're
probably in the larder.  
SARAH: Right first time.  
DOCTOR: I think they'll find I'm rather a tough old bird.  
SARAH: An old boiler, in fact.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, make a good item on the next agenda of the spider council
meeting. Whether to stew a Time Lord or roast him in a slow oven.  
SARAH: That'll give them something to chew over.  
DOCTOR: Yes, something they can really get their teeth into, what?  
SARAH: Hey, Doctor, you know, I'm still not clear what's going on. I mean, if
the spiders wanted that crystal so badly, well, why didn't they just take it
before you did?  
DOCTOR: They didn't arrive until much later. We're in the future remember,
Sarah.  
SARAH: Oh, of course. Huh.  
DOCTOR: Now listen to me, both of you, listen. Arak is trying to get together
some of the men from the other villages. They're going to try a rescue.  
SABOR: But they mustn't! If they do, they're walking into certain death.  
DOCTOR: Ah, no. No, they know how to protect themselves now.  
SARAH: Well how?  
DOCTOR: Well, you see, what  
(Guards enter and he pretends to be asleep.)  
CAPTAIN: The girl.  
(A guard raises a knife above Sarah.)  
SARAH: No!  
(And cuts the cocoon away from her.)  
DOCTOR: Where are you taking her?  
CAPTAIN: Never you mind. You'll find out soon enough. On your feet, girl.  
SARAH: Ooh! Ah!  
(Sarah's legs give way.)  
CAPTAIN: What's the matter with you?  
SARAH: I've pins and needles.  
CAPTAIN: Oh, enough. Come on, bring her.  
DOCTOR: Sarah, try and stall them as long as you can.  
SARAH: You bet, Doctor. I'll do my best to give them all indigestion.

**[Village]**

REGA: I must come with you.  
ARAK: No, Rega. This is man's work.  
TUAR: Why do we wait? We're ready.  
ARAK: Very well then.  
NESKA: Wait. Arak, wait. My husband has been taken from me, must I lose my
sons as well? I've carried you to the fields at my breast, I've dried your
eyes, I've laughed with you through the short years of your boyhood. Now
you're a man. Must you leave me alone to mourn?  
TUAR: But mother, we  
ARAK: We must go, mother. We're not only fighting for Sabor and the two
strangers, we're fighting for ourselves. For the freedom of our people. Rega.
You have nothing to fear. The Doctor has given us protection. Put on the
headbands I gave you.  
(The headbands have a black pebble fastened in the middle of them.)  
ARAK: Are we ready, then?  
VILLAGERS: Yes, we're ready.  
ARAK: Death to the eight legs!  
VILLAGERS: Death to the eight legs! Death! Death!

**[Cell]**

SABOR: You're wasting your time. It's impossible to get out of these things.  
DOCTOR: Look, much as I admire your stoic acceptance of the inevitable, I
would appreciate it if you'd shut up for a moment. What I'm trying to do
requires the utmost concentration.  
SABOR: What are you trying to do?  
DOCTOR: Compress the muscles. It's a little, a little trick I learned from an
old friend of mine.  
(The Doctor has his arms out of the web.)  
DOCTOR: Harry, er, what was his name? Er, Hopkins. No, no, that's not right.
Er, Hetherington. No, that's not right either. It wasn't an English name. Er,
Hackenschmidt. No, I know it began with an H.  
(The Doctor is sitting up and wriggling his legs out.)  
DOCTOR: Houdini. Yes, that was it. Harry Houdini.  
(The Doctor walks across to the cell door.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry, old chap. As soon as I've rescued Sarah, I'll find a
knife and come back for you.

**[Spider Queen's chamber]**

(Sarah is thrown to the floor.)  
QUEEN: Leave us. Leave us, I say!  
(The guard leaves.)  
QUEEN: Rise, child. You have no reason to fear me. I am your friend.  
SARAH: You've a funny way of treating your friends, then.  
QUEEN: You are impertinent! I am going to help you.  
SARAH: Why should you want to help me?  
QUEEN: I do not agree with the plans of the council. The invasion of your
planet is a foolhardy venture. It could destroy us! I have lied to the
council. I have said I will visit the Great One, but  
SARAH: The Great One?  
QUEEN: Never mind. I lied to the council but I had to lie. I desire only peace
with you and all two legs.  
SARAH: Then why have you treated them as slaves?  
QUEEN: It was necessary. Stop fighting me, child. I intend to help you and
your Doctor friend to escape back to Earth.  
SARAH: Well, that's more like it. But why?  
QUEEN: Do you know of the blue crystal?  
SARAH: Yes, your pal Lupton's got it.  
QUEEN: He has not. He left it on Earth!  
SARAH: So that's it. You want me and the Doctor to get it back for you.  
QUEEN: If you do not, I see only disaster ahead for all of us.  
SARAH: And what about Sabor, the old man?  
QUEEN: I shall release him.  
SARAH: And the other, the other two legs on Metebelis?  
QUEEN: I shall listen to their grievance.  
SARAH: And do something about it, like setting them free?  
QUEEN: Very well.  
SARAH: Okay, it's a deal. Now what do I have to do?  
(Meanwhile, the Doctor hides from a pair of guards then continues to walk
through the city.)

**[Barnes' room]**

(Mike is sitting up and trying to free his hands when Barnes enters. Mike says
something through the gag so Barnes removes it.)  
BARNES: Well?  
MIKE: What are you going to do?  
BARNES: Do?  
MIKE: About Lupton. I told you, I overheard you talking.  
BARNES: There's nothing we can do. Just got to wait for him and keep you here
until he comes back.  
MIKE: But as you said yourselves, he may not be able to.  
BARNES: I know. As I said, there's nothing we can do.  
MIKE: Of course there is. Re-establish the link, the contact.  
BARNES: You mean with the mandala and the ceremony?  
MIKE: He's probably waiting for you to do just that.  
BARNES: There are only four of us. You have to have five.  
MIKE: I'll help.  
BARNES: You? Why should you help?  
MIKE: Because of Sarah Jane Smith, of course. I want her back just as much as
you want Lupton.  
BARNES: Yes, yes, of course. But how do I know it's not just some sort of
trick?  
MIKE: Oh, for Pete's sake. Of course it isn't! Come on, untie me.

**[Spider's Council Chamber]**

(Lupton's spider sits in the Queen's place.)  
LUPTON: My plan is this. We shall return to Earth and fetch the crystal from
its hiding place. Then the way will be open for the invasion of Earth.  
SPIDER 2: And what if the Queen returns from the Great One?  
SPIDERS: All praise to the Great One!  
SPIDER 2: I say what if she returns with a different plan?  
SPIDER: The Queen is not to be trusted.  
SPIDER 2: Neither are you. Nor the two leg, Lupton.  
SPIDER: No two leg can be trusted.  
LUPTON: Now, wait a minute.  
SPIDER: Silence! My loyalty is to the eight legs. My loyalty is to this
council. You will listen and obey.  
LUPTON: But it was agreed.  
SPIDER: You have not been made a slave. Let that be your reward.  
LUPTON: You will put my plan into action. I am the one you will obey. I have
the power  
(Lupton clutches his head and falls to the floor in pain.)  
SPIDER: You will obey.  
SPIDER 2: You will obey.  
SPIDERS: You will obey. You will obey. You will obey. You will obey. You will
obey.  
LUPTON: I shall obey. I shall obey.  
SPIDER: Very well. If you cooperate, you will be rewarded.  
SPIDER 2: Now, what shall be our action?  
SPIDER 3: We should invade. This was the plan.  
SPIDER: It must be carried out.

**[Spider city]**

(The Doctor reaches an area that joins with a rough rocky wall with webs in
front of it.)  
SARAH [OC]: Doctor! Doctor, come quickly!  
(The Doctor goes down the rock passage.)

**[Tommy's cupboard]**

(Tommy is still reading aloud.)  
TOMMY: Intelligence as a concept. The simplistic notion that the intelligence
quotient  
(He looks the new word up in a dictionary.)  
TOMMY: Quotient. Result given by dividing one quantity by another. It's no
use. I don't understand the words. I'll have to ask someone what's happened to
me. Yates. He's my friend, I think. I'll ask Mister Yates.

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

(Tommy opens the door.)  
BARNES [OC]: Moss may be in the garden, if he hasn't run away altogether, of
course.  
MIKE [OC]: But we'll meet in the cellar.  
BARNES [OC]: Yes, I suppose so. The sooner we get on with it, the better. I
haven't had a moment's peace since Lupton disappeared.  
MIKE [OC]: Ten minutes.  
BARNES [OC]: If I can find them, of course.

**[Tommy's cupboard]**

(Tommy thinks over what he has heard.)  
BARNES [OC]: I haven't had a moment's peace since Lupton disappeared.  
MIKE [OC]: But we'll meet in the cellar. We'll meet in the cellar. In the
cellar. In the cellar. In the cellar. In the cellar. In the cellar.  
TOMMY: Cellar?  
SARAH [OC]: Lupton has gone down to the cellar. Lupton has gone down to the
cellar. Lupton has gone down to the cellar. Lupton has gone down. Lupton.
Lupton. Lupton. Lupton. Lupton. Lupton. Lupton. Lupton. Lupton.  
TOMMY: Lupton. Clever Lupton!  
(Tommy remembers Lupton appearing out of thin air.)  
TOMMY: Clever Lupton.  
(Tommy gets the crystal from his shoe box.)  
TOMMY: Cho-Je. I'll ask Cho-Je.  
(He hides the crystal in an empty first aid box.)

**[Crystal cave]**

(The Doctor arrives in a cave lit with blue light.)  
SARAH [OC]: Quickly, Doctor! Quickly!  
GREAT ONE [OC]: Stop! If you come any further, Doctor, you will die. Oh, not
at once, but gradually every cell in your body will be irretrievably damaged
by the crystal rays, and I need you alive.  
DOCTOR: I heard the voice of my assistant?  
GREAT ONE [OC]: Have no fear. She is quite safe.  
DOCTOR: But she called out to me for help.  
GREAT ONE [OC]: Like this?  
SARAH [OC]: Doctor, help me! Come quickly!  
GREAT ONE [OC]: No! It is an illusion. Listen.  
SARAH [OC]: Half a pound of tuppenny rice, half a pound of treacle. That's the
way the money goes.  
(Pop.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Goes the weasel.  
DOCTOR: Who, who are you?  
GREAT ONE [OC]: They call me the Great One.  
DOCTOR: Why can't I see you?  
GREAT ONE [OC]: You will, Doctor, you will, all in good time, but not until
you bring me the crystal you stole from Metebelis.  
DOCTOR: But why do you want that particular crystal? It's no different from
all the others.  
GREAT ONE [OC]: Oh, but it is. You took the one last perfect crystal of power.
I searched all time and all space for it. I must have it!  
DOCTOR: No! No, never.  
GREAT ONE [OC]: You are proud, little man. I see that I shall have to teach
you to have respect. Round you go, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: No. No! No, I will not!  
(Against his will, the Doctor turns left, stepping high, as the Great One
laughs.)  
DOCTOR: No! No, I will not! No!  
(The Doctor has turned right round and back to where he started.)  
GREAT ONE [OC]: Is that fear I can feel in your mind? You are not accustomed
to feeling frightened, are you, Doctor? You are very wise to be afraid of me.
Go now. You must hurry back and fetch the crystal. I must have it, don't you
understand? I must have it! I must! I must! I must! Go now. Go! Go! Go now!  
(The Doctor runs back down the rock passage.)

**[** **Cellar]**

(The cabal has been assembled and the chant started. Barnes leads.)  
BARNES: Om mani padme hum.  
ALL: Om.  
(And so on.)

**[Spider's Council Chamber]**

SPIDER: Contact established. The path is open.  
SPIDER 2: The scout soldiers are ready.  
LUPTON: Wait. Where is this contact?  
SPIDER: The place you opened.  
LUPTON: The monastery? Then the group must be operating, but be careful. They
might be hostile now.  
SPIDER 2: Then the approach must be secret.  
(The men continue their chant as a spider stands in the middle of a web design
in the chamber. There is a blue glow and it vanishes.

**[** **Cellar]**

(The chanting gets faster.)  
BARNES: It's not working!  
MIKE: Keep trying!  
ALL: Om.  
BARNES: Om mani padme hum.  
(The spider appears on a sack in a hidden corner of the cellar while the men
chant. A second spider follows it.)

**[Sitting room]**

TOMMY: So I thought I'd better come and tell you all about it.  
CHO-JE: I'm glad you did. Dear me. These foolish fellows.  
TOMMY: But don't you think we should tell K'Anpo?  
CHO-JE: Indeed we should tell the Abbot, when we know what to tell him.

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

CHO-JE: Tommy, you go and get this crystal, and I will go down to the cellar
and see what these naughty chaps are about. Now off you go now.  
TOMMY: Yes, Cho-Je. Cho-Je?  
CHO-JE: Yes?  
TOMMY: You don't seem very surprised to find me changed.  
CHO-JE: When everything is new, can anything be a surprise?  
TOMMY: I see.  
CHO-JE: Hurry now.

**[** **Cellar]**

(The chant is picking up speed again when Cho-Je runs down the stairs.)  
CHO-JE: You must stop!  
(They fall silent.)  
CHO-JE: You are the most misguided of men. Did I not warn you? Did I not tell
you of the risks you ran?  
(A spider dangles from a thread in front of Cho-Je and zaps him.)  
MIKE: No!  
(Mike gets zapped as well. Tommy comes down the stairs to see the spiders
advancing on Barnes. He runs back up.)

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

TOMMY: K'Anpo. I must tell K'Anpo.

**[Cell]**

SARAH: Doctor! Where on earth have you been?  
DOCTOR: Sarah, so you're safe then.  
SARAH: Yes, of course I am. Now listen, Doctor. we're going to escape. Hold my
hands.  
DOCTOR: Look, there's no time for foolish  
SABOR: Listen!  
ARAK [OC]: Sabor! Father! Where are you?  
SABOR: It's my son!

**[Outside the cell]**

(The guard's energy bolt is absorbed by the pebble in the headband.)  
SABOR [OC]: Here, Arak!

**[Cell]**

(Sarah takes the Doctor's hands.)  
SARAH: Quickly, Doctor, or it'll be too late!  
(She concentrates, and they both vanish. Arak and Tuar run in.)  
ARAK: Father!  
(Tuar starts to cut the cocoon.)  
ARAK: Tuar! Behind you!  
(Arak fights a guard.)

**[Village]**

(The Doctor and Sarah appear.)  
DOCTOR: Goes the weasel.  
SARAH: What?  
DOCTOR: How did you manage that?  
SARAH: The Queen taught me. Nothing to it, really.  
NESKA: Stay, girl. Tell us. What has been happening?  
SARAH: Oh, don't worry, Neska. Sabor is safe. Arak and Tuar are rescuing him
at this very moment. Goodbye, and thank you for everything.  
REGA: Can it be true?  
SARAH: Well, come on, Doctor!  
(The Doctor searches his pockets.)  
DOCTOR: The key! I've lost the key!  
SARAH: I've got it.  
DOCTOR: Sarah.  
(The Doctor follows Sarah into the Tardis.)  
NESKA: Wait!  
(The Tardis dematerialises.)

**[** **Cellar]**

(Barnes, Moss, Keaver and Land have spiders on their backs.)  
BARNES: Quickly, hide!  
(The Tardis materialises.)  
SARAH: Doctor, look! Are they dead?  
BARNES: No. An unfortunate oversight, Doctor. It won't occur again.  
(Barnes lets fly an energy bolt which the Doctor and Sarah avoid. The Doctor
uses a stone to absorb the other ones.)  
TOMMY: Quickly, Doctor, this way.  
(The Doctor and Sarah run up the stairs. Tommy gets zapped, but not knocked
out. He follows them.)

**[Outside the cellar]**

(Tommy locks the door.)  
SARAH: But, but what about Mike and Cho-Je?  
DOCTOR: Oh, they'll be out for quite a time. But as long as they're
unconscious, they're quite safe.  
TOMMY: What happened to the others?  
DOCTOR: Oh, they've been taken over.  
SARAH: By the spiders?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
TOMMY: We'd better get out of here.  
SARAH: But, Tommy, you're normal. You're just like everybody else.  
TOMMY: I sincerely hope not.

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

TOMMY: This way.  
DOCTOR: Where are you taking us?  
TOMMY: To the Abbot.

**[Outside the Abbot's room]**

(Inside, the Abbot sits meditating in an armchair.)  
SARAH: Doctor. Doctor, the crystal.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Sarah. All in good time.  
(Tommy knocks on the door.)

**[K'Anpo's room]**

K'ANPO: Come in.  
TOMMY: This is the Doctor, K'Anpo.  
K'ANPO: I know. You are welcome.  
TOMMY: My friend, Sarah Jane Smith.  
K'ANPO: It is kind of you to come and visit an old man.  
DOCTOR: (Tibetan.)  
K'ANPO: You speak Tibetan?  
DOCTOR: A little, sir, yes.  
SARAH: What did you just say?  
DOCTOR: I apologised to the Rinpoche for not bringing him a cotton scarf.  
K'ANPO: You friend knows not only our language but also our customs. The
ceremonial gift merely symbolises friendship. We have no need for symbols, you
and I.  
TOMMY: I think I'd better keep a watch outside. If the others get out of the
cellar  
K'ANPO: As yet they haven't managed it. They may soon, though. Thank you,
Tommy.  
(Tommy leaves.)  
K'ANPO: Pray be seated.  
(The Doctor sits on a stool at the Abbot's feet. Sarah is further away.)  
K'ANPO: Now, Doctor. You have a story to tell me.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I have a strange feeling that you already know most of it.
You see, I found a crystal. A blue crystal.  
K'ANPO: Found?  
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps stole might be a better word. Forgive me. Have we met
before?  
K'ANPO: The recognition of friends is not always easy. Tell me about this
crystal you stole.  
DOCTOR: Well it didn't occur to me that I had stolen it, at the time. You see

**[Outside K'Anpo's room]**

(Barnes and Co arrive under the control of their invisible spiders.)  
SPIDER [OC]: The crystal is in that room.  
BARNES: Get out of the way.  
TOMMY: You can't go in there.  
(Tommy and Barnes stare at each other, and Barnes backs away.)  
MOSS: What are we going to do?  
BARNES: Be quiet. Stand back, you.  
(Barnes zaps Tommy, but he doesn't fall.)  
BARNES: Keaver, Land, get him out of the way.  
LAND: Come on now, Tommy.  
KEAVER: Now!  
(They grab an arm each but Tommy throws them off, then twists Barnes' arm
behind his back before kicking him away.)  
BARNES: No, no!  
TOMMY: Sorry, Mister Barnes.  
BARNES: Kill him!  
(Four sets of energy bolts rip into Tommy.)

__**Part Six**__

**[Spiritual Retreat]**

(Barnes and Co have crowbarred their way out of the cellar and up the stairs.)  
BARNES: We must separate. We must search. He can't have gone far.  
MOSS: No, no, I don't want anything more to do with it. I'm going.  
(But the spider on his back has other ideas. He stiffens in pain.)  
MOSS' SPIDER [OC]: You will stay. You will do as I wish. You will obey me.  
MOSS: Yes, yes, anything. Stop it. Stop it!  
KEAVER: What are we supposed to do?  
LAND: I can see. I can see a blue crystal.  
LAND'S SPIDER [OC]: Yes, we must find the crystal at any cost. Concentrate.
All concentrate.  
KEAVER: I can see it too.  
MOSS: It, it's that way.  
MOSS' SPIDER [OC]: Yes! Yes, we can feel the vibrations. It is near.  
BARNES: Come on then!

**[K'Anpo's room]**

DOCTOR: So you see, the crystal was even more important than I thought. They
want it very badly.  
K'ANPO: Then perhaps they should have it.  
DOCTOR: No, sir, never. Once they get a hold of that crystal, nothing can stop
them taking over the Earth.  
SARAH: Or even the universe itself.  
DOCTOR: Or even the universe itself. I wish I knew where that crystal was at
this moment.  
(K'Anpo takes it from his robe.)  
K'ANPO: Tommy brought it to me. It was the crystal which cured him.  
DOCTOR: Thank heavens it's safe.  
SARAH: Give it to me.  
DOCTOR: Sarah, what's the matter with you?  
SARAH: Give  
QUEEN [OC]: Me the crystal. I must have it. I must! Give it to me!  
DOCTOR: Sarah, what's come over you? (Sarah zaps the Doctor with energy and he
clutches his chest.)  
K'ANPO: Stay!  
(Sarah stands still.)  
DOCTOR: Sarah, what has the Queen Spider done to you? What has she done?  
K'ANPO: It's no use. See through my eyes. Look.  
(K'Anpo puts his hand on the Doctor's, and the Queen Spider becomes visible on
Sarah's back.)  
DOCTOR: Good grief.

**[Outside K'Anpo's room]**

(Tommy is standing guard.)  
SPIDER [OC]: The crystal is in that room.  
BARNES: Get out of the way.  
TOMMY: You can't go in there.  
(Barnes backs away.)  
MOSS: What are we going to do?  
BARNES: Be quiet. Stand back, you.  
(Tommy stands firm, so Barnes zaps him. Tommy staggers but stays upright.)  
BARNES: Keaver, Land, get him out of the way.  
LAND: Come on now, Tommy.  
KEAVER: Now!  
(Keaver and Land grab Tommy's arms, but he throws them off. Barnes lunges for
him and Tommy twists his arm behind his back.)  
BARNES: No, no!  
TOMMY: I'm sorry, Mister Barnes.  
(Tommy kicks Barnes back across the landing.)  
BARNES: Kill him!  
(All four men zap Tommy.)

**[K'Anpo's room]**

DOCTOR: Sarah, listen to me. Struggle against the spider, Sarah. Fight it!  
QUEEN [OC]: I am the Queen.  
K'ANPO: No. You are Sarah Jane Smith.  
SARAH: I, I  
K'ANPO: You are free. You don't have to be dominated. Look into your mind and
see that you are free.  
DOCTOR: Sarah, look at the crystal. Look at it! Look deep into its blue light.  
QUEEN [OC]: No! No! I will not.  
K'ANPO: See that you are free, now.  
QUEEN [OC]: I am the Queen.  
SARAH: No, I'm free. Free.  
QUEEN [OC]: The Queen must live. Help me. I shall die.  
SARAH: I'm frightened!  
DOCTOR: Concentrate, Sarah! Concentrate!  
K'ANPO: You are free!  
(With a cry, the Queen falls from Sarah's back.)  
SARAH: Doctor!  
(Lying on her back, the Queen Spider's legs curl up and she vanishes.)

**[Outside K'Anpo's room]**

(Tommy continues to withstand the energy onslaught.)  
BARNES: Wait. We're not getting anywhere.  
BARNES' SPIDER [OC]: I agree.  
MOSS'S SPIDER 3 [OC]: And I.  
LAND'S SPIDER [OC]: And I.  
BARNES' SPIDER [OC]: We need more power. Concentrate! Concentrate!  
(The four men stand in a circle, with their fingers touching.)  
ALL: Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om.

**[K'Anpo's room]**

SARAH: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: What have you got to be sorry about? You did very well. You should be
proud of yourself.  
SARAH: To let that creature take me over like that. I mean, I actually
volunteered.  
K'ANPO: We are all apt to surrender ourselves to domination. Even the
strongest of us.  
DOCTOR: Do you mean me?  
K'ANPO: Not all spiders sit on the back.  
SARAH: Oh, I don't understand. You're not saying they've taken over the
Doctor, are you?  
DOCTOR: Oh no, Sarah, no. No, he's talking about my greed.  
SARAH: Greed? You?  
DOCTOR: Yes, my greed for knowledge, for information. He's saying that all
this is basically my fault. If I hadn't taken the crystal in the first place.
I know who you are now.  
K'ANPO: You were always a little slow on the uptake, my boy.  
DOCTOR: It's been a long, long time.  
SARAH: You know each other?  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes, he was my teacher. My, my guru, if you like. In another
time, another place.  
K'ANPO: Another life.  
SARAH: Oh, no. Don't tell me you're a Time Lord too?  
K'ANPO: I am. But the discipline they serve was not for me.  
DOCTOR: No. Nor for me.  
K'ANPO: I wouldn't have chosen your alternative. To borrow a Tardis was a
little naughty, to say the least.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I had to get away. I hadn't your power.  
K'ANPO: Indeed. I regenerated and came to Earth, to Tibet.  
SARAH: Regenerated?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, when a Time Lord's body wears out, he regenerates, becomes
new.  
K'ANPO: That is why we can live such a long time.  
SARAH: I see. Well, what about Cho-Je? Is he a Time Lord, too?  
K'ANPO: In a sense. In another sense, he doesn't exist.  
SARAH: You've lost me.  
DOCTOR: Me too, I'm afraid.  
K'ANPO: Cho-Je is a projection of my own self.

**[** **Cellar]**

CHO-JE: Mister Yates. Mister Yates.  
MIKE: Where am I? Oh, that spider.  
CHO-JE: There's not a moment to lose. Come. Come.

**[Outside K'Anpo's room]**

ALL: Om. Om. Om. Om.

**[Spider's Council Chamber]**

(The Spiders are humming.)  
LUPTON: What's going on?  
SPIDER: We are sending power to our sisters on Earth.  
LUPTON: But what about that crystal?  
SPIDER: Be silent!

**[K'Anpo's room]**

(K'Anpo has his eyes shut.)  
SARAH: What's he doing?  
DOCTOR: Shush.  
K'ANPO: As I thought. The moment approaches.  
SARAH: What moment?  
K'ANPO: The moment I have been waiting for. The moment of truth, if you'll
forgive a cliché. The moment of truth for us both. You know what you have to
do?  
DOCTOR: No, I  
K'ANPO: I think you do, my son. What is it you most fear?

**[Crystal cave]**

(The Doctor remembers.)  
GREAT ONE [OC]: Is that fear I can feel in your mind? You are not accustomed
to feeling frightened, are you, Doctor? You are very wise to be afraid of me.

**[K'Anpo's room]**

DOCTOR: Is there no other way?  
K'ANPO: None.  
DOCTOR: Very well. Give me the crystal.  
SARAH: What are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: Take the crystal to the Great One.  
SARAH: But you told me that if you went back there, the cave of crystal would
destroy you.  
DOCTOR: Nevertheless, I have to go.

**[Outside K'Anpo's room]**

ALL: Om. Om. Om. Om.  
BARNES: Enough.  
(They line up again in front of Tommy.)  
BARNES: Now!  
(This time the energy makes Tommy stagger back against the door.)

**[K'Anpo's room]**

K'ANPO: Take my hand. Quickly!  
(The Doctor takes K'Anpo's hand.)

**[Outside K'Anpo's room]**

MIKE: No!  
(Mike runs in front of Tommy and gets zapped. He falls.)  
TOMMY: Yates! Mister Yates!  
(Keaver hits Tommy as the four rush past.)

**[K'Anpo's room]**

SARAH: Doctor!  
(K'Anpo blocks the men's way.)  
MOSS: The crystal. There it is!  
(The Doctor vanishes. Barnes zaps K'Anpo who staggers and slumps back into his
chair.)  
LAND: Where's he gone?  
BARNES: Back to the cellar.  
KEAVER: Come on!  
(Downstairs, the Doctor appears on the mandala. He looks around, then runs
into the Tardis and it dematerialises.)

**[Outside the Spider City]**

(The Tardis materialises and the Doctor steps out.)  
ARAK: Welcome, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Arak. Tuar. Your attack was a success, then?  
TUAR: You can see for yourself.  
ARAK: Thanks to you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Look, I need your help. I want to go into the mountain, into the cave
of crystal.  
TUAR: You will die.  
DOCTOR: Well, nevertheless I have to go. Will you show me the way?  
ARAK: There's more than one way into the caves. Come.

**[Outside K'Anpo's room]**

TOMMY: I think he's dead.  
CHO-JE: Not quite. Carry him to K'Anpo Rinpoche.

**[Spider's Council Chamber]**

DOCTOR: So, you lied. Your attack failed.  
QUEEN: Did you really believe these creatures could overcome the eight legs?
They have minds as easily controlled as their own sheep. Why have you come
back?  
DOCTOR: To return the crystal.  
QUEEN: You have the crystal? Here?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, of course.  
QUEEN: Give it to me.  
DOCTOR: No. I shall return the crystal only to the Great One herself.  
COUNCIL: All praise to the Great One!  
DOCTOR: Is there any among you would dare take it from me?  
LUPTON: I would dare.  
QUEEN: Stop, Lupton!  
LUPTON: Why do you stop me? Everything we've planned, everything we've dreamed
of is there in the palm of his hand.  
QUEEN: We dare not take the crystal. The Great One is all seeing.  
COUNCIL: All praise to the Great One!  
QUEEN: The Great One is all knowing.  
COUNCIL: All praise to the Great One!  
QUEEN: The Great One is all powerful!  
COUNCIL: All praise to the Great One!  
QUEEN: You have beaten us, Doctor. It is good that you will die.  
(Arak and Tuar reluctantly let the Doctor leave.)  
LUPTON: You superstitious fools.  
QUEEN: Be silent, Lupton!  
LUPTON: I will not be silent. I've listened to you for too long. To think that
I've lost my chance of power through a spider! A spider that I could crush
underfoot, without a second thought. A spider!  
(Lupton raises his fist to hit the Queen, so she zaps him.)

**[K'Anpo's room]**

K'ANPO: His compassion protected him, just as Tommy's innocence was his
shield.  
MIKE: Hello, Sarah Jane.  
SARAH: Hi. Hey, we thought you'd had it.  
MIKE: Well, not this time. Oh, I feel fine.  
SARAH: Yeah?  
TOMMY: K'Anpo.  
(K'Anpo looks very tired.)  
K'ANPO: I'm afraid this old body has had it, Miss Smith.  
(K'Anpo's head falls back.)  
SARAH: No!  
CHO-JE: Dear friends, please don't. Please don't  
(Cho-Je vanishes.)  
SARAH: What's happening?  
(K'Anpo becomes Cho-Je.)  
CHO-JE: Please don't. Please don't concern yourselves. I am not dying, merely
regenerating.  
TOMMY: Cho-Je.  
CHO-JE: No, Tommy. I am K'Anpo. Will you put this in your magazine, Sarah Jane
Smith?

**[Crystal cave]**

GREAT ONE [OC]: Stop! Have you brought the crystal to me?  
DOCTOR: Well if I had not, why should I have returned?  
GREAT ONE [OC]: Very well. Very well, advance.  
(The Doctor walks around a corner and sees the universes biggest spider.)  
DOCTOR: I've brought you the crystal. Now why don't you just take it and leave
the humans in peace, both here and on Earth?  
GREAT ONE: You think I care for the puny plans of my subjects? Earth? One
paltry planet among millions? Give me the crystal. I thirst for it! I ache for
it!  
DOCTOR: Well, why is it so important to you?  
GREAT ONE: You see this web of crystal above my head? It reproduces the
pattern of my brain. One perfect crystal and it will be complete. That is the
perfect crystal I need.  
DOCTOR: And then?  
GREAT ONE: My every thought will resonate within the web, and grow in power
until, until, until  
DOCTOR: But you've built a positive feedback circuit. You're trying to
increase your mental powers to infinity.  
GREAT ONE: Exactly! I shall be the ruler of the entire universe!  
DOCTOR: Now listen to me. Listen. I haven't got much time left. What you're
trying to do is impossible. If you complete that circuit, the energy will
build up and up until it cannot be contained. You will destroy yourself.  
GREAT ONE: You waste the little time remaining to you. Even now the cave of
crystal is destroying the cells of your body. I will grant you one last
favour. You may watch the completion of my triumph before you die!  
(The crystal flies out of the Doctor's hand and becomes the keystone of the
web lattice.)  
GREAT ONE: I am complete! Now I am total power! All praise to the Great One!  
DOCTOR: Stop. Stop! Don't you see what's happened to you?  
GREAT ONE: All praise to the Great One! All praise to me! Bow down before me,
planets! Bow down, stars! Bow down, all galaxies and worship the Great One!
The me! The Great, all-powerful me! Argh!  
(The giant spider starts to glow red.)  
GREAT ONE: I hurt! Help me! I am burning! My brain is on fire!  
(The Doctor runs out of the cave.)  
GREAT ONE: Help me!

**[Spider's Council Chamber]**

(The spiders are dying here too.)  
ARAK: The influence is going.  
TUAR: We're free!  
ARAK: Come, my brother.

**[** **Cellar]**

ALL: Om. Om. Om.  
(The spiders die and fall of the men's backs. The Doctor staggers back to the
Tardis and goes inside before the crystal mountain explodes.)

**[UNIT Laboratory]**

BRIGADIER: Hello, Miss Smith.  
SARAH: Oh, hello, Brigadier. I just thought I'd pop in and. Well, to tell you
the truth, I don't quite know why I did pop in, actually.  
BRIGADIER: To see if there was any sign of the old fellow, eh?  
SARAH: Yes. But there can't be, can there? I mean, he's been gone over three
weeks now.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, that's nothing. One time I didn't see him for months. And
what's more, when he did turn up, he had a new face. Could have been a
completely different man.  
SARAH: No. he knew if he went back there he would destroy himself. We'll never
see him again.  
(The Tardis materialises and the Doctor almost falls out of the doorway.)  
SARAH: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Hello, Sarah. I got lost in the time vortex. The Tardis brought me
home.  
(The Doctor steps out of the Tardis and falls onto the floor. The Brigadier
puts a cushion under his head.)  
SARAH: Oh! Oh, Doctor, why did you have to go back?  
DOCTOR: I had to face my fear, Sarah. I had to face my fear. That was more
important than just going on living.  
SARAH: Please, don't die.  
DOCTOR: A tear, Sarah Jane? No, don't cry. While there's life there's  
SARAH: No.  
(She closes the Doctor's eyes. There is a faint buzzing sound, then K'Anpo-
Cho-Je appears, sitting cross-legged in midair.)  
CHO-JE: It's all right. He is not dead.  
SARAH: Oh no. I don't think I can take much more.  
CHO-JE: I am sorry to have startled you, my dear.  
BRIGADIER: Won't you introduce me to your friend, Miss Smith?  
SARAH: Oh, er, yes. This is the Abbot of. No, it's Cho-Je. I mean, it looks
like Cho-Je but it is really K'Anpo Rinpoche. I think.  
BRIGADIER: Thank you. That makes everything quite clear.  
CHO-JE: The Doctor is alive.  
SARAH: No, you're wrong. He's dead.  
CHO-JE: All the cells of his body have been devastated by the Metebelis
crystals, but you forget, he is a Time Lord. I will give the process a little
push and the cells will regenerate. He will become a new man.  
BRIGADIER: Literally?  
CHO-JE: Of course, he will look quite different.  
BRIGADIER: Not again.  
CHO-JE: And it will shake up the brain cells a little. You may find his
behaviour somewhat erratic.  
SARAH: When will all this happen?  
CHO-JE: Well there's no time like the present, is there.  
(Cho-Je aims his fingers at the Doctor, then fades away.)  
CHO-JE: Goodbye. Look after him.  
BRIGADIER: Now wait a moment.  
SARAH: Look, Brigadier. Look. I think it's starting.  
BRIGADIER: Well, here we go again.  
(The silver wavy hair becomes brown wavy hair, and the face becomes younger.
Number Four Doctor has arrived.)
