**Fugitive of the Judoon**  
  
Original Airdate: 26 Jan 2020  

**[Kitchen]**

(A woman watches the hand on her analogue watch tick round, biting her lip.
The toast pops up and she butters a slice to have with her boiled egg.)  
RUTH: Proper.  
LEE: Oh. I said I'd make you your birthday breakfast.  
RUTH: Yeah, well, I was hungry and you were dead to the world.  
LEE: Sorry.  
RUTH: Truckload of presents should make up for that.  
LEE: Yeah, about that.  
RUTH: I'm joking. No presents. Just a cake.  
LEE: Yeah.  
RUTH: You have got me a cake?  
LEE: Yeah, I'm all over the cake.  
RUTH: Mmm. Now there's an image. All right, Monday, Do your worst.  
(They kiss.)  
LEE: Have a great day.  
RUTH: I will.  
(She leaves the apartment block with a smile on her face for all she meets.)

**[Path]**

(Handing out flyers to other pedestrians.)  
RUTH: Whoa. You all right, love? Hello. Hello. Hello, pooch. Have a leaflet.
All right. Thanks. Morning. Have one of these. Thanks. Hi. You all right?
Morning, Reggie.

**[College Green]**

(And takes her position outside Gloucester Cathedral to conduct guided tours.)  
RUTH: Hello, good morning. First time in Gloucester? Try my guided tour. First
time in Gloucester? Is this your first time in Gloucester? Try my guided tour.
This is me. Try my guided tour. I know all the exciting facts about Gloucester
yes, I do. Test me.  
TOURIST: Go on, then. Tell me something.  
RUTH: Okay. In 1216, the cathedral hosted the coronation of King Henry III,
and he was only nine at the time. They filmed Harry Potter here, too.  
TOURIST: (suddenly interested) Oh.  
RUTH: Yeah. Well, plenty more where that came from. Tours start at ten,
twelve, and two.  
(Gives her a flyer.)  
TOURIST: I'll... think about it.  
RUTH: Yeah. She won't think about it.  
MARCIA: No, dear, she won't.  
RUTH: Oh well, never mind. Day's still young.

**[Coffee bar]**

(A dubious looking plastic cup of frothy brown liquid.)  
ALLAN: It's meant to be a heart.  
RUTH: Er, it needs work.  
ALLAN: I know. Man spends his entire life behind a bar, pivoting to the cafe
trade ain't easy, but I try. For you, I'd try anything.  
RUTH: Allan, we've talked about this.  
ALLAN: Oh, I know you're with Lee, but you deserve better.  
RUTH: Oh.  
ALLAN: You know there's something wrong there.  
(He puts a brown folder on the counter, with Lee's photo on the front.)  
RUTH: Is that an actual dossier?  
ALLAN: Yes, on Lee. My Lee dossier.  
RUTH: Oh, come on.  
ALLAN: He hardly talk to anyone, cuts his own hair, gets weird books out from
the library, claims that his family's from round here but I can't find anyone
who knew them. How can you trust that?  
RUTH: Thank you for my birthday coffee.  
ALLAN: Ruth, I'm telling you, I hear things. They don't call me All Ears Allan
for nothing.  
RUTH: It's not a nickname if you give it to yourself, is it?  
(She leaves with the coffee but not the dossier.)

**[Judoon spaceship]**

(Scanner locating target in south-west England, towards the Welsh border. The
Commander enters.)  
JUDOON: Ko Fro Lo.  
JUDOON 2: Bo Fro Sho To. No Bo Ko.  
JUDOON: Mo Lo So. No Kro Do.  
(They fire a beam at the target area.)

**[Tardis]**

RYAN: She's doing it again. Spending hours at the controls looking for
something. Thinks we haven't noticed.  
GRAHAM: I'll ask her. Hey, Doc, what are you looking for?  
DOCTOR: How long have you been there?  
YASMIN: Twenty minutes?  
DOCTOR: You haven't.  
RYAN: What you looking for?  
DOCTOR: Not looking for anything.  
YASMIN: Don't lie to us.  
DOCTOR: The Master.  
GRAHAM: Why would you do that?  
YASMIN: The Kasaavin took him.  
DOCTOR: Yes. They transported him to their dimension and I can't get there in
the Tardis, but I thought if he escaped, I could track him. There's no sign.  
RYAN: I thought he'd be the last person you'd want to see.  
DOCTOR: He left a message for me.  
GRAHAM: Saying what?  
DOCTOR: It's personal.  
YASMIN: Is that where you go, when you leave us to explore and you say you'll
be back in an hour but you never are? Are you out looking for him? Where do
you go?  
DOCTOR: Home. On my own.  
YASMIN: Why? Why not with us?  
DOCTOR: Cos you ask too many questions.  
GRAHAM: Maybe because we're worried about you? I mean, one minute you're all
smiles, next minute your mind's somewhere else.  
(Alarm sounds.)  
JUDOON [OC]: Kro Kro Tro Kro So Fro So So To. Kro Kro Tro Kro (continues under
dialogue)  
RYAN: What is that?  
DOCTOR: A Judoon warning transmission. The cheek.  
YASMIN: Judoon?  
GRAHAM: Are you just saying that to shut us up?  
DOCTOR: Dangerous intergalactic police for hire. Notice of a zonal enforcement
field on Earth. No one can get in or out. What? They're preparing to beam down
there. A platoon of Judoon, near the moon. They can't do that. They've got no
jurisdiction there. Right in the centre of Gloucester. I am not having that.
If I can match the Tardis's rotation to the frequency of the enforcement
field's refresh rate, I might just might be able to slip us in before anyone
gets killed.  
GRAHAM: I thought you said they were the police.  
DOCTOR: Trigger-happy police.

**[Judoon ship]**

JUDOON: Do Po Lo Sho. No Dro Fo Ro. Zo. To Fo Ro. Dro Ro Fro.  
(The squad assembles and comes to attention.)  
JUDOON: Bo. Dro.

**[College Green]**

(The squad beams in to a small street within sight of the Cathedral tower, a
small bridge and College Green.)  
JUDOON: So Zo Ro. To Sho Fro. So Zo To. No Fo Lo.  
(They start scanning people. Ruth watches, worried.)  
JUDOON: No Fo Lo.  
(And stamping the back of their hands with an X.)  
JUDOON: No Fo Bo Bo Lo. Ro. Bo Ro Kro To Fro Bo. Zo.  
(The little old lady confronts a Judoon.)  
RUTH: Marcia, don't!  
MARCIA: How dare you. This is a peaceful, small city. Who even are you?  
(It disintegrates her knitting.)  
JUDOON: Tro Ko Sho.  
MARCIA: That took me nine weeks.  
MARCIA [OC]: That took me nine weeks.  
JUDOON: Language, human.  
(One of the squad hands her a ticket.)  
MARCIA: What's this?  
JUDOON: Compensation for your weapon.  
RUTH: Answer her question. Who are you?  
JUDOON: We are (removes helmet) the Judoon.  
RUTH: Oh... my... God.  
JUDOON: You will be catalogued.  
MARCIA: I will not. Stay away from me.  
(Marcia runs.)  
RUTH: No. Marcia!  
(Marcia runs into a forcefield and gets disintegrated.)  
JUDOON: Enforcement field perimeter at maximum strength.  
RUTH: You killed her.  
JUDOON 2: Category, human. Fugitive match, negative.  
RUTH: What do you want with us?  
JUDOON: All within the perimeter must be catalogued. The fugitive is here.

**[Coffee shop]**

(Lee enters.)  
ALLAN: Well, look who it isn't.  
LEE: I've come to get the cake that I've ordered for Ruth's birthday.  
ALLAN: Oh, got it right here. A special birthday message to her.  
(In green icing - you can do better.)  
LEE: What is the matter with you? Why don't you let it go?  
ALLAN: You want to take this outside?  
LEE: Stop asking me that every time I come in here for a latte.  
(The Tardis materialises nearby.)  
LEE: Humans.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Through here.  
ALLAN: What are you doing in my kitchen?  
DOCTOR: Stay inside and keep the door closed. Do not let anyone in, especially
alien police in helmets and black leather.  
RYAN: The city's under siege. We're going to sort it.  
(Lee bolts for the door.)  
ALLAN: Oh yeah, go on. Get out, coward.  
YASMIN: What is up with him?  
ALLAN: How long you got?  
DOCTOR: No time at all. Stay inside. Lock the door. Come on, gang, no time.  
GRAHAM: No, no, guys. Look at this little lot. Lovely. Look at the state of
that. That's the worst cake I've ever seen.  
(Graham vanishes.)

**[College Green]**

LEE: Ruth, I've been looking everywhere for you.  
RUTH: (frightened) Have you seen?  
LEE: Yeah.  
RUTH: They're aliens.  
LEE: I know, I know.  
RUTH: Real aliens. They killed Marcia.  
LEE: What?  
RUTH: Marcia's dead.  
LEE: We need to get home. Now.

**[Coffee bar]**

(The Judoon turn up just as Allan turns the sign from Open to Closed.)  
ALLAN: Space rhinos? I've got no money. I'm sorry, I'm terrible at this job.  
JUDOON: Category, human. Fugitive match, negative.  
ALLAN: Oh, you're after a fugitive? I can help. He just left. On the counter,
there's a dossier. It's really thorough.  
The Judoon takes the file, sweeping a large mug to the floor and smashing it.)  
ALLAN: Hey, watch it, you big... lunk.  
(He shoves the Judoon.)  
ALLAN: Sorry.  
JUDOON: Assaulting an officer. Sentence, execution. (Allan is disintegrated)
Sentence complete.

**[Apartment]**

LEE: Okay. Need to grab some essentials, a few clothes. We need to go.  
RUTH: What are you talking about? Go where?  
LEE: Do you trust me, Ruth?  
RUTH: Sometimes.  
LEE: You need to just do what I say. Just get some clothes and put them in a
suitcase.  
RUTH: They can't be after you. They're aliens. They've got the heads of
rhinos. You're from Stroud, Lee. (not Guildford, after all?) If there's
something I need to know, you tell me right now.  
LEE: There's no time. Come on.

**[Outside the apartment block]**

JUDOON: Fugitive house unit located. Prepare isolator.  
DOCTOR: I hope you've got a permit for that.  
(She flashes the psychic paper.)  
JUDOON: You're an Imperial Regulator?  
DOCTOR: Yes. And there's plenty here to regulate. For starters, you don't have
jurisdiction here, so why you're using a Class Seven Enforcement Field around
this city bothers me a lot. More importantly, this temporal isolator is an
outlawed piece of kit. Radiation leakage and civilian casualties. Designed to
freeze time but causes horrific collateral damage to anything and anyone that
gets in its path. Horrible thing.  
RYAN: Hey, you're not using that thing here, pal, so consider your rhino
backside imperially regulated. It sounded tougher in me head.  
JUDOON: Fugitive is highly dangerous. Precautions must be taken.  
DOCTOR: Not that weapon, not here. Humans will die, and you, Captain, will
have racked up enough violations to ensure that your troop never get hired
again. Look at you and your platoon of Judoon near the... that lagoon.  
YASMIN: More of a canal.  
RYAN: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: Where's your pride? Where's your respect for the rules? I'm very
disappointed in you. So we will take over from here.  
JUDOON: Negative. Mission must be fulfilled by the contracted troop. Judoon
Engagement Article 163B.  
DOCTOR: That article is overridden by local Earth law... 12, which clearly
states that any potential arrestee is entitled to arbitration with a third
party. Isn't that correct, Liaison Officer Khan?  
YASMIN: Absolutely correct. 100 percent. Rule 12? Massive.  
DOCTOR: Imperial regulation. So you will give us the time to go in there and
arbitrate. That weapon will not need to be used. Clear? Come on. We can sort
this, woman to woman. Give me ten Earth minutes and we can have this resolved
for you.  
JUDOON: Five minutes.  
DOCTOR: Nine.  
JUDOON: Four.  
DOCTOR: Er, fine. I'll take five. I hate it when they do that. We'd best take
the lift. Hang on, where's Graham?  
RYAN: I don't know.  
DOCTOR: Have you lost him?  
RYAN: He's not my responsibility. He's always a few steps behind. I've stopped
checking.  
JUDOON: Four minutes thirty.  
DOCTOR: We haven't started yet. Come on.

**[Spaceship]**

(Graham wakes up on a flat tiled surface in a very large room.)  
HARKNESS [OC]: Don't move. Seriously, not a muscle. Working on the movement
sensors. If you even flinch, it'll set off the laser spikes. Trust me, they
get everywhere. By the way, looking good.  
GRAHAM: Who is this? What's going on? Where am I? And where are you?  
HARKNESS [OC]: Neutralised. Coming to join you. You can get excited now.  
(Captain Jack pops in from thin air.)  
HARKNESS: Ha! You missed me, right? Ha, ha.  
(And gives Graham a big kiss.)  
GRAHAM: Have we met?  
HARKNESS: Still cheeky. Regeneration can't change that. Got to say, loving the
grey at the temple. Kind of distinguished yet still sexy. Oh, come here.  
(Big bear hug.)  
GRAHAM: Whoa.  
HARKNESS: How you been, Doctor?  
GRAHAM: Ah.  
(Be fair, Jack hasn't seen the Doctor since Journey's End...)

**[Apartment]**

(Ruth opens the door.)  
DOCTOR: Pay attention, cos every word I'm about to say is true. There's a
nasty bunch of alien police outside. They're pointing a highly dangerous
cannon at this flat, and they'll fire it in about, er, four minutes. I might
be able to stop them, but I need to understand exactly why they're here, so
you need to let us in, quick.  
(She does.)  
DOCTOR: Right, tell us everything.  
LEE: Who are you? We need to leave.  
DOCTOR: Right into the arms of intergalactic mercenaries who seem to think you
are a fugitive from justice.  
LEE: They've got it wrong.  
DOCTOR: Sure about that?  
LEE: Yeah. It's mistaken identity.  
RUTH: He works at Bathrooms4U, for God's sake.  
DOCTOR: You'd better be telling the truth, both of you, otherwise the Judoon
will have you for harbouring the fugitive, and their justice is brutal.  
RUTH: I'm not harbouring anyone.  
YASMIN: If you're both so innocent, why are your bags packed?  
RYAN: Yeah, like you're about to go on the run.  
DOCTOR: Khan and Sinclair with the key questions. Not that you'll get very
far, given the enforcement perimeter they've just knocked up. Come on, quick
with the truth. We've got about three minutes, probably less. What are you
hiding? Check the flat, see what's here. If it isn't these two, it could be
something inside here.  
RUTH: You're not going through my flat.  
DOCTOR: Yes, they are.  
RYAN: Have you seen those things outside?  
RUTH: Yeah, and I've seen what they do, and that's why we're running.  
(The Doctor scans them with the sonic screwdriver.)  
LEE: What are you doing? What is that?  
DOCTOR: A device that tells me... you're both completely human. Please, I'm
trying to save a lot of lives here, including yours. If you have any idea why
the Judoon are pursuing you, you have to tell me right now.

**[Spaceship]**

(They are being shot at.)  
GRAHAM: What the...? What's happening out there?  
HARKNESS: I guess they want their ship back.  
GRAHAM: What, this ain't your ship?  
HARKNESS: You think I'd choose this look? It doesn't even have a bar. A little
evasive action. Hoping these shields are as good as they say. A few battles
going on around us... You're not just kidding me? You're really not the
Doctor?  
GRAHAM: Oh, no, no. My name's Graham. I just travel with the Doc.  
HARKNESS: Ha! Which is why the scoop read the wrong signal. Ho, ho. Using the
old Quanticum Scoop I got from a fourple on Ibiza 13. Whoo, that was a night.
Actually, that was a month.  
GRAHAM: Well, look, now you know who I am, tell me who you are, why you've
kidnapped me and why you're after the Doc. I mean, we're in the middle of
something right now.  
HARKNESS: Captain Jack Harkness at your service. Me and the Doc, we go way
back. This is important. He needs to know the future of the universe is at
stake.  
GRAHAM: Not he, she.  
HARKNESS: (laughs) Oh. This I gotta see.

**[Outside the apartment block]**

JUDOON 2: Temporal isolator primed, Captain.  
JUDOON: Prepare Final Warning Missile.

**[Apartment]** ]

DOCTOR: Find anything?  
RYAN: A few cash-flow problems, a collection of old phones and keys.  
YASMIN: I found this in the bedroom. Hollow compartment at the back of the
wardrobe.  
(An ornate box. The Doctor scans it.)  
DOCTOR: And that is not from Earth.  
RYAN: So where's it from?  
(Whoosh, glass breaks.)  
RUTH: Oh, my God.  
DOCTOR: What was that?  
RUTH: Just came flying through the window.  
(A red spiky cricket ball in a spiky base.)  
COMPUTER: Isolation of fugitive housing unit in 108 seconds.  
DOCTOR: Doesn't time fly when you don't have all the answers? So, anyone know
what this is?  
(Holding up the box.)  
RUTH: No, I've never seen it before.  
LEE: Me neither.  
YASMIN: We found it hidden in your bedroom.  
DOCTOR: You'd better be telling the truth, cos there's a lot of innocent
people that could die if we don't sort this out quick.  
COMPUTER: 92 seconds.  
LEE: Give me the box.  
COMPUTER: 82 seconds.  
LEE: Give me the box.  
RUTH: Lee? What is that?  
LEE: It's nothing.  
RUTH: No, it clearly is something, cos suddenly you're all bothered about it,
and I've never seen it before in my life.  
LEE: You're in charge, right?  
DOCTOR: It's a very flat team structure.  
LEE: You're the smartest. I can see it in your eyes. Use the fire exit out the
back. Take Ruth. Get her out and make sure she's okay. I can take care of
this.  
RTH: What? No, you can't.  
DOCTOR: What's in the box, Lee? Who are you really?  
LEE: It's none of your business.  
DOCTOR: You've got half of Gloucester under Judoon lockdown. I'm making it my
business.  
COMPUTER: 45 seconds.  
LEE: I can deal with this. Just take Ruth.  
COMPUTER: 40 seconds.  
LEE: Look, I've... I've made a mistake. You're the most important thing in my
life. I can't let others lose their lives. I need to make sure you're safe.  
RUTH: What do you mean, a mistake?  
LEE: I just need to talk to them, okay?  
RUTH: But they're space rhinos, Lee. What are you going to chat to them about?  
COMPUTER: 23 seconds.  
DOCTOR: They'll see us getting out of the fire escape. Unless...  
DOCTOR+YASMIN+RYAN: Diversion.  
RYAN: Look, you take Ruth. We'll go out the front and distract the space feds.  
LEE: You think that'll work?  
RYAN: Come on.  
RUTH: No, cos I'm not going anywhere without Lee.  
YASMIN: I'm a police officer. I speak their language. A bit of stalling, buy
time to get them away. Then we can come inside with them and be by your side.  
LEE: I don't need you to be here.  
YASMIN: You obviously do, because there's a cannon about to fire at your flat.  
COMPUTER: Time limit exceeded. Initiating temporal isolation.  
DOCTOR: We're out of time. It's the best plan we've got for keeping this block
safe. Right, be careful. The Judoon might look dumb, but they're deadly.  
LEE: Go to the cathedral. I'll meet you there, okay?  
RUTH: You better.  
LEE: Not going to miss your birthday, am I? (kiss) Go, go, before they launch
that thing.  
COMPUTER: ..full documentation available on request.  
LEE: See you at the cathedral.

**[Outside the apartment]**

JUDOON: Activate Temporal Blast.  
(The squad wind up the machine.)  
YASMIN: Stop. Arbitration complete.  
JUDOON: Arbitration result?  
RYAN: You can come in now.  
YASMIN: So long as you turn that off.  
JUDOON: Pause isolation. Remain here.  
RYAN: No fugitives in there, by the way.  
YASMIN: And as for you lot, I don't want you using that.  
(Yasmin and Ryan vanish.)

**[Apartment]**

LEE: Keeping my promise.  
(He texts the word Follow. The Judoon break down the door.)  
JUDOON: Surrender. This property now under Judoon jurisdiction.  
LEE: I surrender, okay? You can tell your boss. You... you got me.

**[Spaceship]**

YASMIN: Graham.  
RYAN: What just happened?  
YASMIN: What are we doing here?  
GRAHAM: Short answers. This guy, stolen ship, being fired at.  
RYAN: We need to get back. And who are you?  
HARKNESS: Young. I like you young. But silver fox said, she, not he. So you,
not you, right?  
GRAHAM: I hope you kept the receipt for the scoop.  
HARKNESS: Seriously? Three of you? I had a dream about this once.  
(Crash!)  
HARKNESS: Whoa! Hold on to something.  
(Alarms sound.)

**[Apartment]**

JUDOON: Incoming matter transmission.  
(A humanoid female beams in.)  
JUDOON: Commander Gat, your presence is not required.  
GAT: Could've fooled me. I've been watching it all. You're so noisy. Talk
about sledgehammers to crack a nut.  
JUDOON 2: Presenting occupant of housing unit.  
GAT: Hello, old friend. I see you're back from the dead. We had such a moving
funeral for you. But I suppose that was your intention. Did you really think
that we wouldn't find you? Did you think that I'd ever stop looking? Good
place to hide, mind, the far backside of a tiny galaxy.  
LEE: How did you find me?  
(The box.)  
GAT: Sentiment was always going to be your downfall. You kept it. Silly.
Chronotelluric alloy, strong entanglement. Very trackable. It just takes a
while.  
LEE: Yeah, well, I wanted to repair it, polish it. My service medal. Honour
and courage still mean something.  
GAT: I agree.  
(He puts down the box with the broken medal in it and reaches for the drawer.
She's got there first.)  
GAT: See, this is the problem with our identical training. We share all the
same tricks. Kill him.  
JUDOON: Detained fugitive must be transferred to contracted...  
GAT: No, idiot. You didn't scan him yet, did you?  
JUDOON:Uh huh.  
GAT: Bless.  
(The Judoon scans Lee.)  
JUDOON: Fugitive, negative. Explain.  
GAT: I'm sorry it has to end this way. You got so close to escaping. Faithful
companion.  
(She disintegrates Lee.)  
GAT: Do I have to spell it out for you?

**[Cathedral]**

DOCTOR: All clear. Now, you need to tell me everything you know about Lee. How
long you've been together, and what was that metallic box?  
RUTH: Er...  
(Her phone beeps. Text message - Follow the light. Break the glass. Happy
birthday. X. She gets a flash of West Usk Lighthouse, Gwent, which has Whovian
connections.)  
DOCTOR: Is that from Lee?  
RUTH: No. It's nothing.  
(They start to walk down the Norman Nave away from the choir.)  
JUDOON: This cathedral is under Judoon control. All occupants must surrender
immediately. There will be no escape this time. We have you surrounded.  
(The Doctor and Ruth stand back to back as five Judoon surround them.)  
DOCTOR: How can I help?  
JUDOON: You interfered, Regulator.  
DOCTOR: You know what they say, one person's arbitration is another person's
interference. Very blurry line. This is a place of worship. Show some respect,
or I'll overload those guns and make it a bad day for everyone. Now, let us
go, and nobody needs to get hurt.  
(She is holding out her screwdriver.)  
RUTH: What have you done with Lee?  
JUDOON: Information request granted.  
(It shows her a projection of Lee's death.)  
JUDOON: Sentence, execution.  
DOCTOR: You murdered him. That is a violation of your contract.  
JUDOON: Incorrect. Contract stated retrieval of fugitive. Fugitive identified.  
(The scanner is pointed at Ruth.)  
DOCTOR: What?  
JUDOON: Biological shielding decrypted. Fugitive, positive.  
(Ruth floors all the Judoon very quickly and grabs one of their weapons.)  
RUTH: That's it. Back up or Daddy Rhinoform gets it.  
DOCTOR: Ruth, what are you doing?  
RUTH: It feels like... instinct against the bullies. Cos you know the thing
about bullies? There's always a weak spot.  
(She rips off the Judoon's front horn. That hurts. Then she activates the
communicator on its armour.)  
RUTH: Bo. Ko. Fo. Jo. To.  
(All the Judoon are beamed away.)  
DOCTOR: Do you know what you've just done? Who are you?

**[Spaceship]**

(Still being shot at.)  
YASMIN: You have to get us back there. The Doctor needs us.  
HARKNESS: Listen, kid, working with some low-rent equipment here.  
RYAN: Why doesn't that surprise me?  
HARKNESS: Oh, she likes them mouthy, then, huh?  
RYAN: Yeah, one up from cheesy.  
HARKNESS: Okay, he's my favourite.  
(Bang!)  
HARKNESS: Whoo. Why didn't it scoop her? Why can't I get her here? Argh! Are
there Judoon anywhere near where I scooped you?  
YASMIN: Yeah. A lot.  
HARKNESS: Oh, I knew it. Level Seven Enforcement Fields. That's why I can't
get accurate traces on her. Interfering with everything. Is she safe?

**[Cathedral]**

(Ruth is sitting on the steps up to the altar in the Lady Chapel - I hope. The
Doctor is scanning with her screwdriver.)  
DOCTOR: Total Judoon evacuation. They've even removed the enforcement
perimeter.  
RUTH: That's got to be good?  
DOCTOR: No. Judoon switching strategy means things have got very bad and very
personal now. Ruth, you just dishonoured a Judoon captain, and removing their
horn is the worst insult. I think you know far more than you're telling me
about Lee and about why the Judoon are here. It's time to share.  
RUTH: I don't know anything. I don't even know how I did what I just did to
them.  
(The Doctor scans Ruth.)  
DOCTOR: I don't have the decryption for your bio-shield. You and Lee must have
both had them. Very sophisticated, like biological cloaking.  
RUTH: Look at me. I know my own life. I'm Ruth Clayton. I am 44. I'm married.
I'm a tour guide. And I am scared. Back then... that was not me. My hands,
they just moved. They...  
DOCTOR: Well, if it wasn't you, who was it?  
RUTH: I don't know. I don't understand any of this. None of this is me. It
can't be. Help me.  
DOCTOR: Show me your phone. You received a message just before you turned into
Jackie Chan. (reads) Follow the light. Break the glass. Ruth, I don't think
you are who you say you are or who you think you are. I think there's another
identity hidden within you. Maybe this text is an activation message. Words to
trigger the real you, the instincts that enabled you to attack the Judoon.  
RUTH: No. I'm not that person. I don't want to be that person.  
DOCTOR: I'm afraid you don't have a choice. Do you have any idea what this
means? The light. The glass.  
RUTH: Yeah, I do. I just saw it. But it's just a memory.  
DOCTOR: A memory of what?  
RUTH: The lighthouse where I grew up, my family home. Why am I seeing that
now? I haven't thought about that for years.  
DOCTOR: It's something to do with this message. He had to send it to you
before the Judoon got to him. What did he know? Are you sure it's your home?  
RUTH: Of course I'm sure. I know where I was brought up. My parents are buried
there, on the land outside. I haven't thought about them for years, either.  
DOCTOR: Do you know how to get there?  
RUTH: Course I do.  
DOCTOR: Then we're going, me and you, now.

**[Spaceship]**

HARKNESS: Ship's security is fighting back. You gotta be kidding me. Anti-
theft attack system? Oh. Well, now I'm offended. Look, guys, I'm sorry. I got
get out of here. I got about a minute before the ship's nanogenes attack my
body.  
RYAN: What's going to happen to us?  
HARKNESS: Oh. I'll pre-set the coordinates to get you back. Just tell her
this. I'm going to see her again. Maybe not soon. When she needs me, I'll be
there. In the meantime, tell her beware the lone Cyberman. You don't know what
a Cyberman is yet, do you?  
RYAN: No. What are they?  
HARKNESS: An empire of evil, in ruins right now. Brought down to nothing,
finally. But that could all change if she doesn't listen to this message. To
defeat them, the alliance sent this thing back through time, across space.
Argh! Oh, they are coming for me. Always the nanogenes. Ah! I gotta go. I've
set the scoop for return. It should take you back to where you were. Tell the
Doctor, the lone Cyberman. Don't give it what it wants. At all costs. Tell
her... (he vanishes)  
RYAN: We've lost him.  
YASMIN: Are we stuck here now?  
(The scoop effect flickers over them.)  
GRAHAM: I hope he's got this thing right.  
(They vanish.)

**[Ruth's car]**

(Driving down an unmade track.)  
DOCTOR: Tell me about your parents.  
RUTH: I wish I could tell you I adored them. But they chose to live in a
disused lighthouse. That tells you how good they were with people.  
DOCTOR: Not like you, in the heart of the city, talking to people all day
long.  
RUTH: I guess we all rebel against our parents. It's part of growing up,
innit?  
DOCTOR: Never been a fan of growing up.  
RUTH: They loved it out here. Suited them.  
DOCTOR: Loved it so much they wanted to be buried here?  
RUTH: Yep.  
DOCTOR: You'd moved away by then.  
RUTH: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: But you still own the lighthouse?  
RUTH: Yeah, they left it to me. But I never wanted to come back here to live,
though.  
DOCTOR: When did you move to Gloucester?  
RUTH: Ooo, 1999. Mid-December. Are you testing me?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
RUTH: I don't know why I'm even trusting you.  
DOCTOR: I've got one of those faces. I promise you, I'm your best hope of
finding out who you are and staying alive.  
(Ruth sees a hand texting Follow.)  
DOCTOR: Ruth?  
(The full text message, the fight, the lighthouse.)  
DOCTOR: What are you seeing or hearing?  
RUTH: Nothing. We're nearly there.

**[Lighthouse]**

RUTH: That smell. Home. Forgotten what it feels like to come back here. Like
nothing can touch me.  
DOCTOR: Mind if I take a look around?  
RUTH: Sure. I'll get a fire going.  
(The Doctor goes up the spiral staircase and out onto the walkway outside the
light. She scans the lone gravestone near the parked car, then goes down and
outside to look at it.)  
DOCTOR: Why have a blank gravestone? (scans) Because it's not a grave.  
(Back inside, Ruth is looking at the fire alarm that says - Break glass.
Outside, the Doctor has got a spade and started digging.)  
VOICES: Break the glass and follow the light. Break the glass and follow the
light. Break the glass and follow the light. Break the glass and follow the
light. Break the glass and...  
(Ruth breaks the glass with her elbow and golden energy rushes out from it and
into her. The Doctor is uncovering something. Ruth gets a honking big gun from
a wicker basket, and a change of clothing - a smart suit.)

**[Outside the lighthouse]**

(The Doctor brushes the soil from a sign that says - Police public call box.)  
RUTH: You're probably a bit confused right now. I broke the glass. It's all
come back to me.  
DOCTOR: This. What is this?  
RUTH: That's my ship.  
DOCTOR: What?  
RUTH: Let me take it from the top. Hello, I'm the Doctor. I'm a traveller in
Space and Time, and that thing buried down there is called a Tardis. Time And
Relative Dimension In Space. You're going to love this.  
(Ruth takes the Doctor's hand and they disappear.)

**[Ruth's Tardis]**

(Roundels on the wall! Love the design of this one, far more my taste.)  
RUTH: Come on, old girl. Too sleepy. Power up. Need you right now.  
DOCTOR: Hi. Struggling with this. Can you just...?  
RUTH: No, I can't. Not right now. No time. Just stand there and don't ask
questions. Sorry you got caught up in all this, but if Gat is half the
operative she used to be, she's already figured out here we are. And we need
to be ready, and we're not.  
DOCTOR: Stop. Who's Gat? And who are you, really? Truly.  
RUTH: I told you, love. I'm the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: You can't be.  
RUTH: Yeah? And why's that?  
DOCTOR: Because I'm the Doctor.  
RUTH: You have got to be kidding me. Really?  
DOCTOR: Yes, really.  
RUTH: Since when?  
DOCTOR: Since forever.  
RUTH: And how did I end up like... that? All rainbows and trousers that don't
reach?  
DOCTOR: What? No. How did I end up like you?  
RUTH: You don't. You're in my future, not the other way round.  
DOCTOR: I've never been anything like you. Trust me, I'd remember. Especially
that shirt.  
RUTH: So would I, if I'd ever been you, which I haven't.  
DOCTOR: What?  
RUTH: Huh?  
BOTH: That's not possible. Unless it is. But what would that mean? Doesn't
make sense. Stop doing that! Oh. Same brain.  
DOCTOR: No, this doesn't make any sense. Either I should know you or you
should know me.  
RUTH: Agreed.  
DOCTOR: So why don't we?  
RUTH: I dunno. Why don't you try asking that cute little gizmo of yours?  
(The Doctor takes out her sonic screwdriver.)  
RUTH: Yeah, that's the one.  
DOCTOR: I did. I used it on you, but it couldn't decrypt the bio-shield. If
you've been restored... (scans Ruth then herself) Same person.  
RUTH: Oh, no.  
DOCTOR: But you don't recognise a sonic screwdriver.  
RUTH: Smart enough not to need one.  
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, nothing screams smart like a laser rifle.  
RUTH: I stored that before hiding, cos I knew Gat would come one day, and now
she has.  
DOCTOR: Who is this Gat?  
RUTH: I worked for her once.  
DOCTOR: You've got a job?  
RUTH: Oh, sort of. Not one you apply for, and not one you can ever leave.
Believe me, I tried.  
DOCTOR: You've been hiding on Earth. You used the Chameleon Arch to hide your
identity, to hide your mind, even from yourself. That's why the sonic didn't
pick it up. And Lee was your protector.  
RUTH: Well done. You're only five minutes behind someone who just had their
memory fully restored. Five points.  
DOCTOR: Don't do points. I do points. Points are _my_ thing.  
(Shaking.)  
DOCTOR: Oh.  
(Red energy has grabbed the corners of the buried Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: What's happening?  
RUTH: She's here. The Judoon have got us in a tractor beam, dragging us
onboard their ship. Now listen to me, Doctor. Let me do the talking. Do not
get involved. Because, if you really are me, and Gat figures that, she'll kill
us both.

**[Judoon spaceship]**

(Ruth comes out of the Tardis, rifle ready, and the Doctor follows.)  
GAT: Here we are, then. End of the road. I thought I'd be angry when I saw
you. Turns out I'm just sorry.  
RUTH: Not as sorry as I'm about to be.  
(Judoon approach from behind Ruth.)  
DOCTOR: Ruth, put it down.  
GAT: Yes, Ruth. Do as your little friend says. You are surrounded, after all.  
(Ruth hands the laser rifle to Gat.)  
RUTH: Don't point that thing at me, Gat.  
GAT: This was mine, you stole it.  
RUTH: Mmm, confiscated it. No, really, don't point it at me.  
GAT: Perfect for your execution.  
RUTH: I really wouldn't do that, Gat.  
GAT: Enough now. Let's get off this rust bucket and finish this on my ship.  
DOCTOR: When you say, finish this...  
RUTH: Shut up.  
GAT: Take her advice, little woman.  
DOCTOR: Little? Biting my tongue.  
JUDOON: Contract states Judoon must deliver fugitive to contractee at
Division.  
GAT: I'm here on behalf of the contractee.  
DOCTOR: Hang on, I thought _you'd_ hired the Judoon.  
GAT: Who are you?  
DOCTOR: I'm...  
JUDOON: Imperial Regulator.  
DOCTOR: Sort of. Bit of a fib. Sorry. Actually, I'm...  
RUTH: She's nobody.  
DOCTOR: Fine. I'm nobody. Absolutely nobody. See, I know why you want her.
You've got a contract, fair enough. But you? You want her dead because she
left her job?  
RUTH: Shut up.  
GAT: Is that what she told you? This goes way higher than me.  
DOCTOR: So, who would that be? Who are you all ultimately working for? I'd
really like to know. Really.  
JUDOON: Information confidential.  
RUTH: I told you to keep quiet.  
DOCTOR: And look where that's gotten us. Lots of guns in lots of faces.  
RUTH: And have you got a better idea?  
DOCTOR: I do, actually. My favourite. The curveball and the Judoon. You wanted
to find the Doctor?  
RUTH: Don't you dare.  
DOCTOR: Well, here I am.  
RUTH: Will you be quiet?  
DOCTOR: Go on, scan me.  
(A Judoon scans her.)  
JUDOON 2: Fugitive match positive. (then Ruth) Fugitive match positive.  
RUTH: Is there even a word for how dumb you are?  
DOCTOR: Doctor?  
JUDOON: Subsection 951 triggered. Two fugitives, two payments.  
GAT: There won't be two payments, because two of the same Time Lord can't
occupy the same space at the same time. It's an abomination. It'll destroy the
time streams before you get anywhere near Gallifrey.  
DOCTOR: What did you say?  
(The Doctor scans Gat.)  
DOCTOR: Gallifreyan. You're from home.  
GAT: I serve for the glory of Gallifrey.  
DOCTOR: Then both of you can only be my past. But that's impossible, because I
know my own past. I lived through it. All of it.  
RUTH: You're wrong.  
DOCTOR: I'm not wrong. I've seen Gallifrey destroyed. Twice. First by a war,
second by a lunatic who I'm still trying to find. In my time, Gallifrey
doesn't exist. It's gone. Forever. And if you don't know that, you're in my
past. So, you are only serving at the glory of ash and bone.  
GAT: This is a trick.  
DOCTOR: Check my mind, one Time Lord to another. See what I saw.  
GAT: Keep an eye on her.  
DOTOR: Contact.  
(Image of the destroyed Citadel.)  
RUTH: What did you see? What did she show you?  
GAT: I don't know what trickery this is.  
RUTH: Put the gun down, Gat.  
GAT: But it ends here.  
RUTH: Don't do this.  
(Gat fires the rifle. It backfires, destroying her.)  
DOCTOR: Oh! You knew that would happen. You sabotaged the gun.  
RUTH: I told her not to do it. I begged her not to fire.  
DOCTOR: But you knew she would!  
RUTH: Don't take the moral high ground with me.  
JUDOON: Crime has been witnessed.  
(Ruth picks up the rifle.)  
RUTH: No crime. An accident. And, besides, a Judoonese Talwak Freighter like
this, moving at 80 million clicks an hour, entered interstellar space 12
seconds ago. No one has jurisdiction in interstellar space. So, no laws, and
no crime. Isn't that right, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
RUTH: Recalibrated. Who wants some?  
DOCTOR: The Doctor never uses weapons.  
RUTH: I know. Shut up. We're leaving now. If you know what's good for you, do
not come for me again. Ever. Consider your contract cancelled.  
JUDOON: Judoon contracts will always be fulfilled.

**[Ruth's Tardis]**

RUTH: Homing in near your Tardis signal. Can't get too close. Imagine the
temporal feedback loop. I'll drop you at the docks near my flat. How's that?  
DOCTOR: You can't be me. I know what I've done, I know my own life.  
RUTH: One of us has to be wrong.  
(The Tardis materialises.)  
RUTH: I'd quite like it if you got off my ship now.

**[Gloucester]**

(Walking along the Quay (?) deep in thought.)  
YASMIN: There she is. Doctor! Found you.  
RYAN: Hey, what happened? Where you been? What happened to Ruth? The Judoon
things are gone.  
YASMIN: You're never going to guess what happened to us.  
RYAN: Captain Jack Harkness said hello.  
DOCTOR: What?

**[Tardis]** ]

GRAHAM: Beware the lone Cyberman. Do not let it have what it wants, at all
costs.  
DOCTOR: That's all he said?  
RYAN: Yeah, he got interrupted.  
YASMIN: Who is he, anyway?  
DOCTOR: An old friend.  
RYAN: I liked him. Kind of cheesy.  
YASMIN: But good cheesy.  
DOCTOR: That's Jack. He didn't say any more about the Cybermen?  
GRAHAM: Er, he said that they were a fallen empire and they should stay that
way.  
YASMIN: What are they, these Cybermen?  
DOCTOR: They're one of the most dangerous species I've ever encountered, up
there with the Daleks.  
RYAN: Oh, I can't wait to meet then, then.  
GRAHAM: And they're in our future?  
DOCTOR: They're always somewhere, waiting.  
YASMIN: You haven't told us about Lee and Ruth and the Judoon. Who was the
fugitive?  
DOCTOR: It was Ruth. But Ruth was me.  
GRAHAM: What?  
RYAN: What are you talking about?  
YASMIN: How's that possible?  
DOCTOR: She said she was my past, but I know my past, and she's never been me.  
GRAHAM: I'm sure there's a simple explanation.  
DOCTOR: Time is swirling around me. The Master, Captain Jack Harkness, Ruth.
Something's coming for me. I can feel it.  
RYAN: Let it come. You've got us.  
DOCTOR: Ryan, I've lived for thousands of years. So long I've lost count. I've
had so many faces. How long have you been here? You don't know me. Not even a
little bit.  
YASMIN: Don't talk to him like that.  
RYAN: Yeah, I'm not having that. We do know who you are. You're the woman that
brought us together, the woman that saved us and loads of other people. You're
the Doctor. Whoever you were in the past or are in the future, we know who you
are right now. Right?  
YASMIN: Right.  
GRAHAM: The best person we know.  
YASMIN: And whatever is coming for you, we'll be here, cos we're your mates.  
GRAHAM: Well, not just mates. Family.  
RYAN + YASMIN: Yeah.  
GRAHAM: So, whether you want to go looking for whatever trouble's coming, or
whether you want to wait here and let it come to you, we'll be right here by
your side, like it or not, Doctor.  
(An alarm sounds.)  
RYAN: What's that?  
DOCTOR: I know what you're doing. Siding with them, distracting me. You're
doing this deliberately. Whoa. Multiple alerts across three continents here on
Earth. Can't be connected. Unless they are. Quick look?  
YASMIN: Quick look.  
DOCTOR: Let's go.
