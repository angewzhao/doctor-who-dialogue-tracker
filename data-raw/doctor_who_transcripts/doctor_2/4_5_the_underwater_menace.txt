__**Episode One**__

**[Tardis]**

(Polly has led Jamie from Culloden moor into the Tardis. The doors close and
the dematerialisation sequence starts.)  
JAMIE: What's this?  
DOCTOR: You'll find out.  
JAMIE: Ah, I don't think I want to.  
BEN: It's a machine, my old haggis, which will take us away from Scotland
forever.  
JAMIE: Where to?  
BEN: Ah, well, that as the Doctor would say, that is in the lap of the gods.
We never know.  
JAMIE: Aye, you'd not be leading me on now, would you? Is it a fact you don't
know where we're going?  
POLLY: Quite true, and what's more we don't even know what year it will be
either.  
JAMIE: Ach now, I don't believe it.  
DOCTOR: Nae man can tether time nor tide. Robert Burns.  
(From Tam O'Shanter.)  
JAMIE: Ay? Who's Robert Burns?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I should have remembered.  
POLLY: What?  
DOCTOR: Well to Jamie, its 1746. Robert Burns wasn't born until 1759.  
BEN: Gets sort of complicated, don't it?  
JAMIE: What's happening now?  
BEN: We're just beginning to land.  
DOCTOR: Hold tight, everyone.  
JAMIE: Land?  
POLLY: Don't be scared, Jamie, it's all right really.  
BEN: I get a sort of queer feeling. See we never know what we're going to
find, do we?  
DOCTOR: Ah, that's the fun. Stand by, here we go.  
POLLY: Please let it be Chelsea 1966.  
BEN: Hope it's the Daleks, I don't think.  
DOCTOR: Prehistoric monsters.  
JAMIE: What have I come upon?  
(The Tardis materialises.)  
JAMIE: That wasn't too bad. Let's go outside, Doctor.  
BEN: Yeah, come on, Jamie, you and me first. Well, you never know, you know.  
JAMIE: What?  
BEN: We don't know what's going to be waiting for us out there, do we? Come
on, Doctor, open up.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I don't see why not. It looks all right to me. (The doors open.)
Wait!  
(The Doctor grabs his stove-pipe hat.)  
DOCTOR: For me.

**[Beach]**.

(It's a rocky sea shore.)  
POLLY: This time I'll guess where we are.  
DOCTOR: All right then, where are we?  
POLLY: Cornwall.  
BEN: Ah, you said that last time.  
POLLY: And I was right.  
JAMIE: The Isles, maybe.  
BEN: Don't you know?  
DOCTOR: Haven't a clue. Not the isles of Britain, anyway.  
POLLY: How can you tell?  
DOCTOR: This rock. It's volcanic. It's not very old either.  
BEN: How old?  
DOCTOR: Oh, miocene.  
BEN + POLLY: What?  
DOCTOR: It's only about 25 million years old. Look.  
(Inland, a mountainous peak rises high above them.)  
BEN: Hey, that's an extinct volcano, isn't it?  
DOCTOR: Possibly, possibly.  
JAMIE: Are we not going for a wee look round?  
POLLY: Yes, lets. Come on.  
(Polly, Ben and Jamie head off up the side of the volcano.)  
POLLY: Oh, give us a hand.  
BEN: Here.  
(The higher they go, the steeper the slope. On the beach, the Doctor takes out
his pocket watch and checks the time against the position of the sun)

**[Mountainside]**

(The group stop for a rest half way up.)  
BEN: I don't reckon we're going to see much when we get there.  
POLLY: Ben?  
BEN: What now?  
POLLY: I'm beginning to see things.  
BEN: Where?  
POLLY: Down there, look. I'm sure I saw something moving.  
BEN: Ah, you're round the twist.  
POLLY: Look, there it is again.  
BEN: You see anything?  
JAMIE: Nothing.  
POLLY: Ben, I think we ought to go back.  
BEN: No, not me, I'm having a dekko down here.  
JAMIE: Yeah, me too.  
POLLY: Wait for me!  
(Polly struggles after the men. They stop again just below the summit.) POLLY:
Oh, can't we stop and have a breather?  
JAMIE: Ben and I'll go on. You stay here.  
POLLY: Oh, no.  
BEN: We shan't be long, love, back before you know it.  
POLLY: All right.  
(Polly looks at the view. They are on the largest of a chain of islands, some
no more than large rocks. The ocean surrounds them in all directions. The
sound of falling pebbles lures Polly to a cave entrance a short distance away.
She goes inside. It is dark, but once her eyes have acclimatised Polly sees an
elaborate bracelet on the floor, with a design of a kneeling figure holding a
burning torch. She bends to pick it up and a shadow falls over her. Polly
screams.)  
BEN: Hey, that's Polly.  
(Ben and Jamie run back to where they left Polly.)  
BEN: Polly? Polly?  
(Jamie spots the cave entrance.)  
JAMIE: She must have gone inside.  
BEN: Hang on, I've got a torch.

**[Cave]**

BEN: Polly?

**[Beach]**

(The Doctor has finished his calculations and is looking around carefully in
the rock pools. He finds some shards of pottery.)  
DOCTOR: Mediterranean. Oh no, tidal sea, can't be. That's funny, it hasn't
been fired long.  
(The Doctor puts the pottery into his pocket and goes to find the others.)

**[Tunnel]**.

BEN: Polly?  
(In the cave, Ben and Jamie find a tunnel leading deeper into the mountain.)  
BEN: Polly, where are you?  
JAMIE: Polly?  
BEN: What's that?  
(A weighted net falls onto them and they are pushed into a metal cage hanging
over a pit.)

**[Cage]**

POLLY: Ben, Jamie, is it you?  
BEN: Who do you think it is?  
JAMIE: Are you all right, Polly?  
POLLY: Yes.  
BEN: When you're finished get us out of this contraption.  
POLLY: I can't. They've tied me up.  
JAMIE: Who are they?  
POLLY: I don't know, I didn't see them.  
(The door opens and another person is pushed into the cage with them.)  
BEN: That's all we needed.  
DOCTOR: So they caught you too.  
(The cage lurches and descends. The wind whistles past them.)  
BEN: Left half me stomach behind.  
JAMIE: Aye, me too.  
POLLY: Where are we going?  
DOCTOR: That we shall find out very soon.  
POLLY: Wherever it is it's an awful long way down.  
DOCTOR: Yes, we must be below sea level already.  
JAMIE: It's difficult to breathe.  
BEN: What is it, Doctor?  
POLLY: It's a funny taste. I don't feel very well.  
DOCTOR: Here we are.  
(The Doctor unties Polly.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, don't be frightened anybody. If we pass out it's compressed
nitrogen. It's called caissons disease.  
BEN: Polly, try and get us out of here.  
POLLY: I'll try.  
(Polly struggles with the net, but passes out. The cage reaches the bottom of
the shaft. All four are unconscious as four guards in primitive clothes take
them to a small chamber and lie them out of padded benches to recover.)

**[Chamber]**

DOCTOR: Oh.  
BEN: Where's this? Polly? Jamie?  
JAMIE: Oh.  
BEN: Come on, man, rise and shine.  
JAMIE: Would you disturb the dead.  
BEN: Oh you're not dead, you just got a touch of the submariners', that's all.  
JAMIE: What are they?  
BEN: It'd take too long to explain now. This must be some sort of compression
chamber.  
DOCTOR: Troglodytes.  
BEN: What?  
DOCTOR: Ancient tribes from North Africa who lived in caves. Possibly,
possibly. Where's my diary?  
BEN: Cave men? Hey, Jamie, you better watch it. With that kilt someone might
mistake you for a bird.  
JAMIE: What?  
(Polly wakes, groaning.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, it's difficult to put a precise date on these people.  
POLLY: I don't think it is.  
DOCTOR: All right then, when?  
POLLY: Oh, I'd say about 1970.  
DOCTOR: Can you prove it?  
BEN: Yeah, go on, prove it.  
JAMIE: How d'you know, Polly?  
BEN: Ah, she's been studying her crystal ball.  
POLLY: Abracadabra.  
(Polly produces the bracelet she found.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, how interesting, yes. Hmm. It's Aztec. Fake of course.  
BEN: Mexico Olympiad.  
POLLY: When we first left Earth it hadn't happened yet.  
BEN: No, that's right, it wasn't due till 1968.  
POLLY: Right, so now is any time later than that.  
JAMIE: Later? Oh, I wish I understood.  
(The door opens. A guard carrying a trident enters.)  
BEN: Polly, you speak foreign. Go and talk to him. Ask him where we are.  
POLLY: Er, parlez-vous francais? Sprechen Sie deutsch? Habla si espanol?  
GUARD: Bazumi tampost postu!  
JAMIE: Au Gaelic akye?  
BEN: What's that?  
JAMIE: Gaelic.  
(The guards prods them to the door with his trident.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that means move in any language. I think we'd better
comply. Women and children last. Polly?

**[Reception area]**.

(Guards line the corridor to the small room where a table is being laid with
food. The Doctor tries some.)  
DOCTOR: Oh food.  
(The guard raises his weapon to hit the serving girl, so the Doctor
accidentally gets in the way.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so sorry. Thank you.  
(The girl smiles and leaves hurriedly.)  
DOCTOR: This is good.  
(The guard leaves by another door.)  
DOCTOR: This is very good. Mmmm. It's delicious. This is excellent. Sit down,
sit down. This is ambrosia.  
BEN: What's got into him?  
POLLY: I don't know. I've never seen him go for food like this before. It's
usually hats.  
JAMIE: Better hurry or he'll scoff the lot.  
(But they don't share his enthusiasm for the cuisine.)  
BEN: What is it?  
DOCTOR: Plankton.  
JAMIE: Plankton? What's that?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's small plants and animals from the sea.  
POLLY: Animals?  
BEN: Yeah, little spidery ones.  
POLLY: Oh, I don't think I'm very hungry, thank you.  
DOCTOR: You'd better get used to it. I don't expect there's much else to be
had around here. Visitors!  
(A striking figure in splendid robes sweeps into the room.)  
DOCTOR: Good day to you.  
(He is a priest, and is accompanied by guards.)  
RAMO: We've been expecting you.  
POLLY: He speaks English.  
BEN: What does he mean, he's been expecting us? We didn't know we were coming
ourselves.  
RAMO: The living goddess Amdo sees and hears all.  
DOCTOR: And she had a message about us? For you?  
RAMO: Yes. She told us you would fall from the sky in time for our festival of
the vernal equinox.  
DOCTOR: And just what part are we to play in this festival of the vernal
equinox?  
RAMO: A very important part, I regret to say. Guards.  
(There's a scuffle.)  
DOCTOR: No! Wait! I have something important to say.  
RAMO: Be quick and say it then.  
DOCTOR: I won't speak under threats!  
RAMO: You have five minutes in which to make your point. After that you will
join your companions. The ceremony will proceed.  
POLLY: Doctor?  
RAMO: Go, girl.  
DOCTOR: What will happen to them?  
RAMO: They will come to no harm. Yet.  
DOCTOR: You'll have to go, Polly.  
(The guards take Ben, Polly and Jamie away.)  
RAMO: Now, stranger, say what you have to and do not waste time. There is very
little of it left for any of you.  
DOCTOR: What I have to say concerns a certain Professor Zaroff.  
RAMO: What do you know of Zaroff?  
DOCTOR: A great deal. He's here, isn't he?  
RAMO: How did you know?  
DOCTOR: The food. It couldn't be anyone else but Zaroff. He led the field in
producing food from the sea. His progress is astonishing.  
RAMO: You are a friend of Zaroff's?  
DOCTOR: Just send him this message, and you'll see.  
(The Doctor takes out a pencil and paper.)  
RAMO: I will take no message to Zaroff.  
DOCTOR: You're making a big mistake!  
(The serving girl returns.)  
RAMO: Yes, what is it, Ara?  
ARA: I've come to clear the table.  
RAMO: Yes, yes, we've wasted enough time.  
DOCTOR: Ara, take this message to Professor Zaroff.  
ARA: But I

**[Temple of Amdo]**

(It is a cavernous space with a vaulted roof supported by carved pillars cut
from the rock. There is a large idol of the goddess, a fish-woman hybrid. Her
altar is lit by burning braziers and tended by priests. In the centre is a
platform with four beams radiating out from its centre. Polly, Ben and Jamie
are dragged before the altar.)  
POLLY: I'm scared. What are they going to do to us?  
JAMIE: I don't see the Doctor here. He's escaped, maybe.  
BEN: Ah, some chance of that.  
JAMIE: Oh, he's a canny one, yon Doctor. Dinna fash yourself, Polly.  
RAMO: Quiet! You profane the sacred temple with your idle chatter.

**[Outside Zaroff's laboratory]**.

ARA: I must speak to Professor Zaroff.  
(The guard shakes his head.)  
ARA: Well, Damon then.

**[Temple of Amdo]**

JAMIE: Ben, should we run for it?  
BEN: No, wait till we hear from the Doctor.  
POLLY: It'd be better.  
(Acolytes bind them hand and foot then hoist them up and carry them to the
platform. The priest removes a cover to reveal a deep well and shark infested
waters below. Ben, Polly and Jamie are laid on the beams so their heads are
together at the centre, pointing towards the well.)  
JAMIE: Put me down.  
POLLY: Ben? The Doctor isn't coming!  
BEN: Don't worry. As long as he's not here, there's still some hope.  
(Ramo escorts the Doctor in.)  
BEN: Oh, no.  
(The Doctor is led to the dais.)

**[Surgeon's lab]**

(Ara has been allowed to see the Chief Surgeon.)  
DAMON: Well, girl, what do you want? Why are you not at your work?  
ARA: I have a note for Professor Zaroff. It's very important.  
DAMON: A note for Zaroff? Let me see. Oh, come, girl.

**[Temple of Amdo]**

(The beams are held in place by ropes fastened to earthenware jars full of
water as counterweights. The High Priest puts on the fish mask and speaks.)  
LOLEM: Life is a stream of water that drains away even as time does, and
cannot be reclaimed.  
(A boy removes a stopper from each jar.)  
LOLEM: Accept, oh mighty and powerful Amdo, these, your sacrifices.  
(As the water flows from the jars, the beams start to tilt down into the shark
pool.)  
POLLY: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Hold on! Hold on for your lives.

**[Zaroff's laboratory]**

(There is a scorpion fish in a tank.)  
DAMON: Here is the note.  
(It reads 'Vital secret will die with me' and is signed Doctor W. Zaroff
crumples it)

**[Temple of Amdo]**

(The water continues to come out of the jars and the travellers slide slowly
down the beams. Polly screams.)  
DOCTOR: Don't move. Don't even breathe.  
(Zaroff runs in.)  
ZAROFF: Stop the ceremony!  
RAMO: You dare to interfere with the hour of sacrifice?  
ZAROFF: I do not interfere with your sacrifices, but I must first speak with
that man. Release him.  
RAMO: Release him.  
(Acolytes obey and help the Doctor to his feet.)  
ZAROFF: Now, this information you have, what is it?  
DOCTOR: First, release my friends.  
ZAROFF: I do not care about your friends. Your information, quick!  
DOCTOR: But I do. Professor Zaroff, if anything happens to them, you'll never
know the secret I was going to tell you.  
ZAROFF: You! All right, release them. Take them to the labour controller. He
will know what to do with them. Well, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: First, let me say how glad I am to see that the reports of your death
twenty years previously are a little premature.  
ZAROFF: The whole world believed I had been kidnapped.  
DOCTOR: The East blamed the West. The West, the East.  
ZAROFF: Oh, I wish I could have been there.  
DOCTOR: Now here you are, the greatest scientific genius since Leonardo, under
the sea. You must have a fantastic story to tell?  
ZAROFF: Perhaps I tell you someday, if you will live long enough to hear. Now
this vital secret, what is it? I must know.  
(The Doctor makes sure that the others have been taken away.)  
DOCTOR: I haven't got one.  
ZAROFF: How dare you!  
DOCTOR: But I'm sure a that great man like you wouldn't want a modern
scientific brain like mine to be sacrificed to a heathen idol?  
ZAROFF: You know I could have you torn to bits by my guards, yes?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
ZAROFF: I could feed you to my pet octopus, yes?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
ZAROFF: Well you have sense of humour. I too have sense of humour. I need men
like you. (both laugh) You come with me, yes?  
DOCTOR: I come with you.

**[Operating theatre]**

(Jamie, Ben and Polly have been put in Damon's custody.)  
DAMON: Your lives have been spared. See that they contribute useful service to
the community.  
BEN: Anything you say, mate.  
DAMON: What was that?  
BEN: Oh, nothing, nothing.  
DAMON: You men look strong. You'll be sent to the mines. Take them away.  
BEN: What?  
JAMIE: What does he mean, mines?  
BEN: Now wait a minute. Now what are you going to do with her?  
POLLY: Yes, what?  
DAMON: I shall decide that later.  
(Jamie and Ben are dragged out.)  
JAMIE: Don't lose heart, Polly!  
DAMON: Don't be afraid, girl. Life is very beautiful under the sea. Come
along.  
(A shutter slides up to reveal the seabed lit by floodlights. Shadowy figures
swim to and fro.)  
DAMON: Seventy percent of the world's surface is under the oceans. You are
looking at our food producing area. Without it, we couldn't survive.  
POLLY: It's fantastic. What are those?  
DAMON: Those are our farmers.  
POLLY: I think it's splendid. All those people working under the sea to feed
the others. But listen, how do they breathe?  
DAMON: We give them plastic gills. Look.  
(One of the fish people swims close to the window, peering in.)  
DAMON: That surprises you, doesn't it?  
POLLY: It's breathtaking. Oh, sorry. That wasn't meant to be a pun.  
DAMON: No, not at all. No, I'm glad you're taking it like this. Some people
get most upset when they find they're to have the operation.  
POLLY: Operation?  
FOREMAN: Well, of course. We couldn't send you out there without it. You'd
drown.  
POLLY: You're not turning me into a fish!

**[Corridor]**.

DOCTOR: Just give me a clue, Professor.  
ZAROFF: West of Gibraltar, south of the Azores. The Atlantic ridge, what does
that suggest to you?  
DOCTOR: Ancient temples under the sea. But that's not possible! That's only a
legend.  
ZAROFF: Go on, go on, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: We're on the ancient kingdom of Atlantis.  
ZAROFF: Yes, yes, and this is not the perfect place to complete my work?  
DOCTOR: But how did you get them to accept you? Surely science is in
opposition to ancient temple ritual and idol worship?  
ZAROFF: I gave them a sugar-coated pill. I have promised to lift Atlantis out
of the sea.  
(A guard is waiting.)  
ZAROFF: Yes, what is it? Pardon me, Doctor.  
ARA: Doctor? Doctor?  
DOCTOR: What is it, Ara?  
ARA: It's the girl. They're going to carry out the fish operation on her.  
DOCTOR: Fish operation? Well, well, well. Ara, do you know where the main
fuses are?  
ARA: Fuses?  
DOCTOR: Oh, never mind. Go back to Polly, and if the chance comes, get her
away from there! Will you do that for me?  
ARA: Yes.  
ZAROFF: Doctor!

**[Operating theatre]**.

(Polly has been dressed for surgery.)  
POLLY: Keep away!  
DAMON: Bring her here.  
(She is dragged to the operating table.)  
DAMON: Don't be difficult, girl, it's quite painless. Lights.  
POLLY: No! no!  
DAMON: We're ready now.  
POLLY: No! No! No! No! No! No!  
(Damon looms over her with a huge hypodermic syringe.)  
DAMON: One tiny jab, and you'll know nothing more about it until it's all
over.

__**Episode Two**__

**[Zaroff's laboratory]**

ZAROFF: And so you see, my friend, it is all so simple. When Atlantis was
submerged at the time of the flood, some life continued in air pockets in the
mountain's caves, thanks to the natural air shaft provided by the extinct
volcano.  
(The Doctor has a pair of wire-cutters behind his back.)  
ZAROFF: You like my laboratory, yes? You find all this very impressive, no?  
DOCTOR: No, not a bit, not a bit.  
ZAROFF: What do you mean?  
(The Doctor backs up to a power distribution panel, wire-cutters at the
ready.)  
DOCTOR: I expected nothing less from the great Professor Zaroff.

**[Operating room]**

(Before Polly can be injected.)  
DAMON: The lights are playing up again. Go and see what's wrong. No, wait. I'd
better go myself. Zaroff might listen to me. Look after the girl.  
NURSE: Right.

**[Zaroff's laboratory]**

ZAROFF: Yes, we have come a long way in our research, and luckily the riches
of Atlantis have provided ample means.  
(He goes over to his pet octopus tank.)  
ZAROFF: Ah, so you are hungry today? Did I forget to feed you? Is beautiful,
no?  
(Damon enters.)  
DAMON: Zaroff!  
ZAROFF: Not now, Damon. Can't you see I am talking with my friend here.  
DAMON: This won't wait. If I am to operate on the girl, I must have light.  
ZAROFF: One operation, one girl. You are making an unnecessary fuss.  
DAMON: I know what's going on. You're using so much voltage on the project
that all civil use is curtailed.  
ZAROFF: Ridiculous. I will show you. You follow me. Open the panel.
Ridiculous. There is nothing wrong with the civil supply. There's never
anything wrong. Look, the supply to your clinic is always adequate and cannot
be affected by demands elsewhere.  
DAMON: Zaroff!  
ZAROFF: The fault must lie at your own intake.  
DAMON: It's easy to make excuses.  
ZAROFF: Excuses! Who taught you, Damon? Everything you know, I've taught you.
As I made you, so I can break you.

**[Operating room]**

(The room is plunged into darkness.)  
NURSE: So Zaroff will listen to him. You'd better go and get some light from
somewhere. You'll find some in the old quarters. Don't worry, prisoner, we
won't keep you waiting long. Ah, you, girl, come here. Keep watch on the
prisoner while I search for fuses. And don't try any tricks, understand, or it
will be worse for you.  
ARA: I understand.  
(The two men leave, and Ara starts unstrapping Polly from the operating
table.)  
ARA: Girl?  
POLLY: What?  
ARA: Don't speak, just follow me.  
POLLY: But I can't see anything.  
ARA: Hold my hand. I'm used to the dark. Hurry, before they get back.

**[Zaroff's laboratory]**

(The Doctor's tampering has been noticed. He steps away from the power supply
panel.)  
DOCTOR: I can't think of how I came to be so clumsy. I must have bumped into
it.  
DAMON: You're not clumsy, Doctor. You did it on purpose. But you won't save
the girl.  
(Damon leaves, and the Doctor tries to follow.)  
ZAROFF: Oh no, Doctor, you are staying here with me.  
DOCTOR: As your prisoner?  
ZAROFF: Let us say as my guest.

**[Tunnel]**

ARA: It's all clear, come on.  
POLLY: Oh, I feel as though I've run a hundred miles. But where?  
ARA: I know where to hide you. Come on.

**[Zaroff's laboratory]**

ZAROFF: Damon? Ha, he's just an Atlantean, a primitive. Clever, but no vision.  
DOCTOR: Professor, you have offered these people a very big sugar-coated pill
to make them accept you, yes?  
ZAROFF: I turned their dreams and prophecies to my own means.  
DOCTOR: The dreams of a people living on a drowned continent must be.  
ZAROFF: To lift Atlantis from the ocean. Make it dry land again.  
DOCTOR: Exactly. But now, how are you going to do it? Even a genius like you.  
ZAROFF: Look. Atlantis underwater.  
(Zaroff shows the Doctor a model of the city in an aquarium tank.)  
DOCTOR: A very large mass to lift.  
ZAROFF: If I can't lift it then I must lower the water level. You see the
valve there?  
DOCTOR: Yes, may I?  
ZAROFF: Please.  
(The Doctor pulls the plug from the tank.)  
ZAROFF: Simple, isn't it?  
DOCTOR: Yes, but you haven't got a drain big enough to take an ocean.  
ZAROFF: Then I will make one.  
DOCTOR: You'll forgive me. I'm a little lost. The crust of the Earth is more
than a hundred miles thick. Below that is believed to be a white-hot molten
core. Now where is your ocean going to go?  
ZAROFF: That is my secret.  
DOCTOR: Oh, now you're making fun of me, Professor.  
ZAROFF: No, no.  
DOCTOR: Even supposing you could drill to the depth of a hundred miles.  
ZAROFF: There is a place where a fissure reduces the distance to less than
fifteen miles.  
DOCTOR: It's still an enormous obstacle.  
ZAROFF: But not insurmountable. We have been working on it for many years.  
DOCTOR: Even if.  
ZAROFF: Excuse me, I have been interrupted.  
(Holding up a bag of food, Zaroff returns to his pet octopus.)  
DOCTOR: But Professor?  
ZAROFF: Yes?  
DOCTOR: Even supposing you succeeded, you know what will happen, don't you?  
ZAROFF: You tell me, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Well, the water will be converted into superheated steam, the pressure
will grow, and crack the crust of the Earth. Destroy all life, maybe even blow
the planet apart.  
ZAROFF: Yes. And I shall have redeemed my promise to lift Atlantis from the
sea. Lift it to the sky! It will be magnificent.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
ZAROFF: Bang! Bang! Bang, bang! That's all.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Just one small question. Why do you want to blow up the world?  
ZAROFF: Why? You, a scientist, ask me why? The achievement, my dear Doctor.
The destruction of the world. The scientists' dream of supreme power!

**[Mine]**

(Deep below the city. The drills make a high pitched screech that hurts the
ears.)  
FOREMAN: Only four loads today? You'll have to increase output or you'll be
joining our fish friends. All right, get on with it.  
(A guard brings Jamie and Ben.)  
FOREMAN: I've another two for you. All right, this way, follow me.  
(They go over to where two workers are talking and not working.)  
FOREMAN: What's this?  
SEAN: Huh?  
FOREMAN: Slacking?  
SEAN: (Irish, of course) Oh, I'm sorry I can't hear a word you're saying.
Splitting with the noise.  
FOREMAN: What have you got there?  
JACKO: Who, me?  
FOREMAN: Guard!  
(Jacko palms off a small object to Sean.)  
FOREMAN: Search that man.  
(Unseen, Sean throws it to Jamie, who hides it in his plaid.)  
GUARD: Nothing here.  
FOREMAN: Search the other.  
(Sean is ticklish, and giggles.)  
GUARD: Nothing on this one either.  
FOREMAN: All right, this time you're lucky. These two have just joined us.
Teach them to be useful.  
(The foreman leaves with the guard.)  
JACKO: That was close. What is it?  
(Jamie gives it back to Sean.)  
BEN: What's the secret about a compass?  
SEAN: It's as important as eyes down here. Thanks, chum. If they had found
that on us we'd have been for the high jump, I tell you.  
JAMIE: Why d'ye pass it on to me though? Suppose they'd caught me with it?  
SEAN: Well, they didn't, did they?  
BEN: Are you planning something, then?  
SEAN: That's our business.  
JAMIE: What's the matter with you? Are we not all in the same boat?  
JACKO: That's right, Jock, and we don't want no one to rock it.  
JAMIE: The name happens to be Jamie and I'll just thank you to  
SEAN: Take no notice, he's a bit like that, you see.  
BEN: Hey, watch it. That guard's looking this way.  
SEAN: Oh, well, make out we're working.

**[Zaroff's laboratory]**

(Zaroff his checking his assistant's work.)  
ZAROFF: Your calculations cannot be correct. Let me see.  
DAMON: Professor?  
ZAROFF: Not now, Damon. Come with me.  
DOCTOR: Ah, Mister Damon, you're back. Did your operation go well?  
DAMON: The girl escaped.  
DOCTOR: Oh dear. How very frustrating for you.  
DAMON: We'll get her back.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes of course you will.  
(The Doctor goes to a workbench and examines the bottles of chemicals there.)  
DOCTOR: It's very important to you, isn't it? I mean, you want all the human
labour you can get, don't you?  
DAMON: Yes. But it's cheap and plentiful. We pick up survivors from shipwrecks
who would otherwise be corpses, and convert them to fish people.  
DOCTOR: Amazing. The Professor leads the field in scientific discoveries. What
a fantastic conception. To control the world from a test tube.  
DAMON: That's right.  
DOCTOR: Well, two can play at that game. Have you ever seen this?  
(The Doctor picks up two test tubes and pours one into the other. It releases
a gas and Damon starts coughing.)  
DAMON: Stop him, stop him. Don't let him get away.

**[Temple of Amdo]**

ARA: You understand, you must hide on Amdo and wait until I can fetch you.
Don't be worried.  
POLLY: Yes, but.  
ARA: And don't make a sound.  
POLLY: No, all right.  
(Ara leaves, and Polly starts climbing the idol to find somewhere to hide.)

**[Mine]**

(It is time to eat - plankton again.)  
BEN: Don't you ever get sick of this seafood?  
JACKO: You learn to live with it.  
SEAN: Just watch it though, they haven't found any way of keeping it fresh. In
a few hours it's putrid.  
JAMIE: Tell me, why do you need a compass?  
SEAN: Oh, there's no point in making a break without one, is there?  
JACKO: Why don't you shout it out to the guard?  
BEN: Look, mate, do yourself a favour and stop treating us as if we're one of
them. Look, Jamie and I don't intend to stop here either.  
SEAN: See, I told you. Now come on boys, will you cheer up?  
JACKO: All right, all right.  
BEN: How do you intend going about it?  
JAMIE: Aye, how? There're guards all over.  
BEN: Well, come on, give.  
SEAN: Right. Well, while I was mining a shaft, I came along the entrance to a
little underground tunnel like this, you see?  
BEN: I see.  
JAMIE: Where does it lead, though?  
SEAN: Well, we haven't been able to explore it. We'll just have to take a
chance. Now if we go, there'll be no turning back. You understand?  
JACKO: We make it or we don't.  
SEAN: Are you with us, then?  
BEN: Yeah, count me in.  
JAMIE: Aye, when do we go?  
JACKO: When the chance comes.  
SEAN: And we jump fast, do y'hear me?  
(The Foreman comes over.)  
FOREMAN: They need extra labour up at the project. You two join the lineup for
selection.  
(He moves away.)  
BEN: Now's our chance. We're off.  
SEAN: By Christopher, you're right. If we disappear now they'll think we're
gone to the project work gang. Okay, Jacko?  
JACKO: Oh, it'll give us a start anyway.  
BEN: Right, now look, you go first, Jacko. That'll show Jamie and me where the
entrance is. Then you go, Sean.  
JAMIE: And then you, then me.  
(A whistle sounds.)  
SEAN: Scatter.  
(The workers form a line, with Sean and Jacko at the far end. Then Jamie joins
it.)  
FOREMAN: Right. You, you, you.  
JAMIE: How about me, sir?  
FOREMAN: You're too new. Get out of my way.  
(Jacko has already made his escape before the Foreman turns back to the line-
up.)  
FOREMAN: You, you.  
BEN: I volunteer, sir.  
FOREMAN: Too new.  
BEN: Oh, but sir.  
FOREMAN: Go and join your friend.  
(Sean has used the distraction to leave too.)  
FOREMAN: You.  
(Jamie joins the line-up again to conceal Ben leaving.)  
FOREMAN: I thought I told you to get out of my way.  
JAMIE: Oh aye, sir, I'm just going, sir. (Jamie follows Ben.) Thanks, boys.  
(Jamie grabs a torch and goes around the miners to the secret tunnel where the
others are waiting.)

**[Tunnel]**

BEN: Come on, man. We haven't got all day.  
JACKO: Took a long time, didn't he.  
BEN: Yeah.  
SEAN: Is that you?  
JAMIE: Aye.  
BEN: Well come on, hurry up.  
SEAN: And bring the light.  
JAMIE: All right.  
BEN: Look, suppose this don't lead any place, and we want to come back?  
SEAN: Oh, you won't mate. They'll kill runaway workers on sight.

**[Corridor]**

(The guards are searching for the Doctor and Polly.)  
GUARD: We'd better try the small chamber.  
(The guards move off and the Doctor comes out of a cupboard. He looks at the
clothes inside it. They are guard uniforms. He tries on one of the hats.)

**[Chamber]**

GUARD: Nothing here. The compression chamber next.  
(Ara enters.)  
GUARD: Seen any strangers, girl?  
ARA: No, sir, nobody.  
(The guards leave and the Doctor enters.)  
DOCTOR: Ara? No, wait, Ara. It's me.  
ARA: Oh, it's you.  
DOCTOR: Where's Polly?  
ARA: Safe. I'm taking her some food and clothes.  
DOCTOR: Good girl, well done. Ara, where can I find your Chief of State?  
ARA: In the council chamber, why?  
DOCTOR: I want to talk to him. Can you take me to him?  
ARA: Yes, but he'll hand you over.  
DOCTOR: I'll have to take that risk.  
DAMON [OC]: Stay outside.  
(The Doctor and Ara hide behind a pillar as Ramo and Damon enter, leaving a
guard outside the door.)  
DAMON: Keep your eyes skinned for escaped prisoners.  
RAMO: Well, where are the others now?  
DAMON: The two young men are at the mine. The girl is still at large, and so
is the Doctor. But we'll find them. They cannot get away.  
RAMO: Now what does Zaroff think about it all?  
DAMON: Oh, he's furious, of course. Could upset his plans.  
RAMO: He should not have interfered with the temple sacrifice.  
DAMON: You've always hated him, Ramo. Why?  
RAMO: He's a destroyer. He appeals to all that is base in our people. He
should never have come to Atlantis.  
DAMON: But without him, Atlantis will never rise again from the sea.  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Can you get Damon away? I want to talk to the priest alone.  
ARA: I'll try.  
(Ara comes out of hiding.)  
ARA: If you please?  
RAMO: But not to the same extent.  
ARA: Master?  
DAMON: Yes, yes?  
ARA: I believe I have seen the girl you are looking for.  
DAMON: Where?  
ARA: Down by the market.  
DAMON: Show me.  
(Ara and Damon leave, and the Doctor comes out.)  
DOCTOR: Can I have a word with you, Ramo?  
RAMO: Doctor! Damon!  
DOCTOR: We're both on the same side, Ramo. You distrust Zaroff out of
instinct. I distrust him because I know the truth.  
RAMO: Why should I trust you?  
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. I wish I could think of a good answer.  
RAMO: All right, tell me what you know.  
DOCTOR: Can we talk here?  
RAMO: I know a place where we shan't be interrupted.

**[Tunnel]**

(The men come to a junction.)  
JACKO: Yeah, which way now?  
BEN: This-away, or thataway?  
SEAN: Oh, one is as good as the other.  
JAMIE: Well, let's try fifty paces up each tunnel, then turn back.  
BEN: Yeah.  
JAMIE: Jacko? Oh, I suppose I'll go with you. We'll take the high road.  
JACKO: Oh, let's go then.  
BEN: Which leaves us with  
BEN + SEAN: The low road.

**[Temple of Amdo]**

(Polly has fallen asleep in the shadows of the idol and doesn't wake as Ramo
and the Doctor enter.)  
RAMO: Come this way. We shall not be interrupted here. Now, tell me what you
found out about Zaroff.  
DOCTOR: He says that he's going to raise Atlantis, yes? That's not quite true.
He intends to destroy Atlantis.  
RAMO: A difficult task.  
DOCTOR: It's easier than raising it.  
RAMO: How will he destroy us?  
DOCTOR: He intends to drill a hole through the earth's crust, and drain away
the ocean, yes?  
RAMO: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Have you any idea what will happen if he does that? I'll show you.  
(The Doctor fills a small pot with water.)  
DOCTOR: May I?  
(He seals the lid and places it over a brazier.)  
DOCTOR: This pot is the earth. This is the ocean. The ocean drains into the
earth. Now, but the centre of the earth is hot, far hotter than this fire. So
what happens?  
RAMO: But this is child's play. What has this to do with Zaroff's project?  
DOCTOR: This pot is Zaroff's project. Watch. Now the pot begins to boil, but
the steam can't get out, and so. I think we'd better stand a little further
back. Get down!  
(Bang! As the pot blows apart under the pressure of the steam.)  
DOCTOR: This is what will happen. Zaroff intends to raise Atlantis, but in
little pieces.  
RAMO: You swear this is true?  
DOCTOR: Well, I thought I might mention it. Of course, if you don't mind being
blown up.  
RAMO: Can you stop him?  
DOCTOR: Could I? I am not the ruler of Atlantis.  
RAMO: If I took you to our ruler Thous, could you convince him?  
DOCTOR: I might.  
RAMO: Wait here.  
(Ramo leaves. The Doctor pulls out his recorder and plays.)

**[Tunnel]**

BEN + SEAN: Thirty eight, thirty nine, forty.  
BEN: Well, what beats me is why Atlantis hasn't been discovered before.  
SEAN: Oh, maybe it has, but nobody got back home to tell the tale.  
BEN: Oh yeah, could be. Hey.  
(They flatten themselves against the wall then jump out on a passing person.)  
JACKO: Hey! It's me.  
SEAN: I'm sorry. You can't be too careful these days.  
BEN: Yeah, but where's Jamie? He went with you.  
JACKO: He's gone on, I came back to collect you and Sean.  
BEN: Now what do we do. We're not even at the end of this one yet.  
SEAN: I think the best thing to do is you go back to Jamie ,and I'll go on and
meet you in ten minutes.  
BEN: Oh yeah, but where?  
SEAN: Where? At the, er, at the fork. Okay?  
BEN: Right.

**[Temple of Amdo]**

(Ramo returns.)  
RAMO: Put this on, could you?  
(He gives the Doctor a cloak.)  
DOCTOR: Could I?  
RAMO: With these robes, no one will challenge you.  
(The Doctor is very taken with the headdress.)  
DOCTOR: How do I look?  
RAMO: What?  
DOCTOR: Never mind.

**[Tunnel ledge]**

BEN: Jamie!  
JAMIE [OC]: Here.  
BEN: Jamie!  
JAMIE: Down here!  
(Jamie is below them, hanging on for grim death to an outcrop of rock.)  
BEN: Okay, mate. We're with you. Are you hurt?  
JAMIE: No, but watch it. The rock's slippery.  
BEN: Don't worry about us. Just cling on.  
SEAN: How far down is he?  
BEN: About ten feet, I'd say.  
SEAN: What's that in metres?  
BEN: Why don't you get further along there. (Ben lies down and tries to reach
out to Jamie.)  
BEN: Can you reach it? Try again. Right. Now the other hand.  
(Jamie moves his weight to his other hand and manages to reach Ben's fingers.
Jacko hangs onto Ben's legs as he reaches down with his other hand. As Jamie
grabs it, the extra weight makes Ben slide forward.)  
BEN: Oh, Jacko!  
JAMIE: I think I've got a foothold now.  
BEN: All right.  
(But he can't climb up, so Ben and Jacko have to pull Jamie onto the ledge.)

**[Temple of Amdo]**

(Polly wakes and climbs down the idol.)  
POLLY: Huh. You needn't think I'm afraid of you, you stupid thing.  
(A hidden door opens in the base of the statue and she hides in the shadows.)  
SEAN: Come on, quietly.  
BEN: Blimey, look where we are.  
JAMIE: Back at the temple.  
SEAN: There's somebody down there.  
POLLY: Boo.  
BEN: Ah, it's Polly! All right.  
JAMIE: Polly!  
JACKO: You know her?  
BEN: Yeah, of course I do. She's one of our lot.  
POLLY: What happened to you?  
BEN: We found a tunnel in the mines that lead into this idol.  
JAMIE: So here we are.  
BEN: What's this rigout in aid of?  
POLLY: They were going to turn me into a fish.  
BEN: Into a fish?  
POLLY: It's not funny!  
SEAN: I'm Sean, this is Jacko.  
JAMIE: Have you seen the Doctor?  
POLLY: Not since he went off with Professor Zaroff. Why, haven't you?  
BEN: No, but I'd love to know what he's up to.

**[Council chamber]**

DOCTOR: Ramo, this ruler of yours, is he  
RAMO: His name is Thous. He believes Zaroff to be the deliverer of Atlantis.  
(Thous enters.)  
THOUS: Good evening, Brothers of the Temple. Please be seated. What is this
important business you want to tell me about?  
RAMO: Most excellent Thous, this is a matter of life and death. Under no other
circumstances would I have brought a stranger to you in temple garb.  
THOUS: A stranger? Who are you?  
DOCTOR: A man of science.  
THOUS: Science? Ah, I see. One of Professor Zaroff's colleagues. Perhaps we
should ask him to join us.  
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, I wouldn't do that if I were you. In fact, I wanted to
speak to you alone, Excellency.  
(Ramo moves away.)  
THOUS: Well, speak.  
DOCTOR: Excellency, the Professor is a wonderful man.  
THOUS: Wonderful?  
DOCTOR: A worker of miracles.  
THOUS: Indeed, you speak the truth.  
DOCTOR: But, have you noticed his eyes lately?  
THOUS: No.  
DOCTOR: When he talks of his project, have you noticed his eyes? They light up
like this!  
THOUS: What does this mean?  
DOCTOR: The Professor is as mad as a hatter.  
THOUS: Mad? Zaroff?  
DOCTOR: Completely. No answer. It's sad.  
THOUS: I do not understand.  
RAMO: We believe Zaroff to be working toward the destruction of Atlantis, not
it's resurrection.  
THOUS: I have heard such words from you before, Ramo.  
RAMO: This man has proved it to me. Zaroff's plan will split the world in two.
This is not the action of a sane man.  
THOUS: But your own priests proclaimed him to be the prophet who would raise
us above the sea.  
RAMO: Lolem. He is old and superstitious.  
THOUS: And your superior, Ramo. Remember that!  
DOCTOR: So you will not listen to us?  
THOUS: I did not say that. I have heard your arguments.  
DOCTOR: We've only just begun.  
THOUS: I have heard enough. Now leave me, and I will consider what you have
said.  
RAMO: I know you will choose well, for all our sakes.

**[Temple of Amdo]**

ARA: Oh, I'm sorry I'm so long. Here's some food.  
JAMIE: Ah, food.  
POLLY: And clothing. Super. Thanks, Ara. Look at this! Listen, why are you
doing all this for us?  
ARA: You were kind to me, and I hate Zaroff.  
JAMIE: You hate Zaroff?  
ARA: We are not all his slaves. He will find out one day.  
SEAN: Let's hope we find out soon. Do you want all that food for yourself,
Ben? Come on.  
BEN: Oh, sorry. Look, Ara, have you seen anything of the Doctor?  
ARA: Yes, I'll take you to him later.  
BEN: What's that?  
ARA: Oh, quickly, you must hide. They're coming.  
JAMIE: Back where we came from, Ben.  
BEN: Right, the safest place in the whole of Atlantis.  
SEAN: There's no need to be afraid, girl.  
(Ara looks at the idol in fear.)  
POLLY: Aren't you coming with us, Ara?  
ARA: No, I must stay here. I'll be missed.  
JAMIE: Are you two going to remain here all night? Come on.  
(Ara slips away as the four go into the hidden chamber.)

**[Council chamber]**

(The Doctor and Ramo are summoned.)  
THOUS: I have given much thought to your words, and I have come to a decision.
There is your answer.  
(The doors are thrown open to admit Zaroff and his guards.)  
THOUS: Do with them what you will!

__**Episode Three**__

_(From the Lost in Time DVD)_

**[Thous' room]**

ZAROFF: So you're just a little man after all, Doctor, like all the rest. You
disappoint me.  
DOCTOR: You disappoint me, Professor. I didn't think a man of science needed
the backing of thugs.  
ZAROFF: Have a care, Doctor. Your life is in the balance.  
DOCTOR: What, you mean you haven't told your own people what's in store for
them? Are you afraid, Zaroff?  
ZAROFF: I have made a mistake. If I had not interfered with the temple
sacrifice, the sharks would have torn you apart. But it's not too late. I'll
return you to Lolem and tell him I need you no longer. And he can have that
stupid priest as makeweight.  
DOCTOR: No. You've no quarrel with Ramo. I persuaded him to help me. I'm the
one to blame.  
RAMO: That is not true. I have always distrusted you, Zaroff.  
ZAROFF: Take them away!  
RAMO: The curse of Amdo be on you!  
ZAROFF: Goodbye, Doctor. Have a pleasant journey.  
DOCTOR: Let's not say goodbye, Professor. We'll be seeing each other again.  
ZAROFF: Not in this world, Doctor.  
(The Doctor and Ramo are taken away.)  
ZAROFF: As always, there is nothing to worry about.  
THOUS: And there is no truth in this man's arguments?  
ZAROFF: The man is a fool. Have I not sworn to you that Atlantis shall rise
again from the sea? Haven't I? Haven't I? What are you staring at?  
(Thous is looking into Zaroff's eyes.)  
THOUS: Nothing. Nothing at all.

**[Temple of Amdo]**.

(The priests enter in their seaweed robes. The Doctor and Ramo are stood
before two beheading blocks.)  
DOCTOR: What happens now?  
RAMO: First the supplication, and then  
(He looks at a masked man with a large sword.)  
LOLEM: Accept, oh powerful and mighty Amdo, these your sacrifices.  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry I got you into this, Ramo.  
RAMO: We all have to die sometime, Doctor. If it is the will of Amdo, it is
inevitable.  
(Their necks are forced down onto the blocks. But just as the headsman raises
his sword, a shrieking sound comes from the mouth of the idol. Everyone stops
and stares.)  
VOICE: This is the voice of Amdo. Hear me. Bow down your heads that Amdo may
accept your sacrifice. Bow. Let no human eyes witness this awful moment.  
(All but the Doctor kow tow.)  
DOCTOR: (sotto) I know that voice.  
(The secret door opens and Ben beckons to the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Ramo. Don't be afraid. Get up and follow me. Come on.  
(They run forward and duck behind the altar as Lolem looks up.)  
VOICE: He who looks on the living face of Amdo shall die.  
(The Doctor and Ramo get inside the secret door. The idol screams again.)  
LOLEM: A miracle! A great and powerful miracle! Amdo has eaten up her victims!

**[Secret room]**

RAMO: Unbelievable. All these years and I never guessed Amdo's secret.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I thought I recognised the voice. How on Earth did you manage it?  
POLLY: This is linked to the back of Amdo's mouth. It's a bit old but it
works.  
DOCTOR: It was the sweetest sound I've ever heard in me life.  
POLLY: Thanks, Doctor.  
BEN: Keep your voices down now, or they'll hear us.  
POLLY: No, they won't, I've put the bunghole in.  
RAMO: So Amdo was made to trick her worshipers.  
DOCTOR: Ben, how did you find this place?  
BEN: Oh, we found it by chance. A tunnel in the mines leads straight here.  
DOCTOR: Jamie!  
JAMIE: Doctor. That's Sean, that's Jacko.  
(It turns out that Sean is blond and Jacko is dark-skinned.)

**[Council chamber]**.

ZAROFF: So I tell you, it's complete. Everything will be ready in two days
from now.  
THOUS: To think that after so long the great day is at hand. We shall surprise
the whole of mankind.  
ZAROFF: Yes. A very great surprise. Perhaps the greatest ever.  
THOUS: I shall order special prayers today.  
ZAROFF: Why not? It will keep the people happy.  
LOLEM [OC]: Let me in!  
THOUS: What is the meaning of this, exalted Lolem?  
LOLEM: A miracle, mighty Thous, before our very eyes!  
ZAROFF: Tell us.  
LOLEM: Mighty Amdo, goddess of land and sea, has accepted the sacrifice of the
priest, and the little Doctor.  
ZAROFF: Indeed. What a miracle.  
LOLEM: They vanished into air before they could be beheaded.  
ZAROFF: No. Disappeared, you say? How?  
LOLEM: They were in our midst and we bowed our heads in prayer. When we looked
again they'd gone.  
ZAROFF: You lie, Priest. You allowed them to escape, no?  
THOUS: You discredit the mystic power of Amdo?  
ZAROFF: I believe what I see with my own eyes.  
THOUS: The truth, Lolem.  
RAMO: I tell you, the voice of Amdo spoke to us.  
ZAROFF: Ha.  
LOLEM: The little Doctor no longer lives.  
THOUS: You're certain?  
LOLEM: By the spirit of Amdo, by the all-beating heart of living Atlantis.  
THOUS: Perhaps he is right. It is a miracle. You may go.  
ZAROFF: Yes, go. And pray to Amdo that you are right.  
LOLEM: May the wrath of Amdo engulf you!  
ZAROFF: I'll take my chance. Get out!  
(Lolem leaves.)  
THOUS: Is it wise to sow seeds of doubt by discrediting a miracle just now?  
ZAROFF: Yes. If the Doctor is at large, he can be an even bigger danger. We
must search the whole of Atlantis for him.  
THOUS: But Lolem has said  
ZAROFF: Maybe Lolem can raise Atlantis again from the sea with his prayers?  
THOUS: Give your orders, Zaroff. It shall be as you wish.  
ZAROFF: Now you are talking sense again.

**[Secret room]**.

POLLY: The point is, where do we go from here?  
BEN: Yeah, where?  
JAMIE: Aye, tell us, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Our course is plain. We must attack Zaroff. He has gone mad, and he's
bent on destroying the whole world. We've only a short while in which to stop
him.  
SEAN: Well, just tell us what to do.  
DOCTOR: Food.  
SEAN: You're hungry, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
SEAN: Hungry?  
DOCTOR: No, I mean Zaroff and his people cannot exist without food.  
RAMO: But there's always plenty of food for everyone. The sea is all around
us. The supplies are unlimited.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but who provides it?  
RAMO: The fish people do.  
DOCTOR: The fish people! Exactly. And why? Because they are slaves. But
slaves, like worms, can be made to turn.  
POLLY: Right. So if you organise the fish people to cut off the supplies. Yes,
but that's no good. Then they'll just go and live off their stocks.  
DOCTOR: Tell them, Ramo.  
RAMO: We have no stocks of food.  
DOCTOR: Exactly. Zaroff has not yet found the answer to his great problem. All
his seafood goes bad in a few hours, and has to be thrown away.  
RAMO: That's true.  
DOCTOR: And so  
BEN: I get it, we get the fish people to go on strike.  
JACKO: Oh, you are dreaming, man.  
SEAN: Now hold on a minute, we could try right enough.  
POLLY: Yes, but what would that do for us?  
DOCTOR: What would it do for us? I don't know, really, but it's a start. Do
you think you can do it?  
SEAN: Well, we'll have a go, Doctor, but it'll take a great gift of the gab to
win over the fish people, you know?  
DOCTOR: But you are Irish.  
SEAN: Well, come on, laughing boy. Tell me, how can we contact you?  
DOCTOR: We make this place our headquarters. If nobody's here, just leave a
message.  
POLLY: Good luck.  
JACKO: Oh, we'll need it.  
(Jacko and Sean leave.)  
BEN: What are we going to do?  
DOCTOR: Kidnap Professor Zaroff!

**[Market]**

(Polly and Ara look around the fish people's market. Polly is in local clothes
now, a sea-shell bodice and seaweed skirt, and decorative headdress. The
Doctor has a headscarf and cloak, and playing his recorder, rather like a
gypsy.)  
DOCTOR: Are you all right?  
POLLY: Yes, super. Look what I've got on.  
DOCTOR: You look splendid.  
POLLY: Better than you do. Couldn't you find a better disguise than that?  
DOCTOR: What's wrong with it?  
POLLY: You look like a sailor.  
DOCTOR: That's what I'm supposed to be.  
(A fish woman comes past with a large basket.)  
POLLY: No, thank you.  
(Polly takes a drink from a fountain.)  
POLLY: Salt water.  
DOCTOR: What do you expect? This is Atlantis. Now you know what to do?  
POLLY: I think so.  
DOCTOR: Wait a minute. Something's gone wrong. Where's Zaroff?  
POLLY: Looking for us.  
(Guards come through the market. Ara conceals Polly as they try to avoid
them.)  
ARA: Back this way. Nola, we need your help.  
NOLA: (a stall holder) Guards?  
POLLY: They're looking for me.  
NOLA: Lie down.  
(She covers Polly with a rug and Ara sits on her.)  
GUARD: Have you seen any strangers about, old woman?  
NOLA: Everyone's a stranger these days. Why don't they stay away and leave us
in peace?  
GUARD: What have you got here?  
(Another guard goes to jab the rug with his trident. Nola grabs it.)  
NOLA: How shall I sell my carpets if you stick holes in them?  
(The guards leave.)  
NOLA: It's clear.  
ARA: Are you all right?  
POLLY: Yes. Thank you very much.  
NOLA: Don't waste time, girl. Get away while you're safe.  
(Polly and Ara leave. The Doctor rattles his tambourine and sits by the
fountain. Jamie and Ben enter in wetsuits, like Zaroff's guards wear.)  
JAMIE: Zaroff's on his way, close behind us.  
BEN: Hey! Did you see anyone come through the market place?  
DOCTOR: A man?  
BEN: Yes.  
DOCTOR: About five foot nine?  
BEN: That's right.  
DOCTOR: Black coat, baggy trousers and a bow tie?  
BEN: Exactly.  
(A guard walks straight past.)  
DOCTOR: No. As a matter of fact I haven't.  
BEN: You fool.  
JAMIE: He's gone. We'd better get in position.  
BEN: Right.  
DOCTOR: Polly!  
(Ara takes the Doctor's place at the fountain.)  
ZAROFF: Where's that man who has been a moment ago?  
ARA: What man, sir?  
ZAROFF: Answer me, girl.  
ARA: I don't know.  
ZAROFF: Guard! Search over there.  
GUARD: Sir!  
ZAROFF: You two come with me.  
(Ben and Jamie give nazi salutes and follow Zaroff.)  
DOCTOR: Zaroff!  
ZAROFF: There he is! There he is! Stop that man!  
DOCTOR: Zaroff!  
(Mayhem as everyone runs around. The Doctor runs out with Zaroff, Ben and
Jamie following him.)

**[Passageway]**

ZAROFF: That man, which way did he go?  
(Polly keeps her face down and points along the passageway. She joins in the
train behind Jamie.)

**[Temple of Amdo]**.

RAMO: Is all well?  
DOCTOR: Splendid. He's close behind me. I hope I haven't set too hot a pace
for him. No. Here he comes.  
(Ramo kneels in front of the idol as the Doctor hides. Zaroff enters with Ben
and Jamie.)  
ZAROFF: He must be here somewhere. Search the temple.  
BEN: Yeah.  
ZAROFF: Who has entered here, priest? Ah, the renegade priest himself. Guards,
take him!  
(Zaroff pushes Ramo into the arms of Ben and Jamie. He finds the Doctor behind
a pillar.)  
ZAROFF: Ah, Doctor, at last.  
(The Doctor blows powder into his face from a blowpipe. Ben and Jamie pounce.)  
BEN: Right, to the back with him.  
ZAROFF: Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me!  
POLLY: Doctor, now that you've got him, what are you going to do with him?  
DOCTOR: You'll see. Come on.  
(They all go into the secret chamber behind the idol.)

**[Cliffside]**

(Fish people are relaxing on the rocks, looking like Galapagos iguanas.)  
JACKO: Go on, tell them.  
SEAN: Tell them what? I tell them nothing. They're not people like us, they're
just a bunch of sardines. You heard me. Cold-blooded fishes. You haven't got a
drop of good red blood in your body.  
(The fish people don't like that.)  
SEAN: A flatfish from Galway would have more guts in them than that bunch.  
(The fish people throw pebbles and shells.)  
SEAN: (laughs) You wouldn't hurt a little child.  
JACKO: What would they do?  
SEAN: I'll tell them. All right, all right, all right. Oh, calm down and
listen. Listen, will you? Look, you supply all the food for Atlantis, right?
It can't be stored, right? It goes rotten in a couple of hours. That's why
Zaroff has you working like slaves night and day, right? Well, has it never
occurred to your little fish brains to stop that supply of food? Feed
yourselves but starve Atlantis, eh? What do you think would happen then? Well
now is your chance. Will you do it, or will you stay fish slaves for the rest
of your lives? You're men, aren't you? Well, start the blockade right now.  
JACKO: Do you reckon they will do it?  
SEAN: Who knows? We can only hope for the best.  
(The word is spread underwater.)

**[Secret chamber]**

ZAROFF: I have underrated you, Doctor. I hardly imagined you would have the
nerve to kidnap Zaroff himself.  
BEN: What's so funny?  
JAMIE: Aye, what?  
POLLY: I don't see what you've got to laugh at.  
ZAROFF: Dear lady, if you wish to stop my plans, you are all too late.  
RAMO: Too late?  
ZAROFF: The process has started. My nuclear reactor is activated, and when the
desired figure is reached, fission will take place, and none of all this will
matter for any of us.  
DOCTOR: He's only bluffing. Nothing can start without him.  
ZAROFF: Ah, Doctor, how do you know that?  
DOCTOR: Simple. The great Zaroff would have to be there to set off the
explosion. Miss your big moment? I think not.  
ZAROFF: You cannot hold me. My guards will  
RAMO: Will never find you. Not inside the temple you have defiled, Zaroff.  
ZAROFF: You are fools! Idiots! I am mightier than all of you. If I, if  
(Zaroff collapses.)  
POLLY: Doctor?  
JAMIE: It's a ruse.  
POLLY: What's the matter with him?  
DOCTOR: Some sort of attack.  
BEN: That stopped him. The project won't be able to go ahead now, will it?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. We'd better make sure.  
JAMIE: What would you do?  
DOCTOR: Get inside that laboratory.  
JAMIE: Then I'm coming with you.  
BEN: Yeah, me too.  
DOCTOR: No, somebody's got to stay here to look after Zaroff.  
POLLY: I, I'll stay.  
JAMIE: You can't bide here by yourself.  
RAMO: I'll stay with her.  
DOCTOR: Very well. Come on. Quick.  
POLLY: Take care.  
BEN: Yeah.

**[Temple of Amdo]**

BEN: Not another service?  
DOCTOR: This is likely to take some time.  
JAMIE: Could we not just slip out?  
DOCTOR: I don't think so. Better duck down here.  
(They hide behind the altar.)

**[Secret chamber]**

POLLY: It doesn't seem possible, does it?  
RAMO: What?  
POLLY: Well, look at him. He doesn't look very menacing now, does he?  
RAMO: There is still evil in this man. It hangs over him like a shroud. You
will pay dearly for your crimes, Zaroff.  
ZAROFF: I know, I know. But before I die, priest, you must help me to pray to
your god for atonement.  
RAMO: Why should I help you?  
ZAROFF: Have pity on me. At least help me stand at your side so I may feel the
aura of your goodness.  
POLLY: I think you should. He does look very ill.  
RAMO: It's more than you deserve, Zaroff. But for the blessing of Amdo I will
grant you this last request.  
(Ramo helps Zaroff up, and Zaroff starts strangling him. Ramo throws him off
and grabs a sword. He jabs at Zaroff but Zaroff grabs it and presses it
against Ramo's throat.)  
ZAROFF: And now, meddling priest, this is the end of you.  
(Zaroff throws Ramo down and makes to stab him in the back. Polly tries to
intervene.)  
POLLY: Don't! Stop it!  
(Zaroff throws her off and kills Ramo. Polly screams.)  
ZAROFF: You will come with me.  
(He takes her into the tunnel.)

**[Temple of Amdo]**

(The Doctor, Ben and Jamie peer over the altar wearing fish masks. The
celebrants are leaving.)  
BEN: Who'd have thought it would take that long.  
JAMIE: Let's get started.  
BEN: Yeah, quick.  
DOCTOR: Just a minute, I've had a thought.  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: Jamie, you'd better watch Zaroff.  
JAMIE: Why?  
DOCTOR: Well, we need a guide, and only Ramo knows all the passages.  
JAMIE: Oh, if you say so, Doctor.  
(Ramo staggers out of the secret chamber.)  
JAMIE: Doctor, look!  
RAMO: Zaroff.  
DOCTOR: Come on. Come on.  
(They help Ramo down the steps and lay him down while Jamie goes to check on
Polly.)  
BEN: Is he?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
BEN: Zaroff was having us on.  
JAMIE: Polly's gone.  
DOCTOR: Zaroff's taken her as a hostage.  
BEN: Well, let's go!  
DOCTOR: No, Ben. Jamie, you go after Polly. Only watch out. Zaroff's a
desperate man.  
JAMIE: Right.  
DOCTOR: Ben, you and I have other fish to fry. Come on.

**[Tunnel]**

(Zaroff is dragging Polly along by a rope tied around her wrists.)  
POLLY: Oh, wait. I can't go on any more.  
ZAROFF: You will go on if I have to drag you. Wait. Did you hear anything?  
POLLY: No, nothing.  
ZAROFF: Come on.  
POLLY: No.  
ZAROFF: Do you want the same treatment as the priest?  
POLLY: No.  
ZAROFF: Come.  
JAMIE: Polly?  
(Polly pulls the rope out of Zaroff's hands and runs to Jamie.)  
ZAROFF: Wait. Come back here. Come back, I warn you.  
(Round a corner Jamie starts to untie Polly.)  
ZAROFF: Ah!  
(The nimble Jamie avoids Zaroff's attacks. Polly hits him on the head with a
rock and he turns so Jamie can jump on his back.)  
POLLY: Jamie!  
(Zaroff throws Jamie off. Sean and Jacko arrive. Sean yells.)  
ZAROFF: Go back. Go back.  
(Zaroff grabs Polly then throws her into Jamie's arms as he runs off,
laughing.)  
JAMIE: He's away.  
POLLY: Jamie, quickly, we've got to go and warn the Doctor.  
JAMIE: Aye, the Doctor's going to find a heap of trouble if Zaroff gets back
there first.  
JACKO: How do we find the laboratory?  
POLLY: Ara, she's the only one we know who knows the way. Now you go back to
the temple and we'll go and find her.

**[Council chamber]**

DAMON: The slaves are in revolt. They've cut off all food supplies.  
THOUS: I cannot understand it. Why do they act like this when the hour of
triumph is at hand?  
DAMON: They're just slaves, what can you expect?  
THOUS: Where is Zaroff? He should be here to attend to this.  
DAMON: Disappeared.  
THOUS: Disappeared? He can't have. Go and look for him.  
DAMON: There is no time, Excellency. You must take control now.  
THOUS: So be it. I cannot let my people starve. Bring them before me that I
may hear their demands.  
DAMON: Yes, great Thous, I will tell them.  
(Damon leaves.)  
THOUS: All-wise, all-seeing Amdo, help me now.  
(Zaroff enters with two of his guards.)  
THOUS: Zaroff! Where have you been? We've been looking for you. The workers
are in revolt.  
ZAROFF: My guards will restore order.  
THOUS: They are simple people. I'm sure they will  
ZAROFF: Those who resist will be killed.  
THOUS: Killed?  
ZAROFF: I have no time to waste.  
THOUS: Zaroff, you are subject to me in all matters. I will not have my people  
ZAROFF: Your people? Your people? They are my people now. I hold their whole
world in my power.  
THOUS: The Doctor was right about you. I order your project stopped at this
moment. Guards! Take Zaroff to the temple and hold him there.  
(Zaroff signals his own guards to stop the Atlanteans.)  
ZAROFF: You're a fool. You're a fool! I'll send you to your beloved goddess
Amdo to discuss the future of the universe with her.  
THOUS: I demand that you  
ZAROFF: You? You demand? You demand? Well since your, since your beloved
goddess has developed such an enchanting appetite for people, it is only
fitting that the great Thous should offer himself. No, no, I shall offer him.  
(Zaroff takes a pistol from under his cloak and shoots Thous.)  
ZAROFF: Kill those two men. Nothing in the world can stop me now!

__**Episode Four**__

**[Council chamber]**

(A little later, Ben and the Doctor enter.)  
BEN: Doctor, look at this! Someone's been having a right punch-up in here.  
DOCTOR: It's the governor. It's Thous.  
BEN: Is he all right?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. Doesn't seem to have hit anything vital.  
BEN: Doesn't look too good, though.  
DOCTOR: Neither would you with a bullet in you.  
BEN: If we don't stop Zaroff soon, we'll all be for the chop.  
DOCTOR: I know. Come on, we must get him to safety.  
BEN: Well, then what?  
DOCTOR: To the generating station.

**[Secret chamber]**

JACKO: Are you sure the Doctor said we are to meet here?  
ARA: He must come back soon.  
SEAN: Well, if he's not back in five minutes we move on, okay?  
JACKO: Oh, where to, if the whole world is going to blow up in a couple of
hours?  
SEAN: You're a great comfort to have around, did anyone ever tell you that?  
ARA: Look out.  
DOCTOR: Here we are. Careful. Anyone at home?  
ARA: Oh, Doctor! Oh, what's wrong?  
BEN: He's wounded, but don't worry, Ara, he'll be all right.  
DOCTOR: Where's Polly and Jamie?  
ARA: They've gone to Zaroff's laboratory.  
DOCTOR: Why?  
ARA: To look for you. I showed them which way to go and then they told me to
come back here and wait.  
DOCTOR: We'll have to find them. Now, listen everyone. I have a plan.  
SEAN: Good.  
DOCTOR: It might even work.  
SEAN: Well?  
DOCTOR: Our one hope of stopping Zaroff is to flood all this lower part of
Atlantis.  
BEN: But that means in here.  
DOCTOR: Yes. The temple, and Zaroff's laboratory.  
SEAN: Yes, but will the water stop there?  
DOCTOR: Don't know. We'll have to take that chance.  
JACKO: Yeah, but the people here.  
DOCTOR: They'll have to be warned and moved to a higher level. That's your job
and Sean's.  
SEAN: And you?  
DOCTOR: Ben and I will try and get into the generating station. We'll turn up
the power on the reactor, break down the sea walls and flood the laboratory.
There's only one thing that's worrying me.  
SEAN: What's that?  
DOCTOR: Can we all swim?

**[Zaroff's laboratory]**

MAN [OC]: Stabiliser station Z2 calling. Stabiliser station Z2 calling.
Routine check.  
TECH: Control receiving.  
MAN [OC]: Stabilisers normal. Nothing to report.  
TECH: Thank you, station Z-2, report again at zero minus five.  
MAN [OC]: Will do.  
TECH: That's in another ten minutes.  
MAN 2 [OC]: Priority, priority. Reactor station Z3 calling. Reactor station Z3
calling.  
ZAROFF: Zaroff here.  
MAN 2 [OC]: Reading maximum. Gauges four, five and six steady. Gauge three
fluctuating and unpredictable.  
ZAROFF: Bring in the reserve.  
MAN 2 [OC]: The reserve? But if that fails.  
ZAROFF: That is an order! Report back if the fault continues.  
MAN2 [OC]: Yes, Professor.  
ZAROFF: Nothing can go wrong now. Nothing must go wrong.  
MAN 3 [OC]: Emergency, power network control.  
ZAROFF: Zaroff here, what's the problem?  
MAN 3 [OC]: Station eleven is no longer operating, the workers have deserted.  
ZAROFF: Deserted? What's the matter with them? Where are they?  
MAN 3 [OC]: They're out looking for food.  
ZAROFF: Why?  
MAN 3 [OC]: The food supplies have not arrived and there's a rumour that we're
facing starvation. They've all panicked.  
ZAROFF: And no reserves?  
MAN 3 [OC]: That's right.  
ZAROFF: Get them back at once. Send the guards after them.  
MAN 3 [OC]: I've had to bring the guards into the plant to prevent a complete
breakdown.  
ZAROFF: Well, do the best you can. I get more men to you within the hour.
Blast! Blast! Blast!

**[Outside the generating station]**

(There's an armed guard on duty. The Doctor and Ben stay out of sight.)  
BEN: A guard! How are we going to get past him?  
DOCTOR: We'll walk past him.  
BEN: What, in those trousers?  
DOCTOR: Oh, you think I look a bit conspicuous, do you?  
BEN: A bit, yeah.  
DOCTOR: Maybe you're right. I know. You're a guard, and I'm a prisoner, right?  
BEN: Right!  
DOCTOR: Now don't make a mess of it, there's a good chap.  
GUARD: Halt!  
BEN: Prisoner and escort for Professor Zaroff.  
GUARD: Password?  
BEN: Ay?  
GUARD: Password?  
BEN: Yeah, well, look it's all right for you giving me the old chat, mate, but
I know nothing about passwords. I've been out chasing this burke all day.  
GUARD: Professor Zaroff's not here anyway.  
BEN: Well, I know that. My orders was to bring him here and wait.  
GUARD: That's all very well. How do I know he's a wanted man?  
BEN: Well, blimey, look at him. He ain't normal, is he?  
GUARD: Yes, I see what you mean. All right.  
(The guard lets them through.)  
DOCTOR: You don't know the password either!  
GUARD: It's Oscar. Get him out of here!  
BEN: Go on, get out! Thanks, mate.  
DOCTOR: Very well done, Ben, very well done. I'm not quite sure about that not
being normal bit, but very well done. I couldn't have done better myself.  
BEN: Thanks.  
GUARD 2: Halt. Give the password.  
BEN: Oscar.  
GUARD: Pass, Oscar.  
DOCTOR: Come on, now. We've got little time.

**[Power station]**

(Ben sneaks up behind the lone engineer and knocks him out.)  
BEN: What now?  
DOCTOR: Cut those cables.  
(Ben gets to work. There is a huge flywheel in the middle of the room driving
the main generator. It begins to falter and slow. The Doctor adjusts some
control levers.)  
BEN: Do you know what you're doing?  
DOCTOR: Oh, what a question. Of course I don't! There's no rule against
trying, is there? There. Now, Zaroff's laboratory. He should be feeling the
effects of this little lot any time now.

**[Tunnel]**

JAMIE: There's a gap through here.  
POLLY: Oh, Jamie, I think we're lost. Are you sure this is the way Ara told us
to come?  
JAMIE: Aye. All the tunnels look alike, though.  
POLLY: No, listen. We must be somewhere below Zaroff's power source.  
JAMIE: Aye, it's like the beating of the Devil's heart.  
POLLY: You're not far wrong. We'd better keep going. The laboratory can't be
far away.  
JAMIE: Aye, but which way?

**[Zaroff's laboratory]**

ZAROFF: That reading must be wrong, you idiot. I'll check it myself. No,
that's not possible. Come here. Look at that reading. That's all we need now,
radiation leak. Where the Devil is it coming from?

**[Tunnel ledge]**

JAMIE: I told you, don't look down.  
POLLY: But Jamie, look. The wall down there. It's glowing.  
JAMIE: What is it?  
POLLY: It could be radiation.  
JAMIE: Well, what's that then?  
POLLY: Radiation? Well, it's. Oh, it's too difficult to explain. The walls are
beginning to crumble. It's all that vibration.  
JAMIE: Let's see, the sea's on the other side of that wall. Now if that gives
way.  
POLLY: Yes.  
JAMIE: There must be way up to higher ground.  
(The wall starts to crack and sea water begins to come in. Jamie and Polly get
to the end of the ledge and run up the next tunnel.)  
POLLY: Must get breath.  
JAMIE: Lucky it's uphill. Take more time for the water to reach us.  
POLLY: What's that?  
JAMIE: It's given way. The sea's breaking through!

**[Another tunnel]**

(Sean and Jacko are carrying Thous on a stretcher, with Ara following.)  
SEAN: Will you listen to that.  
JACKO: What is it?  
SEAN: How would I know, but it certainly isn't closing time at Betty Murphy's
pub. It can be only one thing. It's the Doctor, of course. He's started to
flood Atlantis. The sea's breaking in.  
THOUS: To raise Atlantis from the sea was only the dream of a madman after
all.  
ARA: Rest. Don't speak.  
JACKO: Aye, rest.  
SEAN: And you best forget about all that now and look to the future. That is,
if we're going to have any future.  
(The lower levels of the city are flooding. The torrent breaks the idol in the
temple.)  
SEAN: Well, personally speaking, not being a terribly good swimmer myself, I
think I'll just start to make a move.  
JACKO: Ah, we've got a visitor.  
SEAN: Oh Damon, you got my warning then.  
DAMON: My operating room. A life's work, washed away.  
THOUS: Damon.  
DAMON: Thous.  
THOUS: We can start again, Damon.  
SEAN: Look, if we don't hurry and get onto high ground above water level,
we're going to be turned into fish food.  
DAMON: Yes, you're right. Quite so. I'll help. We've got a long way to go yet.  
SEAN: Come on, Jacko, up. Gently now. That's it.

**[Tunnel]**.

POLLY: Oh, no! It's a dead end.  
JAMIE: Aye.  
POLLY: Jamie, we must go back. We've got to warn the others. There must be
another turning.  
JAMIE: No, I kept an eye open for one on the way up. Besides, would you listen
to that water.  
POLLY: We've got to get out of here somehow.  
(Jamie raises his candle to look, and the flame gutters.)  
JAMIE: Do you see that? There's a draught. Right, that's what we'll follow.
I'll go first, and you stay close behind me.

**[Mountain cave]**

(Damon sets up a first aid station, high above the city. Refugees are huddling
here.)  
DAMON: Artificial respiration. Your wound?  
THOUS: A little better. How is my poor country?  
DAMON: The water has already flooded the lower parts of the city.  
THOUS: The great enemy, which we held at bay for so many centuries, the ever-
lasting nightmare is here at last.  
DAMON: Rescue parties are being organised. All passages have been blocked
except the main shaft. We're keeping that open till the last to give the
stragglers a chance.  
THOUS: What of Lolem the priest?  
DAMON: Well, last seen he was going towards the temple to seek aid from Amdo.  
THOUS: He is lost then.  
SEAN: We may still find them. Are you all right there?  
DAMON: You look after yourself.  
SEAN: Oh, hey Jacko? Any luck?  
JACKO: What do you expect? They must have all been drowned.  
SEAN: Ah, well. Probably a better death than the one that's in store for us
when Zaroff lets off his explosion.

**[Zaroff's laboratory]**

ZAROFF: No one, I repeat, no one will leave his place. Everything goes
according to schedule, except that the time of the big detonation has been
advanced. The whole project will be activated from this control point. That is
all until zero minus five.  
(The Doctor and Ben enter.)  
ZAROFF: Now we must connect you.  
DOCTOR: Good day to you. I hope I'm not too late.  
ZAROFF: There is the man who has been trying to sabotage all our plans. Make
sure he doesn't leave us now.  
DOCTOR: Oh, how very nice of you, but I'm afraid I've interrupted something
important, haven't I? Oh, yes, I can see that I have. You were on the point of
exploding your firecracker, weren't you?  
(Zaroff laughs.)  
DOCTOR: I hope you've let these gentlemen into your big secret.  
ZAROFF: They share everything with me.  
DOCTOR: Naturally. They can't help themselves, can they? They must be devoted
to you, to allow you to blow them all to pieces!  
TECH: You what? What's he talking about, Professor?  
DOCTOR: Oh, have I dropped a brick? Oh, I seem to have shaken some of them.
Zaroff, I think you ought to know the sea has broken through and is about to
overwhelm us here.  
ZAROFF: Don't listen to him. The man lies.  
DOCTOR: Then perhaps the distant roaring that we can hear is just the goddess
Amdo with the indigestion?  
TECH: He's right. Come on!  
ZAROFF: Don't be alarmed. Don't be fooled. Ah, they're cowards, traitors. But
it doesn't matter.  
DOCTOR: Time is running out, Zaroff. Hadn't you better call it a day?  
ZAROFF: You cannot beat me, Doctor.  
(Zaroff turns a control and a portcullis descends cutting him and his control
panel off from the rest of the room.)  
ZAROFF: You see, I have anticipated every situation. There was always a
possibility that someone would try to keep me from my ultimate moment of
triumph. Now no one can get through this, and all the controls are on this
side. Now all I must do is press the plunger when the needle of that dial is
over the thousand mark. Simple, no? I tell you, so that you may share the
last, great experiment of Zaroff!  
BEN: He's off his rocker.  
DOCTOR: I know. I've got to get him out of there. Come over here. I've got an
idea.  
ZAROFF: Don't go away, Doctor. You will die just the same. You might as well
stay and watch me.

**[Tunnel]**.

(Jamie has climbed up the rock face to find the source of the breeze.)  
JAMIE: Hold the candle. Oh, would you be careful?  
POLLY: Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose.  
JAMIE: Right.  
POLLY: Any luck?  
JAMIE: Aye, there's a wee hole down there. I can't see where it leads to
though. But if you're willing to take a chance?  
POLLY: Do we have a choice?  
(He pulls her up and they crawl on.)  
POLLY: Only just in time.  
JAMIE: Aye, we're not out of the woods yet.

**[Zaroff's laboratory]**

BEN: Doctor, I've got to go. The water's nearly here.  
ZAROFF: I see you have your deserters, too, Doctor. That leaves just you and
me.  
DOCTOR: All right, Ben.  
BEN: Goodbye.  
ZAROFF: Young fool. I will press the plunger long before the water gets here.
The result will be the same.  
DOCTOR: I know. But it's much more exciting in the dark.  
(The Doctor pulls out the lighting cables.)  
ZAROFF: Doctor, you are a comedian.  
(Zaroff draws his pistol and raises the portcullis. The lights come back on
again.)  
ZAROFF: You see. Keep very still, Doctor. We have an emergency system here.
You have solved nothing. Now unfortunately I have to tie you up. Turn around.  
(Ben has returned, and he lowers the portcullis, rolling underneath it as it
falls. Zaroff is cut off from the control panel.)  
ZAROFF: No! No! You cannot do this to me!  
(Zaroff fires his pistol wildly as the Doctor and Ben get away.)  
ZAROFF: No! No! No!  
(Zaroff tries to reach through the portcullis to the controls, but the plunger
is just out of reach.)

**[Tunnel]**

BEN: Doctor, hurry. Now what's the matter?  
DOCTOR: Ben, I've been thinking. I can't leave Zaroff to drown down there. I'm
going back for him.  
BEN: But why on Earth? We've got to get out of here quick or we'll be cut off!  
DOCTOR: But we can't leave him there.  
BEN: Look, you're coming with me.

**[Tunnel cave]**

POLLY: Oh, it's no use, Jamie, I'll never make it.  
JAMIE: Course you can. One wee slope and we're away.  
POLLY: And another and another and another. It's no use, I won't, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Come on.  
POLLY: No, no, I can't, Jamie, I can't. I can't. I can't.  
JAMIE: Polly! Polly! Come on. I'll help you.

**[Tunnel]**

(The water is still coming in.)  
DOCTOR: Zaroff. He's cut off.  
BEN: Zaroff? Who cares about him? That means the others must be, too. Well,
are they?  
DOCTOR: Well, how do I know? All we can do is to go on going up. Come on.  
(In his lab, Zaroff is waist deep in water and still trying to reach the
plunger. On a steep incline, Ben slips.)  
DOCTOR: Nearly there. Of course, if you will lie down and sleep.  
BEN: Who said anything about lying down?

**[Cave]**

(Just above the shoreline.)  
JAMIE: Come on. Come on. Fresh air.  
POLLY: Oh, we made it. Ben and the Doctor?  
JAMIE: I'm thinking he wouldn't have stood much of a chance back there. They
may have.  
(Jamie leaves Polly to cry and goes off towards the beach. After a few moments
she takes off her headdress and follows. In the lab, the rising water cuts out
the power, but Zaroff keeps straining for the plunger even as it closes over
his head.)

**[Mountain cave]**

DAMON: Any sign of the Doctor?  
ARA: No. He must have died saving us.  
THOUS: We'll raise a stone to him in the temple.  
DAMON: No. No more temples. It was temples and priests and superstition that
made us follow Zaroff in the first place. When the water's found it's own
level, the temple will be buried forever. We shall never return to it. But we
will have enough left to build a new Atlantis, without gods and without fish
people.  
THOUS: Yes. That shall be his memorial.

**[Tunnel]**

(Finally, daylight ahead.)  
BEN: Doctor, what about Polly?

**[Mountainside]**

(Jamie and Polly are sitting by a rock.)  
POLLY: I can't see anyone.  
(There is a noise behind them.)  
JAMIE: Whist.  
(Jamie draws his dirk and circles around.)  
DOCTOR: Boo!  
JAMIE: You!  
DOCTOR: Me?  
JAMIE: We thought you were dead.  
DOCTOR: Us? Polly, good to see you. Come on, you two.  
(They head down to the Tardis. Sean and Jacko arrive to see them go inside
it.)  
SEAN: Oh, no. I can't believe it.  
JACKO: What?  
SEAN: A flaming English police box.  
(The Tardis dematerialises.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Right. Off we go into the wide blue yonder, as someone was once heard
to remark.  
POLLY: Hooray.  
BEN: Yeah, I'm not sorry to be out of that place. Phwoar, Jamie, you don't
half stink of fish!  
JAMIE: Oh, you want to take a wee sniff of yourself, Benjamin. He's not
exactly a bonnie bunch of heather.  
DOCTOR: You sound very happy, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Oh aye, Doctor, I am now. You know I never thought I'd say this, but,
well it's great.  
POLLY: What is?  
JAMIE: All this. I'll never know what makes it go, mind you, but, well, at
least I feel safe in here. It's only the wee things outside that are, well,
alarming.  
DOCTOR: He's got a point there.  
BEN: Yeah, you can say that again.  
JAMIE: Is it a fact, though, Doctor? You can't exactly control the Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Control it? Of course I can control it.  
JAMIE: No, no, what I meant was, can you not exactly make it go where you mean
it to?  
DOCTOR: If I wanted to. It's just that I've never wanted to.  
(General sounds of disbelief.)  
BEN: Oh, yeah, I bet.  
DOCTOR: Right, just for that, I'll show you. Now, where shall we go? I know,
let's go to Mars.  
(The Tardis suddenly lurches.)  
POLLY: Doctor, what's happening?  
BEN: Doctor, can't you do something?  
DOCTOR: Do something? I seem to have done something. It's all your fault,
wanting me to tamper with the steering. I'm very sorry, everybody, but I'm
afraid the Tardis is out of control!  
(Polly screams.)
