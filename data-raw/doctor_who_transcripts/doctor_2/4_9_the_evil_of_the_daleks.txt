__**Episode One**__

**[Gatwick Airport]**

(July 20th 1966. A truck comes out of the hangar and drives away with the
Tardis secured to the flatbed at the back. The Doctor and Jamie try to give
chase but soon lose sight of it.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie!  
JAMIE: The Tardis!

**[Garage]**

(Next to the hangar is a garage with fuel pumps outside. A man is working at a
bench covered in machine parts. A radio is playing music very loudly.)  
JAMIE: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Excuse me!  
(The man adjusts his hearing aid.)  
HALL: Ay?  
DOCTOR: I wonder if you can help us?  
HALL: My mate likes the wireless turned on at full blast. I have to keep this
turned down.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I see.  
(Hall turns the wireless off.)  
JAMIE: Who's taken the Tardis?  
HALL: The what?  
DOCTOR: He means the police telephone box.  
HALL: He said Tardis or something.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, Tardis, that's another name for it.  
HALL: Oh, foreign, is he?  
JAMIE: Me, foreign? You're the one that's foreign. I'm Scottish.  
DOCTOR: That's right. Tardis is a is a Gaelic word. Jamie, hush.  
JAMIE: It's getting further away all the time.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. Well, anyway, it's our property and we've come to collect
it.  
HALL: Oh, you mean the

**[Field outside the airport]**

(A man is listening to this in a field next to the airport, through a radio
transmitter.)  
HALL [OC]: The police box?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes!  
HALL [OC]: Yeah. Well, that's gone.

**[Garage]**

JAMIE: Oh, we know it's gone. That's the whole point. Its ours and somebody's
stolen it.  
HALL: Oh, I don't know about that. I've got a note here somewhere. Yeah, here
we are. There. Police Tel Box. Collection 3 o'clock.  
DOCTOR: Let me see this, please.  
HALL: Been signed for.  
DOCTOR: Yes, so I see. J Smith. Doesn't really help us, does it?  
HALL: Yeah, well, I just do what I'm told. You'd better see the airport
Commandant or someone.  
DOCTOR: Oh, no. I don't think we'd better do that. Jamie, I think we'd better
talk to the police.  
HALL: Of course I, er, I do know the name of the firm what picked it up.  
JAMIE: You do?  
HALL: Yeah, firm name of, er, Leatherman.  
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. You'll be hearing from us.  
JAMIE: Leatherman. Now that's a clue. Just a minute. Now, what street do they?
Doctor, wait.  
(The Doctor drags Jamie outside. Once they are out of sight, Hall talks into
his hearing aid.)  
HALL: Did you get all that?  
KENNEDY [OC]: Every word. We'd better get going. Get your money back at the
warehouse.

**[Outside the garage]**

(Kennedy watches Jamie and the Doctor through binoculars.)  
JAMIE: We should have followed that clue he gave us.  
DOCTOR: Perhaps. I think we'd better keep an eye on him.  
JAMIE: Why?  
DOCTOR: Well, didn't you notice his overalls? They were much too small for
him, and the top sheet of his clip board was different to all the others. And
when we mentioned the police he became friendly  
JAMIE: Aye. Hey, may  
(The Doctor pulls Jamie out of sight behind some oil drums as Hall walks past.
A few moments later, they follow him.)

**[Field outside the airport]**

KENNEDY: Kennedy to base. Kennedy to base. Do you read me?

**[Antique shop study]**

(A man in Victorian clothes answers the radio.)  
KENNEDY [OC]: Kennedy to base. Do you read?  
WATERFIELD: Yes.  
KENNEDY [OC]: The Doctor and his friend are following Bob Hall.  
WATERFIELD: I knew they would suspect him.  
KENNEDY [OC]: (I'll go on to the warehouse.  
WATERFIELD: Very good, Mister Kennedy.

**[Airport gates]**

(Jamie and the Doctor watch Hall drive off in his car.)  
DOCTOR: That's him. There he goes.  
JAMIE: Oh, no.  
(The Doctor spots a black cab.)  
DOCTOR: For hire.  
JAMIE: Ay?  
DOCTOR: Follow that car.

**[Antique shop study]**

(There is a knock at the door.)  
WATERFIELD: Yes?  
PERRY OC]: Perry, sir.  
WATERFIELD: Oh, er, one moment, Mister Perry.  
(Waterfield unbolts the door and lets in a slight man in his early twenties.)  
PERRY: It's here.  
WATERFIELD: Good.  
PERRY: Like me to open the shutters, sir? Lovely day outside.  
WATERFIELD: I have a choice between the sun or noise, Mister Perry. I regret
shutting out one, but at least I keep out the other.  
PERRY: Yes. (a clock chimes) I say, that's very good. Just come in, eh? Mint
condition. Eighteen seventy, is it?  
WATERFIELD: Approximately.  
PERRY: Don't know who your contacts are, sir, but this is marvellous.  
WATERFIELD: Well, Victorian timepieces are my specialty, Mister Perry.  
PERRY: Wish you'd tell me who makes them for you, sir.  
WATERFIELD: But then you would be as wise as I, and that wouldn't do at all,
would it?  
PERRY: Whoever makes them, Mister Waterfield, they'd fool an expert. If I
didn't know it was impossible, I'd say it was absolutely genuine.  
WATERFIELD: And, er, there was no trouble with the box?  
PERRY: Apparently not. A bit out of our line, isn't it, sir? A battered old
police box?  
WATERFIELD: The whims and caprices of our patrons is our line, Mister Perry.  
PERRY: Hmm. Odd though.  
WATERFIELD: Mister Perry, I pay you the sum of 50 guineas per week, do I not?  
PERRY: Pounds, actually, sir. 50 pounds.  
WATERFIELD: Yes. I hope I may be forgiven if I believe that entitles me to
demanding less curiosity of you.  
PERRY: Sorry, sir.  
WATERFIELD: It is, I think you will agree, a princely salary.  
PERRY: No complaints on that score. As long as I'm not asked to do anything
dicey.  
WATERFIELD: Dicey?  
PERRY: Crooked. Illegal.  
WATERFIELD: Your candour is refreshing, Mister Perry, even if your judgement
of character is somewhat questionable.  
PERRY: I didn't mean that  
WATERFIELD: I know perfectly well what you meant. You may rest assured, I
shall not ask you to do anything dicey.  
PERRY: No, sir.  
WATERFIELD: I think you are wanted in the shop, Mister Perry.  
PERRY: And the telephone box, sir. What do we do with it?  
WATERFIELD: Do? We do nothing.  
PERRY: Oh, right.  
(Perry leaves.)  
WATERFIELD: Nothing except wait.

**[Lane]**

(Hall's car is parked in a narrow lane alongside some railway arches with lock
up garages.)  
DOCTOR: This is his car. He must be around here somewhere.  
(There is an old abandoned warehouse at the end of the lane.)

**[Warehouse]**

KENNEDY: You sure you weren't followed?  
HALL: No, course I wasn't. Hey, you haven't told me what this little caper's
about yet, Kennedy.  
KENNEDY: Counted the money yet then, have you?  
HALL: No, not yet.  
KENNEDY: Or do you think I made a mistake giving you two fifty instead of
seventy five? We thought you might like a little extra.  
HALL: What for?  
KENNEDY: You know those two at the hangar?  
HALL: Yeah?  
KENNEDY: They're outside. You weren't followed. We'll be ready for them, won't
we? That's what the extra's for.  
HALL: Now listen.  
KENNEDY: You on one side of the door, me on the other. Right? Straight over
their heads. They won't even know what hit them.  
HALL: Nah, not me, mate.  
KENNEDY: It's a bit late to argue, isn't it? They're outside.  
HALL: Now listen, I'm not getting mixed up in no kidnapping, and that's flat.  
(Hall turns for the door and Kennedy attacks him.)

**[Outside the Warehouse]**

(Jamie hears noises inside.)  
JAMIE: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Well, have you tried the door?  
(The Doctor opens the door.)

**[Warehouse]**

(Hall is lying on the floor.)  
DOCTOR: It's the man in the overalls. It's all right, he's alive.  
(Kennedy leaves unnoticed.)  
HALL: Where's Ken  
DOCTOR: Ken? Ken who?  
JAMIE: Make him tell us where the Tardis is!  
DOCTOR: No good, he's out cold. See if we can find some water somewhere.
Hello, this is something. This really is something.  
(The Doctor has found the money.)  
DOCTOR: But why pay him to help steal the Tardis and then knock him on the
head?  
JAMIE: Why steal the Tardis anyway?  
DOCTOR: That's what's been bothering me, Jamie, too.  
JAMIE: There's no water here. Hey, that looks a lot of money, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: It's between two and three hundred pounds. Yes, it is a lot, at least
for what he had to do. Put on a pair of overalls and just hang around. Come to
think of it, why hang around? He was obviously planted. Why not just go off in
the lorry?  
JAMIE: You've found something else?  
DOCTOR: I don't know.  
(There are cigarettes and a matchbook on the windowsill. The Doctor searches
Hall's pockets.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, this man rolled his own cigarettes, so these must belong to
somebody else. That's a fair assumption.  
(A train rumbles past over the arches.)  
JAMIE: What's that?  
DOCTOR: It's all right. It's only a train.  
JAMIE: A what?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's a train. There are carriages and they go on wheels, on
rails, and they're drawn by a steam. Hey, come back!  
(Hall rushes out of the door and fastens it with a metal bar through the
handles.)  
JAMIE: Well, give us a hand.  
(When Jamie stops pushing the door, the bar falls out and the door opens.)  
JAMIE: Not a sign of him. The only chance we had.  
DOCTOR: There is this. (the matchbook) The Tricolour. It's a coffee bar,
apparently. And that's not all.  
JAMIE: Well, what else?  
DOCTOR: Well, normally people pull out their matches from right to left. These
have been torn out from left to right.  
JAMIE: What does that mean?  
DOCTOR: It means we've got to find a coffee bar called The Tricolour, and look
for a man called Ken or Kenneth someone, who's left-handed.  
JAMIE: Now we've got something to go on.  
DOCTOR: But it's so little, Jamie. It's too little. He might only have been
there once. There's no guarantee he'll ever go there again.  
JAMIE: Now, don't give up Doctor. Remember Bruce.  
DOCTOR: Bruce?  
JAMIE: Robert Bruce.

**[Antique shop study]**

KENNEDY: Look, I told you  
WATERFIELD: And they were not aware that you were watching?  
KENNEDY: No, they were too busy trying to work it all out.  
WATERFIELD: Good.  
KENNEDY: That Bob Hall was a bit of a problem. I didn't think he'd turn nasty.  
WATERFIELD: You didn't hurt him?  
KENNEDY: Him? You're joking.  
WATERFIELD: I can assure you that I am not.  
KENNEDY: He's a lot bigger than me, you know. No, I just battered him one and
that was it.  
WATERFIELD: That was what, Kennedy? I must know precisely what has happened.
How badly injured was Hall?  
KENNEDY: Well, a bit dazed, that's all. He just mumbled something then made a
run for it when they weren't looking.  
WATERFIELD: And where is he now?  
KENNEDY: Well, I went round to his place later. There he was coming out the
front door, zip bag and everything. He got in a cab and went to Euston.  
WATERFIELD: Were you able to find another hansom and follow him?  
KENNEDY: Ay?  
WATERFIELD: Did you follow him?  
KENNEDY: Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about him. He's gone up north.  
WATERFIELD: That disposes of that. Now, this is extremely important. You did
leave the matches?  
KENNEDY: Don't worry about it. The Doctor found the cigarettes and the
matches.  
WATERFIELD: And you are certain they were the ones bearing the name of the
coffee shop?  
KENNEDY: Coffee bar.  
WATERFIELD: Yes.  
KENNEDY: Yes. I told you, it worked like a charm. I never thought it would,
but you were quite right. He got onto the name on the matches straight away.  
WATERFIELD: Well, just one last thing, to make quite sure.  
(Waterfield takes two photographs from a deed box.)  
WATERFIELD: Now, you are certain that these are the people that you saw?  
KENNEDY: That's them, yeah. Yeah, definite.  
WATERFIELD: Right. Well, I shall want you to keep out of sight. You'd better
stay in the house. And on no account are you to talk to Mister Perry about any
of this.  
KENNEDY: Okay.  
WATERFIELD: Okay? What does that mean?  
KENNEDY: What? Yes!  
WATERFIELD: Oh, I know my attitude may appear strange to you on occasions,
Kennedy.  
KENNEDY: You want to play the part of the Victorian grandfather, that's all
right by me. Must be a pretty good gimmick. You pay me well enough.  
WATERFIELD: It helps to sell to our customers.  
KENNEDY: Yeah, sure, sure. You've never told me what it is exactly you've got
against this Doctor and his friend. Some kind of vendetta or something?  
WATERFIELD: Explanations are not part of our arrangement.  
KENNEDY: Oh, just wondering.  
WATERFIELD: Imagination is a virtue, but it can become a vice.  
KENNEDY: Mind me own business. Yeah. I get the message.  
WATERFIELD: Ask Mister Perry to come and see me, will you please?  
(Kennedy leaves. Waterfield takes a key from the deed box and goes to the
bookcase. He removes a large volume and puts the key into a hidden lock.
Kennedy is watching from the hallway as the bookcase slides aside and
Waterfield goes into a secret room. He comes out soon after carrying a large
brown-paper parcel. He closes the secret door and puts it on the desk.)

**[Antique shop hallway]**

(Kennedy realises Perry is watching him.)  
KENNEDY: He wants to see us.  
PERRY: Oh, thank you. (He knocks four times on the door.)

**[Antique shop study]**

WATERFIELD: Who is it?  
PERRY [OC]: Perry, sir.  
WATERFIELD: One moment.  
PERRY: You wanted to see me, sir?  
WATERFIELD: Yes. I have an extremely important and delicate task for you to
perform.  
PERRY: Oh, yes? I say, you got a new delivery.  
WATERFIELD: Yes.  
PERRY: I didn't see it arrive.  
WATERFIELD: It was delivered last night. I've only just brought it in myself.
It is for a new customer.  
PERRY: Oh, yes?  
WATERFIELD: A Doctor Galloway. He's extremely wealthy and an ardent collector.  
PERRY: Of Victoriana, sir?  
WATERFIELD: No less. I do not know the Doctor personally, but we have arranged
to meet in the coffee shop, er, bar, nearby.  
PERRY: The Tricolour, sir?  
WATERFIELD: Yes. Unfortunately, I am unable to keep the appointment, so I want
you to go instead, Mister Perry. Here is a photograph of Doctor Galloway. This
is his assistant and secretary, Mister James McCrimmon. Now, I want you to ask
the Doctor to come to the shop tonight. Say at ten o' clock?  
PERRY: Ten o'clock, sir?  
WATERFIELD: Yes. Oh, don't worry, Mister Perry. I shall be attending to him
myself. You needn't wait.  
PERRY: Oh, right, sir.  
WATERFIELD: The Doctor is notoriously unpunctual. I fear you may have a long
and tedious wait.  
PERRY: I shall find him, sir. Do you want me to go now?  
WATERFIELD: If you please, Mister Perry.  
PERRY: Right.  
(Perry leaves, closing the door.)

**[Antique shop hallway]**

(Kennedy comes out of hiding and listens at the study door. Inside, Waterfield
bolts the door and goes inside the secret room again. This area is bright,
with a large packing case in one corner. A carved chair faces the far wall
where two metal arms extend into the room, about four feet off the floor and
eight feet apart. Waterfield adjusts some very un-Victorian equipment and sits
in the chair as the machinery hums.)  
PERRY: And what are you doing?  
KENNEDY: I can't make Mister Waterfield hear me. I knocked.  
PERRY: He's busy.  
KENNEDY: Okay, I'll try later.

**[Tricolour coffee bar]**

('Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen' by the Seekers is playing on the
jukebox.)  
JAMIE: Don't look so depressed, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: If only we knew what he looked like, Jamie.  
JAMIE: We'll ask one of the lasses in a moment, when things get quieter.  
DOCTOR: We've got to untangle this, you know.  
JAMIE: It's all quite obvious to me.  
DOCTOR: Oh?  
JAMIE: They're just robbers. Thieves, you understand.  
DOCTOR: No, no. There's more to it than that. Why leave that man in the hangar
to give us a clue?  
JAMIE: Which we haven't followed up, you know. Leatherman.  
DOCTOR: There is no delivery firm of that name. Not in the London area,
anyway. I checked in the phone book.  
JAMIE: But surely there's more places than London.  
DOCTOR: Maybe.  
JAMIE: Do you think this is some sort of a trap, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes. If only we knew who our enemies are.  
JAMIE: Not the Chameleons again!  
DOCTOR: No, something else. I can feel them, closing in all around us.

**[Antique shop secret room]**

WATERFIELD: I've done everything that you've asked of me. Isn't that enough?
Now you must tell me the truth. Do you hear? The truth!

**[Antique shop hallway]**

(Kennedy is listening at the study door.)  
WATERFIELD [OC]: But you must tell me. I demand! I'm talking to you! Come
back!  
(Waterfield comes out of the secret room, sweaty and tired, and locks it up.
Then he lies down on his couch. With nothing more heard, Kennedy leaves.)

**[Tricolour coffee bar]**

(The Doctor is building a tower of sugar cubes as Jamie returns from the
counter, evading the attentions of a young lady in a mini-kilt. The jukebox
has moved onto Hold Tight by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Titch.)  
JAMIE: Oh, if only the Laird could see that! Why do I get all the difficult
tasks, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Because you're so much better at them than I am, Jamie. Now, what did
you find out?  
JAMIE: None of the lasses here can remember anybody called Ken or Kenneth.  
DOCTOR: Oh, dear.  
JAMIE: Aye. But, they do have a different lot on duty in the evening. Now,
maybe they'll know.  
DOCTOR: Jamie, I'm being stared at. Is there something wrong with me?  
JAMIE: You mean up here, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Is my hair in disarray?  
JAMIE: Well, no more than usual.  
DOCTOR: Do I look strange or bizarre?  
JAMIE: Aye. Well maybe I'm just used to you.  
DOCTOR: That's some comfort. Look out, he's coming over.  
PERRY: I beg your pardon.  
DOCTOR: Not at all.  
PERRY: It is Doctor Galloway, isn't it?  
JAMIE: Dr. Galloway?  
PERRY: and Mister McCrimmon.  
JAMIE: Aye, I'm Jamie McCrimmon.  
PERRY: My card.  
DOCTOR: Yes, er, Mister Perry?  
PERRY: Mister Waterfield's frightfully sorry, but he can't meet you as
arranged.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, dear. What a pity.  
PERRY: But he said if you'd care to come to the shop at about ten tonight,
he'll see to you personally.  
DOCTOR: At about 10. Oh, yes. We'll be there.  
PERRY: Right-ho.  
DOCTOR: Right.  
PERRY: Right.  
(Perry leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Edward Waterfield. Genuine Victoriana.  
JAMIE: It can't be a mistake. Even though he got your name wrong, he knew
mine.  
DOCTOR: I wonder if Mister Kenneth has found us.  
JAMIE: Ay?  
DOCTOR: K. Perry, Esquire. Yes, I think we'll go and see Mister Edward
Waterfield.

**[Antique shop study]**

WATERFIELD: And he definitely said he would be here?  
PERRY: Yes, sir.  
WATERFIELD: Thank you. You have done excellently, Mister Perry. Good night.  
PERRY: See you in the morning, sir?  
WATERFIELD: Yes. Yes, in the morning.

**[Antique shop hallway]**

(Waterfield follows Perry out, locking the study behind him. He hears the
front door shut.)  
WATERFIELD: Kennedy. Kennedy?  
(Kennedy appears.)  
WATERFIELD: The Doctor is coming here tonight. I shall want you to help me.
And you had better put some warm clothes on. Dark things.  
KENNEDY: All right. You'd better make sure that police box is well covered-up,
in case the Doctor starts snooping about.  
WATERFIELD: Yes.  
(Waterfield leaves. Kennedy looks at his watch then the study door, then takes
a lock-pick from his back pocket and breaks into the study before going back
to the hall for his jacket and briefcase. In the study, he searches the desk
drawers. Kennedy tries to force the deed box but fails. Searching for a hidden
safe, he accidentally opens the door to the secret room.)

**[Antique shop secret room]**

(Kennedy enters. He examines the metal armatures whilst flicking switches. The
mechanism hums. Kennedy checks his watch again, and continues searching until
he finds the safe. As he tries to open it, a strange shape is forming behind
him. Finally he succeeds and starts emptying it, then stops as he catches
sight of an unearthly reflection in the metal. He turns to see a permanently
annoyed mobile giant pepper pot behind him.)  
DALEK: Who are you? Who are you? Answer!

__**Episode Two**__

_(From the Lost in Time DVD)_

**[Antique shop secret room]**

(Kennedy tries to run for it, but the Dalek fires, killing him. Then it backs
into the transmat device and disappears again.)

**[Antique shop]**

(The Doctor silences the door bell as they enter.)  
JAMIE: I don't know what you're being so cautious about.  
DOCTOR: Shh!  
JAMIE: They left the door open for us, didn't they?  
(A multitude of clocks chime.)  
JAMIE: Hey, it's half-past the nine o'clock.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know.  
JAMIE: But they made the appointment for ten. Why have we come early?  
DOCTOR: The early bird catches the worm, Jamie. Now do be quiet, there's a
good chap. And for heaven's sake, don't knock into anything.  
(The Doctor brushes past a statuette on a pedestal and Jamie catches it before
it falls.)  
DOCTOR: Shh!  
(Jamie looks at the statuette.)  
JAMIE: Any good, this?  
DOCTOR: It's interesting. In fact, Jamie, it's quite remarkable.  
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, you know you told me outside it said Genuine Victorian
Antiques? Well, all the stuff in here's brand new.  
DOCTOR: Hmm, you've noticed that.  
JAMIE: Of course I did. The man's a rogue.  
DOCTOR: Yes, so it seems. Except  
JAMIE: Except what?  
DOCTOR: Except that all these things are not reproductions. They're all
genuine.  
JAMIE: Now, that's ridiculous.  
DOCTOR: Here, look at this. To one deed box, four guineas. This is a bill from
William Dearing and Son, 1866.  
JAMIE: Then it's a forgery.  
DOCTOR: Yes. If you were going to make a forgery, wouldn't you try to dirty it
up a bit? Yellow the edges, crinkle it up? This is brand new.  
JAMIE: I've got an idea.  
DOCTOR: What?  
JAMIE: All the stuff in here is genuine.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
JAMIE: But brand new.  
DOCTOR: Well done.  
JAMIE: Well, that is impossible, unless Waterfield could have invented a time
machine like the Tardis, Doctor, and he's bringing all this stuff back from
Victorian times.  
DOCTOR: But it's not very likely, is it? The only way to find out is to ask
Waterfield.

**[Antique shop study]**

WATERFIELD: Kennedy!

**[Antique shop secret room]**

WATERFIELD: What happened?  
DALEK: The human discovered our communications system.  
WATERFIELD: And you murdered him?  
DALEK: He would have betrayed us.  
WATERFIELD: You don't have to kill!  
DALEK: Silence!  
WATERFIELD: I won't be silent! What are you dragging me into? You've destroyed
a human life. Don't you understand that?  
DALEK: That is of no consequence.  
WATERFIELD: No consequence?  
DALEK: There is only one form of life that matters. Dalek life. Obey your
orders, Waterfield.  
(The Dalek dematerializes.)  
WATERFIELD: No, wait, wait! What am I to do with the body? I can't, I can't go
on with this.

**[Antique shop]**

DOCTOR: I'm sure I heard somebody shouting. Jamie, we've got to get in there.  
JAMIE: What about the wire?  
DOCTOR: It's too pliable.  
(They hear somebody coming, and hide. The shop door opens, ringing the bell.
Waterfield checks the servant's indicator. The Doctor sneaks up behind the
newcomer.)  
DOCTOR: Boo!  
PERRY: Oh! What are you doing here?  
DOCTOR: You made the appointment.  
PERRY: For ten o'clock.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we thought we'd be early. What are you doing here?  
PERRY: I work here.  
JAMIE: Then what are you creeping about for?  
PERRY: Er.  
JAMIE: Aye.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think you've got some explaining to do, Mister Kenneth Perry.  
PERRY: My name isn't Kenneth, it's Keith. Now look, I don't understand this.  
DOCTOR: So, it's Keith. Do you know a man called Bob Hall?  
PERRY: Well, he's a man Mister Waterfield employs.  
DOCTOR: Well, he keeps some very rough company, including a man called Ken.  
PERRY: Ken. Kennedy?  
DOCTOR: What? What do you know about Kennedy?  
PERRY: Oh, wait a minute. This is all too quick for me. Look, I'll answer your
questions, if you'll answer mine.  
(Waterfield takes the photograph of the Doctor into the secret room, takes a
box out of a valise and tears the photograph in half. He then puts half the
picture in the box to make it look as if it was torn and trapped as the lid
was shut.)  
PERRY: This old police box was for a collector of curios.  
DOCTOR: But it belongs to me.  
PERRY: But why is it so important to you?  
DOCTOR: Because, because of what's inside it and because it happens to be my
property.  
JAMIE: Look, where is it?  
PERRY: At the back.  
DOCTOR: Well, is there another way through? This door is locked.  
PERRY: We might be able to get over the yard gates. You see, this door has an
electric lock on it.  
DOCTOR: You're going to show me where this yard of yours is.  
PERRY: I say, if it's a police box, shouldn't we get the police?  
(The door opens.)  
JAMIE: Doctor.

**[Antique shop study]**

PERRY: That's Kennedy!  
DOCTOR: He's dead.  
JAMIE: What are you doing?  
PERRY: Getting the police. What?  
(There's a buzzing sound on the line. Perry puts the telephone down.)  
PERRY: I don't think you ought to touch anything. I'll be as quick as I can.  
(Perry leaves.)  
JAMIE: Should we have let him go?  
DOCTOR: No, he's doing the right thing.  
JAMIE: But the Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we'll have to find it before he comes back. Now I wonder
what this telephone interference is.  
JAMIE: Looks as if Waterfield's cleared out.  
DOCTOR: Why make an appointment to see us at ten?  
JAMIE: Well, obviously, he didn't know he was going to have a fight with
Kennedy. Och, come on Doctor, lets find the Tardis and go.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the Tardis. Now, how did he die? His limbs are stiff, his
hands clenched. Look, he died in horrible agony. Look at his face. Hello?  
(There is half a photograph in Kennedy's hand.)  
JAMIE: What? It's your picture!  
DOCTOR: Yes. Now, he fell like that, with his arm stretched out. Jamie, go out
into the hall and measure the length of it up to the door here.  
(The Doctor paces out the study.)  
JAMIE: Fourteen, fifteen.  
DOCTOR: It's only five from the door to the wall. There must be another room
behind here.  
JAMIE: Hey Doctor, there's a keyhole.  
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right. Now, Waterfield will have the key. We'd better find
something to prise it open with.  
(The door opens.)

**[Antique shop secret room]**

(Waterfield watches from the study.)  
DOCTOR: Well, look at this. That's where your telephone interference is coming
from. Oh, yes, this is interesting.  
JAMIE: Hey, the other half of your picture.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Don't open that!  
(Too late. A gas makes them collapse. Waterfield enters with a handkerchief
over his mouth and closes the box. He stands in the transmat with the Doctor
and Jamie.)

**[Antique shop]**

(Perry enters with a policeman.)  
PERRY: This way, along here.  
(Meanwhile Waterfield, the Doctor and Jamie dematerialise, along with the
entire transmat apparatus.)

**[Antique shop study]**

PERRY: Here we are. That's funny. There were a couple of other gentlemen here.
They seem to have disappeared.

**[Maxtible's sitting room]**

(Birdsong can be heard through the open doors. The Doctor and Jamie are tucked
up on chairs, with blankets over them. The Doctor wakes, groaning, and there
is a knock at the door. A maid servant enters with a tray.)  
MOLLIE: Hello sir. Are you feeling better? Oh, you did have a party last
night, didn't you sir? The master sent this in for you.  
DOCTOR: The master? Mister Waterfield?  
MOLLIE: Oh, no, sir, Mister Maxtible. Mister Waterfield came back from abroad
last night, sir, with you and the young gentleman. Don't you remember?  
DOCTOR: Not very well, no. Ooh!  
(Mollie pours a glass of liquid for the Doctor, which does him a power of
good.)  
MOLLIE: I'd best not wake him.  
DOCTOR: What's your name?  
MOLLIE: Mollie Dawson, sir.  
DOCTOR: This works remarkably quickly, doesn't it?  
MOLLIE: Am I to pour some more?  
DOCTOR: No. No thank you, Mollie. But, you can tell me what the date is.  
MOLLIE: The date?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm feeling very much better, but I don't seem to be able to
remember the date and where I am.  
MAXTIBLE: Mollie, that will do. The answers you require, sir, might come
better from me. My name is Theodore Maxtible and I am the owner of this house.
Pray, don't get up. I have the greatest sympathy for your condition, since I
was the cause of it.  
(Underneath those whiskers is the wonderful  Marius Goring.)  
DOCTOR: And this is Mister Edward Waterfield, I presume. You don't keep your
appointments, do you?  
WATERFIELD: There were circumstances.  
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed there were.  
MAXTIBLE: Please, please, Doctor. First things first. You asked what date it
was and where you were.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Well?  
MAXTIBLE: You're in my house, some miles from Canterbury. The date is June the
2nd, eighteen hundred and sixty six.  
DOCTOR: And just what do you think you're up to? You steal my property, you
spirit Jamie and me a hundred years back in time and you murder a man along
the way.  
MAXTIBLE: We had nothing to do with the death of that man.  
DOCTOR: I don't believe you!  
MAXTIBLE: You will believe, Doctor. We are all of us the victims of a higher
power. A power more evil and more terrible than the human brain can imagine.  
DOCTOR: Power? Victims? What do you mean?  
WATERFIELD: They've taken my daughter, Victoria.  
DOCTOR: Who are they?  
MAXTIBLE: You will not be kept in suspense very much longer, Doctor. Pray,
come with us and we will show you how it all began.  
WATERFIELD: Doctor, do whatever it is they ask, I beg of you. My daughter's
life is in your hands.  
DOCTOR: I will listen, I promise.  
(Waterfield is looking at a portrait over the fireplace.)  
DOCTOR: Is that your daughter?  
WATERFIELD: No, sir. That is a painting of my wife as a young girl. She is
dead now, rest her soul, but Victoria is the image of her.

**[Victoria's room]**

(Victoria is feeding the birds through the bars at her window when the door
opens.)  
DALEK: You have not eaten. You will eat. That is an order. Answer!  
VICTORIA: Yes.  
DALEK: You will not feed the flying pests outside. Answer!  
VICTORIA: Yes.  
DALEK: Move to the machine. Move!  
(Victoria steps between two columns of lights, and there is a brain-splitting
whine.  
VICTORIA: No, no.  
(The numbers on the wall read 111-968, 2113-4, 7582-1)  
DALEK: Move. Move! The weight of your body has fallen by seventeen ounces.  
VICTORIA: What do you expect? What do you expect? For pity's sake, let me go!  
DALEK: Speak when you are told to speak! More food will come. Eat it, or you
will be fed by force!

**[Maxtible's laboratory]**

(Lots of bubbling retorts and rubber tubing.)  
MAXTIBLE: Here we are, Doctor. This is hallowed ground. Here we shall not be
disturbed by the servants.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, very impressive. And now perhaps you'll explain what all
this is about?  
MAXTIBLE: Patience, my dear sir, a little longer.  
DOCTOR: Patience? You don't seem to understand what's happened. A man has been
murdered! You behave as though we're going on Sunday school outing.  
MAXTIBLE: Neither Whitefield nor I were responsible for his death. A cigar?  
DOCTOR: Why have you brought us here? Who are these enemies of yours, these
ones you say control you?  
MAXTIBLE: Brilliant minds, Doctor.  
WATERFIELD: They are monsters.  
MAXTIBLE: Oh, I admit, Waterfield, they have behaved callously.  
WATERFIELD: Inhuman monsters!  
DOCTOR: Inhuman?  
WATERFIELD: Creations of the devil!  
MAXTIBLE: Let me explain.  
DOCTOR: Please do.  
MAXTIBLE: I have always been fascinated by the concept of travelling through
time. Waterfield here is an expert in certain technical matters and I have the
money to indulge my whims. Everything you see about you here was constructed
by us two.  
DOCTOR: To try to find a way of exploring time?  
MAXTIBLE: Yes. Now this is my theory. A mirror reflects an image, does it not?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
MAXTIBLE: So, you may be standing there, and yet appear to be standing fifty
feet away. Well, following the new investigations twelve years ago by J Clark
Maxwell into electromagnetism and the experiments by Faraday into static
electricity.  
DOCTOR: Static?  
MAXTIBLE: Correct. Waterfield and I first attempted to refine the image in the
mirror, and then to project it. In here, Doctor, are one hundred and forty
four separate mirrors.  
(They are behind a pair of gothic pointed doors.)  
WATERFIELD: And each is of polished metal. Each is subjected to electric
charges, all positive.  
MAXTIBLE: Like repels like in electricity, Doctor, and so next, Waterfield and
I attempted to repel the image in the mirrors, wherever we directed.  
DOCTOR: You mentioned static electricity.  
WATERFIELD: That was our last experiment. Negative and positive electricity
had failed, so we tried static. If only we could have known the powers we were
going to unleash.  
DOCTOR: Powers?  
WATERFIELD: In the middle of our final test with static, creatures burst out
of the cabinet, invaded the house, took away my daughter.  
MAXTIBLE: Oh, my dear fellow. My dear, dear fellow. But we shall win through
now that the Doctor is here.  
DOCTOR: These creatures?  
WATERFIELD: We had opened the way for them with our experiments. They forced
me into the horror of time travel, Doctor. They ordered me to steal a box
belonging to you and thus lure you into a trap and transport you here,
together with your colleague Mister McCrimmon.  
DOCTOR: They knew about me, these creatures.  
MAXTIBLE: They gave us likenesses.  
WATERFIELD: What could I do? They said my daughter would die.  
DOCTOR: What are they called, these creatures?  
DALEK: Doctor! Now do you understand?  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Perfectly.  
DALEK: Move back! Our plan has worked. We shall triumph! You will obey! You
will obey!  
DOCTOR: Obey? Obey? What do you want?  
DALEK: We have your time ship. We will destroy it unless you help us with an
experiment.  
DOCTOR: What experiment?  
DALEK: You will help the Daleks test another human being.  
DOCTOR: What sort of test?  
DALEK: Do not question!  
DOCTOR: I will not be your slave!  
WATERFIELD: Doctor, I beg you.  
DALEK: No harm will come to you if you agree. Where is your companion?  
DOCTOR: Jamie?  
WATERFIELD: He is in the house. I have done everything you asked me to.  
DOCTOR: Why do you ask about Jamie?  
DALEK: He is the human being who is to be tested.  
DOCTOR: What do you mean? Tested how?  
DALEK: Silence! You will reveal nothing to your companion. Obey the Daleks!
You are in our power!  
(The Dalek goes into the mirrored room.)  
DOCTOR: What have you done with your infernal meddling? What is this test? Do
either of you know?  
WATERFIELD: No.  
MAXTIBLE: I believe I do. They, I mean the Daleks, tell me they have always
been defeated by human beings.  
DOCTOR: In the long run, yes.  
MAXTIBLE: Possibly because of some factor, possessed by human beings  
DOCTOR: Possibly.  
MAXTIBLE: That is absent in Daleks.  
DOCTOR: Possibly.  
MAXTIBLE: Perhaps they want to find out what it is and transplant it into
their race.  
WATERFIELD: But if they do that, allied with their own alien intelligence,
they'll be invincible! Maxtible, you should've  
MAXTIBLE: Oh, my dear fellow. I am merely surmising. I know nothing definite.
But, besides, what could we have done? Even if I had known for certain, the
fact was, nay is, they hold your daughter, Victoria.  
DOCTOR: And now they've got Jamie.

**[Maxtible's sitting room]**

MOLLIE: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to wake you. There.  
(Jamie clutches his head.)  
JAMIE: Oh, it's not funny. Oh.  
MOLLIE: The master left this for you to drink, sir. This'll clear away the
cobwebs. Here you are, sir.  
JAMIE: Where's the Doctor? Oh.  
MOLLIE: He's with the master and Mister Waterfield, sir.  
JAMIE: Waterfield?  
RUTH: Mollie? What are you doing here?  
(Welcome  Brigit Forsyth, everyone.)  
MOLLIE: Just seeing to the young gentleman, miss.  
RUTH: Go and bring some tea. Well, go along.  
(Mollie leaves.)  
RUTH: Please, Mister McCrimmon.  
JAMIE: You know my name?  
RUTH: My father told me that you and your friend arrived last night with
Mister Waterfield.  
JAMIE: Your father? I'm sorry but I seem to have great difficulty in
remembering anything.  
RUTH: He owns this house. I'm his daughter, Ruth Maxtible.  
JAMIE: How do you do? Have you seen the Doctor this morning?  
RUTH: He's talking with my father. He'll be along presently. Do you have
everything you need?  
JAMIE: I don't know what this stuff is, but it seems to work all right.  
RUTH: Mollie shall bring you some tea in a minute.  
JAMIE: I'm obliged to you. Er, Miss Maxtible?  
RUTH: Yes?  
JAMIE: Could you tell me who that is in the portrait?  
RUTH: That's a portrait of Mister Waterfield's late wife.  
JAMIE: She was very lovely.  
RUTH: Yes, and his daughter looks just like her. You're quite comfortable?  
JAMIE: Yes. Thank you.  
(Ruth leaves. Jamie starts to search a writing bureau as a ruffian enters
through the French windows and hides behind a curtain. He is played by
Windsor Davies.)  
JAMIE: Eighteen sixty six. So that's what Waterfield's done.  
(Jamie looks around the room then picks up his blanket and moves his chair to
face the couch. Toby the ruffian hits him over the back of the head then
leaves when there is a knocking on the door.)  
MOLLIE: Here we are sir. I've been as quick as I could. Shall I pour for you?
Poor young gentleman. They shouldn't have given you so much to drink.  
(Toby returns and grabs Mollie from behind with his hand over her mouth.)

**[Maxtible's hallway]**

WATERFIELD: Doctor, I do ask you to consider.  
DOCTOR: I have made up my mind.  
MAXTIBLE: But they ordered you not to tell your friend McCrimmon anything.  
DOCTOR: Do you think I'm going to allow Jamie to run into danger without
telling him anything? No, I will not.  
MAXTIBLE: But suppose he refuses to do what they want?  
DOCTOR: We shall see.

**[Maxtible's sitting room]**

DOCTOR: He's still asleep. The gas in that box of yours was pretty potent.  
WATERFIELD: It was Maxtible's invention.  
DOCTOR: Jamie.  
(But it is not Jamie under the blanket.)  
WATERFIELD: Mollie!

**[Maxtible's laboratory]**

DALEK: Order the Doctor to begin the test.  
MAXTIBLE: But I must first explain to him what he has to do.  
DALEK: Go now. Obey the Daleks!

**[Maxtible's sitting room]**

(The Doctor is examining marks on the floor with his magnifying glass.)  
WATERFIELD: But your friend is vital to the plan of these Daleks. Absolutely
essential.  
DOCTOR: So it seems. So who can have kidnapped him?  
WATERFIELD: Oh, why won't you understand? The threats they make are not idle
ones. Kennedy was murdered. Without your friend, our only hope is gone unless,
unless you know something. You seem to be well acquainted with the creatures.  
DOCTOR: Everything you say, Waterfield, is true. If we cannot find Jamie, the
Daleks will take pleasure in killing everyone in sight, and their greatest
pleasure will be in killing me.

**[Dalek's room]**

DALEK: The humans have been told to begin the test.  
DALEK 2: Any delay will result in death.  
DALEK: There will be no delay.  

__**Episode Three**__

**[Maxtible's sitting room]**

WATERFIELD: Mollie, Mollie. Mister McCrimmon has been kidnapped. It means the
end of us unless we can find him quickly.  
DOCTOR: Straw.  
WATERFIELD: I beg your pardon?  
DOCTOR: A piece of straw.  
(It was stuck in the mud by the French windows.)

**[Stables]**

TOBY: Had a cosy little sleep, young swell?  
(Jamie pushes him away.)  
TOBY: Lively, is it? Maybe you'd like to sleep again? I've got Mister Nod
here. He'll have you snoring as good as ever.  
JAMIE: What do you want?  
TOBY: I'm to be well paid. Have no fear of that.  
JAMIE: Aye, and for what? I don't know you.  
(Another man enters. He is very well-spoken.)  
TOBY: This your man, sir?  
TERRALL: Toby! What in Hades have you done?  
TOBY: Why, I brought him from the house, like you said.  
TERRALL: I said nothing of the kind.  
TOBY: Well, you did, sir. Honest you did. A guinea you promised me, and I done
what you said. You don't get out of paying.  
TERRALL: Be careful how you speak to me, Toby. There's your money. Get out!  
(Toby picks up the coin and leaves. Terrall steps towards Jamie then stops. He
appears to be in great pain. Then he is suddenly normal again.)  
TERRALL: Where's Toby?  
JAMIE: You just sent him about his business. Look, what's the matter? Are you
all right?  
TERRALL: Where's Victoria Waterfield?  
JAMIE: I don't know.  
TERRALL: Yes, you do.  
JAMIE: I tell you, I don't even know her.  
TERRALL: You're in the house, a friend of Maxtible's. You must know.  
JAMIE: No, listen, I'm telling  
(Terrall grimaces in pain again, then recovers.)  
TERRALL: Ah ha, I must apologise for that villain Toby. He was telling lies,
of course. I shall escort you to the house.  
JAMIE: You just asked me about Victoria Waterfield.  
TERRALL: She's in Paris. I'm afraid I haven't introduced myself. Arthur
Terrall.  
JAMIE: No, never mind about that. Did you or did you not, ask that man to
knock me on the head and bring me in here?  
TERRALL: I, oh certainly not!  
JAMIE: Oh. Doctor!  
(The DOCTOR enters.)  
TERRALL: Oh. I see you're in good hands now. I won't detain you any further.
Good day, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oh, good day to you.  
(Terrall leaves.)  
JAMIE: He's mad. Stark, staring mad.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. I was listening. Let's have a look at that head of yours.  
JAMIE: Och, it's all right.  
DOCTOR: Come along.  
JAMIE: One minute he says this, the next minute he says that. Can you make it
out, Doctor? I'm knocked on the head and I'm brought in here. Then that man
Terrall enters and denies having ordered the other man to do it. Well, then he
changes, and he starts asking about Victoria Waterfield and in the next
breath, he tells me she's in Paris.  
DOCTOR: I know what's happened to Victoria.  
JAMIE: What has?  
DOCTOR: She's a prisoner of the Daleks.

**[Victoria's room]**

DALEK: Hurry!  
VICTORIA: Why am I being moved? Are you taking me back to my father?  
DALEK: No. You are being moved. Pick up your cover. Follow. Do not be afraid.
You are not to be exterminated.

**[Corridor]**

DALEK: Do not delay.  
(Victoria stops at a window to look outside at the gardens.)  
DALEK 2: Move.

**[Maxtible's sitting room]**

WATERFIELD: You warned him, told him about the Daleks?  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I did!  
WATERFIELD: But you were expressly told  
DOCTOR: Oh, fiddlesticks! Bosh! Jamie will cooperate. You may be certain of
that.  
WATERFIELD: Are you sure?  
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly sure. Jamie will do everything he is asked to do. Now
come along, we must go and find Maxtible.  
(Jamie has overheard this, and is worried.)

**[Maxtible's laboratory]**

(Maxtible is working when a Dalek comes out of the mirrored room.)  
DALEK: The female human being has been moved.  
MAXTIBLE: Everything is prepared.  
DALEK: The testing equipment is ready?  
MAXTIBLE: I think you will be pleased with the man I have had specially
brought from London. He works in my house.  
DALEK: Show me.  
MAXTIBLE: You will understand that he is rather simple. He is quite dumb, but
that has its advantages for us. His mind is, how shall I say, undeveloped. He
will not understand you, the Daleks. I mean, he will be terrified of you.  
DALEK: Show me.  
MAXTIBLE: Oh, I beg your pardon.  
(The Dalek backs into the mirrored room to watch. Maxtible calls into the
corridor.)  
MAXTIBLE: Kemel!  
(A giant man appears, in traditional Turkish dress.)  
MAXTIBLE: Will you come with me? I want you to stand here. No, no, no, no, no,
face the cabinet. Good.  
(Maxtible gives Kemel a thick iron bar.)  
MAXTIBLE: Now, bend that.  
(Kemel tests the bar against his leg, then removes his waistcoat and shirt and
starts to bend the bar against the back of his neck. Then he removes it and
finishes the job with upper body strength alone.)  
MAXTIBLE: Excellent, Kemel, excellent. Now, you'll help me with these stools.  
(Maxtible puts two stools a short distance apart and puts a thick plank of
wood across the top.)  
MAXTIBLE: There. Now, Kemel, one blow. Break the plank!  
(He does so with one fist.)  
MAXTIBLE: Very good, Kemel. I'm very pleased with you. Now you can put on your
jacket. Come over here. Now, I want you to listen carefully. You see this man?  
(He shows Kemel a photograph of Jamie.)  
MAXTIBLE: Now, I'm going to take you to a place that I want you to guard. This
young man will try and get past you and you are not to let him. Do you
understand? Oh, he's an evil villain, Kemel. A cutthroat who would gladly
murder us all in our beds if he could. You will remember this man? Right.
Well, you come with me and I will direct you.  
(Maxtible and Kemel leave, and the Dalek comes out to look closely at the bent
iron bar.)

**[Alcove]**

MAXTIBLE: You wait here.  
(Maxtible takes a candle and matches from an upper shelf.)  
MAXTIBLE: This is the entrance to the south wing of my house, and through here
will pass the man I showed you in the picture. The door itself is an obstacle.  
(Maxtible presses a hidden switch and a door at the back of the alcove opens.)  
MAXTIBLE: No, no, wait!  
(Maxtible stops Kemel getting speared by metal spikes that thud down across
the entrance. He presses a second switch and the spikes retract.)  
MAXTIBLE: Now, if he gets through here, you will deal with him. Go now.  
(Kemel moves down the corridor. Maxtible closes the alcove door and blows out
the candle.)

**[Maxtible's laboratory]**

DALEK: We do not trust you.  
DOCTOR: Then we're quits, aren't we?  
DALEK: But we have your time machine.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
DALEK: So, you will obey us.  
DOCTOR: They want the human Factor, is that right?  
WATERFIELD: Yes, that is what they want.  
DOCTOR: Very complex. And you want to introduce this human factor into the
race of Daleks?  
DALEK: Yes, the conquest of humanity has eluded us. The Daleks must know why.  
DOCTOR: Well why choose Jamie for this test?  
DALEK: His travelling with you makes him unique.  
DOCTOR: But why him, why not me?  
DALEK: Request denied.  
DOCTOR: Why?  
DALEK: You have travelled too much through time. You are more than human.  
DOCTOR: I see. What is this?  
(Three large packing cases beside the workbench. Maxtible enters.)  
MAXTIBLE: They have been brought from the Dalek planet.  
DOCTOR: Skaro?  
DALEK: Yes.  
(Maxtible removes the lid from one case. Inside is a Dalek without its metal
casing.)  
DALEK: their life force is dormant. Before it is activated, we want  
DOCTOR: You want the human factor introduced. I see.  
DALEK: You will obey us.  
DOCTOR: I will make up my own mind!  
WATERFIELD: Do not antagonise them, Doctor. They will destroy your time
machine.  
DOCTOR: And if I agree, it means the creation of a race of super Daleks. My
Tardis. I have no choice, do I. Very well, I agree.  
DALEK: The human being with you must not be aware of the trial.  
DOCTOR: I quite understand.  
DALEK: Make him begin the test.  
(The Dalek goes into the mirrored room.)  
DOCTOR: What must Jamie do?  
MAXTIBLE: Attempt to rescue Waterfield's daughter.

**[Maxtible's sitting room]**

(Jamie is waiting when Mollie shows in Ruth and Terrall.)  
MOLLIE: There we are, sir.  
RUTH: Thank you, Mollie. Arthur, I'd like you to meet Mister McCrimmon.  
TERRALL: May I ask what you are doing in this house?  
JAMIE: I was just about to ask you the same thing.  
RUTH: Oh, you gentlemen have been introduced?  
JAMIE: Aye, we've met.  
TERRALL: It seems, Ruth, your father has the oddest collection of house guests
these days.  
RUTH: Now, Arthur, please. You must forgive him, Mister McCrimmon.  
JAMIE: Ah, it's becoming a habit.  
TERRALL: I don't care for insolence.  
JAMIE: Well, I'm not keen on arrogance myself.  
RUTH: Why, you bite at each other as if you were old enemies.  
JAMIE: I'm sorry if I seem rude.  
RUTH: Come, I want you to be friends. Won't you be so, to please me?  
(Terrall has another painful attack.)  
RUTH: Arthur? Arthur, what is it?  
(Terrall runs from the room.)  
RUTH: Excuse me. Arthur! What's the matter?  
(Ruth follows Terrall. Shortly afterwards, Mollie enters.)  
MOLLIE: Sir?  
JAMIE: Yes? Oh, I wish you'd call me Jamie.  
MOLLIE: Oh, I couldn't do that, sir. What would the master say?  
JAMIE: Oh, who cares? What can I do for you?  
MOLLIE: If you'd tell me where your bags are, sir, yours and the Doctor, I'll
have them taken up to your room.  
JAMIE: Aye. Well, Mollie  
MOLLIE: Listen to me. Have them taken. I daresay I'll be doing it meself!  
JAMIE: You see, we didn't have time to pick up the luggage. It'll be
following.  
MOLLIE: Oh.  
JAMIE: Why do you say you'll be doing it yourself?  
MOLLIE: Well, they do say, sir, that the house is haunted. Mister Kitson, the
butler, left, and cook and the two footmen are complaining again.  
JAMIE: Haunted?  
MOLLIE: Mmm. But, I've never heard anything, sir. I sleep like a log and
always have.  
JAMIE: Aye. Well, I'm glad you've got over the fright you had.  
MOLLIE: Oh, yes, that horrible man. Miss Ruth said it was all a game, but I
don't know, sir. I've never fainted before, sir. Truly I haven't.  
JAMIE: Not sir, Jamie. Tell me about Arthur Terrall.  
MOLLIE: Miss Ruth's fianc�, sir?  
JAMIE: Aye.  
MOLLIE: Oh. Oh, he's a kind man, sir. Usually.  
JAMIE: Usually?  
MOLLIE: Mmm. Well, when he's a bit odd or his temper's up, as it has been
lately, I says to myself, Inkerman, and then it's all right.  
JAMIE: Inkerman?  
MOLLIE: Yes sir. He was out in the Crimea, he was. They do say Mister Terrall
was wounded out there.  
(The Doctor enters quietly.)  
MOLLIE: Do you know, my uncle was killed at Inkerman, sir. So, you see, I do
know what it's like with soldiers. Oh! oh, I'm sorry, sir.  
DOCTOR: It's all right, Mollie.  
MOLLIE: I didn't mean to.  
DOCTOR: Never mind.  
MOLLIE: Well, cook said to me that if I did some dusting it would be all
right.  
DOCTOR: That'll do. Yes, Mollie, thank you very much. It's all right.  
MOLLIE: You won't tell the master, will you?  
DOCTOR: I wouldn't dream of telling him.  
MOLLIE: Thank you, sir. Sorry.  
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. Bye bye.  
(Mollie leaves.)  
DOCTOR: You'll have to brush up on your history. I can't be around to cover up
for you all the time. Now then, in the Crimean War, the English, the French
and the Turks fought the Russians.  
JAMIE: Oh, forget about all that!  
DOCTOR: Oh, I thought you'd be interested. I watched the Charge of the Light
Brigade. Magnificent folly.  
JAMIE: Look, where've you been?  
DOCTOR: Oh, just looking around.  
JAMIE: Aye. What for, the Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Jamie, you're in a temper!  
JAMIE: Oh, am I? Is that bad, then? Does that mean I won't be co-operative. I
won't do everything I'm told?  
DOCTOR: What was that?  
JAMIE: I overheard you and Waterfield.  
DOCTOR: You were eavesdropping.  
JAMIE: Well, whatever it is, I don't like what you're doing.  
DOCTOR: Now, you listen to me, Jamie!  
JAMIE: No, Doctor. You're forgetting the Tardis was stolen and a man was
murdered. Now, how am I supposed to tell when I see you as friendly as you
like with the murderer.  
DOCTOR: Waterfield did not murder that man!  
JAMIE: All right, then. But he stole the Tardis and that still makes him a
thief.  
DOCTOR: The Daleks forced him to!  
JAMIE: The Daleks! You keep telling me about the Daleks, and I haven't even
seen one. You're always on about them, but where are they?  
DOCTOR: Now, you listen to me.  
JAMIE: No, you'll not get round me this time, Doctor. You're up to something
with Waterfield and Maxtible. Now what is it? Some scientific invention? Ah,
here's your friend.  
DOCTOR: Just a little argument.  
WATERFIELD: I heard voices raised.  
JAMIE: That's not all you'll hear!  
DOCTOR: Jamie seems to think that I'm lying to him.  
JAMIE: Well, aren't you?  
DOCTOR: He doesn't believe the Daleks are here.  
WATERFIELD: It's the truth.  
JAMIE: Aye, the truth you told Arthur Terrall, maybe, that your daughter was
in Paris.  
WATERFIELD: I had to tell him that.  
JAMIE: So you've got another story to tell me?  
WATERFIELD: I tell you that the Daleks are holding my daughter prisoner in the
south wing of this house, Mister McCrimmon.  
JAMIE: Then why don't you try and get her back, ay? What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Well, what can I do? Now, be fair, Jamie. Waterfield's tied hand and
foot because of his daughter, and we're tied hand and foot because of the
Tardis!  
JAMIE: Aye, and that's all you can think about, isn't it? The Tardis. Well,
you can all stand around doing nothing. I'm sick to death of it.  
DOCTOR: Now just where are you going?  
JAMIE: To be by myself for a bit. Do you mind?  
DOCTOR: No, not a bit. But one word of warning. Don't you try to be a one-man
army. You leave well alone. I won't have you ruining everything trying to
rescue Victoria Waterfield. Now, you understand?  
(Jamie pushes the Doctor out of his way and leaves.)  
WATERFIELD: Well, are you sure you didn't go a little too far, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Adding a little fuel to the fire. Tell Maxtible that I'll be along to
his laboratory shortly.  
WATERFIELD: Oh, very well, Doctor, if you're sure.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, quite sure. Once our young friend has cooled his heels a bit,
he'll launch off on his own. And you dropped the hint about the south wing
beautifully.

**[Stables]**

TERRALL: Well, what is it? You wanted to see me.  
TOBY: Very good of you to talk to me, gov'nor.  
TERRALL: Well, never mind all that. I'll give you two minutes, no more.  
TOBY: I want me rights. No more, no less.  
TERRALL: What do you mean, rights?  
TOBY: Half a guinea, you gave me, and it ain't what we said.  
TERRALL: You were lucky to get anything.  
TOBY: That ain't fair.  
TERRALL: You'll get no more from me. I warn you, keep away from this house and
this property. Find the nearest road to London and take it.  
TOBY: Oh, yeah, London, sir. Yeah. I daresay I could earn something for me
stories there.  
TERRALL: Stories?  
TOBY: Oh, I won't detain an important gentleman like yourself. Like as not me
two minutes is up anyway.  
TERRALL: What do you mean, stories?  
TOBY: It's all right, sir. I'll take a stroll to London.  
TERRALL: Don't play with me.  
TOBY: Get off me. If you must know, there's plenty who'd pay to hear what I've
got to tell them.  
TERRALL: Indeed.  
TOBY: Yeah. You blows too hot and cold for me, telling me this one minute and
that the next and not paying up.  
TERRALL: You know nothing.  
TOBY: Don't I, though?  
TERRALL: Who'd believe you anyway?  
TOBY: Pay me off, and there's the end of it.  
TERRALL: Oh, blackmail is it? Get out.  
(Toby starts to leave, but Terrall has one of his attacks, grabs a pitchfork
and lunges at Toby. Toby manages to knock him out. He searches his pockets and
finds gold coins and a set of keys.)  
TOBY: Maybe I don't know much to tell, but I'll wager I'll find something in
the house that's worth me trouble. So I'll say thank you, Mister Terrall, sir.

**[Maxtible's sitting room]**

(The moon shines down on the house. Mollie brings an oil lamp in.)  
JAMIE: It's only me, Mollie.  
MOLLIE: It's over here, sir. I took it from the master's study.  
JAMIE: It's marvellous. Thank you.  
MOLLIE: Here, is this what you wanted?  
(It's a plan of the house.)  
JAMIE: Perfect, yes. Let's see. This is the south wing here?  
MOLLIE: Yes sir, but it's been closed off.  
JAMIE: Completely?  
MOLLIE: Oh no, sir. only because of some repairs about a twelve month back.
But the door may be locked.  
JAMIE: Can you show me?  
MOLLIE: All right.  
(Jamie takes the map and lamp.)  
MOLLIE: What're you going to do, sir?  
JAMIE: I'm off to hunt a few ghosties, Mollie.

**[Workroom]**

DOCTOR: Every single one of Jamie's reactions will be recorded on these Dalek
machines.  
MAXTIBLE: And then transformed into thought patterns on silver wire. A
wonderful creation.  
DALEK1: It is for you, Doctor, to select the major feelings to make up this
human factor.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. I quite understand.  
MAXTIBLE: We can rely on the Doctor to give us all cooperation.  
DALEK: We shall watch your every move.  
DOCTOR: I'm sure you will. And every step of Jamie's progress will be covered?  
DALEK: Yes.  
DALEK 2: The young human being is on his way.  
MAXTIBLE: Then the recording machines can be set in action.

**[Alcove]**

(Mollie leads Jamie to the hidden doorway.)  
JAMIE: Here?  
MOLLIE: Yes, sir. I once remember the master stepping away from here. When he
saw me, he was very cross and told me to keep away.  
JAMIE: I see.  
(Jamie searches the alcove.)

**[Maxtible's laboratory]**

(Toby has got into the house using Terrall's keys and is searching the place
for loot. He looks into a packing case then is aware of movement on the other
side of the room. A Dalek glides towards him. Toby tries to run and gets
killed, screaming as he dies.)

**[Alcove]**

(The scream is heard through the house.)  
MOLLIE: What was that? What was that?  
JAMIE: That was no ghost, Mollie, that's for sure. That was a human voice.  
MOLLIE: Oh, sir.  
JAMIE: Look, Mollie, take the candle and go back to your room. Will you do
that?  
MOLLIE: Yes, sir.  
JAMIE: Now, do you want me to see you safely there?  
MOLLIE: No, no. I'll be all right.  
(Mollie leaves. Jamie finds the candle and matches on the shelf and lights it.
He finds greasy fingerprints on the doorframe and the hidden switches. The
door opens. As Jamie moves forward, hot wax drips onto his fingers and he
stops to wipe it off just as the metal spikes thud down in front of him. Jamie
ducks under the spikes into the next corridor.)

**[South wing]**

(Jamie sees movement in the moonlit corridor. It is Kemel.)  
JAMIE: Hello. Who are you?

__**Episode Four**__

**[South wing]**

(Kemel steps forward, arms outstretched. Jamie ducks underneath them. Kemel
grabs Jamie's fist and squeezes it. Jamie shoulders Kemel's stomach and the
wrestler staggers back releasing his hand. They circle each other until Jamie
elbows Kemel in the stomach again with no effect. Kemel gets a glancing blow
on Jamie, knocking him down. Then Kemel kicks out and Jamie grabs his foot,
making him fall backwards onto a chair which breaks. Next, Kemel gets Jamie in
a headlock but Jamie gets his foot behind Kemel's knee and overbalances them
both. They exchange kicks and blows until Kemel hits his head against the
wall. Jamie goes into the nearest room and shuts the door.)

**[South wing room]**

(It is full of dusty furniture and packing cases. Kemel rushes in. Jamie
dodges at the last moment and Kemel goes out through an open window. Jamie
looks out to see Kemel sliding down a small roof until he is just hanging on
to the gutter two stories above the ground. Jamie throws down a rope and
braces himself as the wrestler climbs back up to safety. Meanwhile, A Dalek
takes an embroidered lace handkerchief into Victoria's old room and puts it on
the floor. Kemel climbs back through the window and shakes his head. Jamie
goes back to the corridor and Kemel does not follow.)

**[Victoria's room]**

(Jamie passes an open doorway and sees the handkerchief on the floor. He looks
around and goes to pick it up. Suddenly Kemel knocks him over onto the bed. An
axe swings out of the wall and slices through the air where Jamie had been
standing. The pair continue the search together. A Dalek watches them go.)

**[Dalek laboratory]**

DOCTOR: It took courage to fight Maxtible's Turkish wrestler.  
DALEK: The Daleks are afraid of nothing and no-one.  
DOCTOR: But Jamie saved the Turk's life.  
DALEK: Human weakness.  
DOCTOR: If he hadn't, he would have died in that room of yours. If you want
the human factor, a part of it must include mercy.

**[Maxtible's laboratory]**

WATERFIELD: What is he doing here?  
MAXTIBLE: (A common thief, come to see what he could steal. No mystery here.  
(A Dalek comes out of the mirror room.)  
DALEK: The intruder was destroyed.  
WATERFIELD: Well, what are we to do? Where is the Doctor? He must be told.  
DALEK: No.  
WATERFIELD: Why not?  
DALEK: Obey me!  
MAXTIBLE: Waterfield, I beg of you, do not antagonise the, er, our friends.  
WATERFIELD: Oh, why do you consistently avoid reality, Maxtible? Another man
has died. Can't you grasp that fact?  
DALEK: You will hide the remains of the dead human intruder.  
WATERFIELD: No!  
DALEK: That is an order!  
MAXTIBLE: We must do as they say, Waterfield. We cannot anger them. Here.
Here, wrap the body in this.  
WATERFIELD: No.  
MAXTIBLE: We must. Have you lost your mind? Don't you want to see your
daughter again?  
WATERFIELD: There's no end to this. The hands of the Devil.  
DALEK: Dispose of the body. Obey!  
MAXTIBLE: Waterfield, what is the matter with you? We are not to blame for
everything that has happened. No English judge or jury would find it in their
hearts to convict us of one solitary thing.  
WATERFIELD: It'll never come to that.  
MAXTIBLE: And what may that remark mean?  
WATERFIELD: I have one purpose only, to see my daughter out of the hands of
those foul monsters. When that is achieved, I shall confess my part in all
that has happened.  
(As Waterfield finishes wrapping Toby's corpse in a sheet, Maxtible opens a
drawer in his workbench and removes a small pistol which he slips into his
coat. Waterfield struggles to drag the body to the door.)  
WATERFIELD: You must help me.  
MAXTIBLE: I am at your heels, my dear sir.

**[South wing]**

(Kemel helps Jamie to a window for some fresh air.)  
JAMIE: That's better, thank you. Aye, you're an odd one. I'll say that. Aye,
well, I suppose we're both a bit touched, eh? Knocking each other about the
place and saving one another's lives. You don't say much, do you?  
(Kemel touches his lips and shakes his head.)  
JAMIE: Oh, I see. You can't talk. Aye. Well, you're a sight better than a
number of people I know who can. I wonder what your name is?  
(The Turk writes his name in the dust.)  
JAMIE: Kemel? Well, I'm Jamie.  
(Kemel bows over Jamie's hand.)  
JAMIE: Hey, what is that? Now, come on now. I want none of that. We're to be
friends, d'you hear? Friends.  
(Kemel sees the handkerchief Jamie is holding.)  
JAMIE: Aye.  
(Kemel points to the initials on it.)  
JAMIE: V.W. I know. Victoria Waterfield.  
(Kemel pulls a piece of folded paper from his belt. It contains a pressed
flower.)  
JAMIE: Oh, Miss Waterfield gave you the flower? You like her? Of course. Then
what are we fighting for? Do you not know what I'm doing here, Kemel? Victoria
Waterfield is being held a prisoner here somewhere. Together? Aye, we'll go
together. There's no one I'd rather have with me.

**[Dalek laboratory]**

(The Doctor adjusts the recording machine.)

**[Stables]**

(Waterfield and Maxtible carry in Toby's body and put it in a stall.)  
WATERFIELD: What was that? Did you hear it?  
MAXTIBLE: Control your nerves.  
WATERFIELD: But there was a noise.  
MAXTIBLE: Waterfield, go back to the house.  
WATERFIELD: No, we have a task to perform.  
MAXTIBLE: Waterfield, I am sick to death of you.  
WATERFIELD: What?  
MAXTIBLE: I take you into my house, you and your daughter, provide for you.  
WATERFIELD: Yes, I know everything that you've done.  
MAXTIBLE: Small thanks do I get for it. I did not bring these terrible
creatures here deliberately, you know that. Am I to blame for everything?  
WATERFIELD: No, no.  
MAXTIBLE: It is your daughter they have kidnapped. One moment you beg me to do
everything I can to rescue her, next moment you blame me.  
WATERFIELD: Yes, I don't mean it like that. It's the price. First Kennedy, now
this fellow. How many people must die so that my daughter can live?  
MAXTIBLE: We are not the murderers.  
WATERFIELD: No, just the silent partners. But we're equally to blame because
we stand by and do nothing.  
MAXTIBLE: Go back to the house, Waterfield. I understand you are under a
stress. You try and get some sleep.  
WATERFIELD: Sleep? I've not had one good night's rest since this started.  
MAXTIBLE: Well, you go back to your room. Near the end now. You have done
enough.  
(Waterfield leaves. Maxtible aims his pistol at his back. Terrall steps out of
the shadows and knocks the gun away.)  
MAXTIBLE: What are you doing?  
TERRALL: Waterfield does not die yet.  
MAXTIBLE: He says he will confess everything.  
TERRALL: Go back to the laboratory. I will dispose of the body. You will obey.
You will obey!

**[South wing]**

(Jamie and Kemel hide in an alcove as a Dalek goes past.)  
JAMIE: Wait. Never mind about those, Kemel, unless they catch sight of us. We
seem to be going in the right direction.  
(They follow the Dalek at a distance, but they are being monitored in the
Dalek laboratory. Jamie touches a small button in the wall at waist height and
an alarm sounds.)  
JAMIE: Down!  
(A spotlight glares down and a huge ball on a pendulum swings between them,
just missing their heads as they lie on the floor. Jamie and Kemel continue
along the corridor very carefully.)

**[Dalek laboratory]**

(The Doctor makes more adjustments.)  
DALEK: We do not trust you. What thoughts are you using now?  
DOCTOR: Human beings have five senses. Sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch.
But there is instinct, too. Jamie used instinct to avoid your trap.

**[Banqueting hall]**

(The corridor ends in a large hall with an open fireplace, and a minstrel's
gallery at the far end. As Jamie watches, two Daleks enter and look up at the
gallery. A door opens and Victoria steps out.)  
DALEK: Name?  
VICTORIA: Victoria.  
DALEK: Louder.  
VICTORIA: Victoria! Victoria Waterfield! You know my name!  
DALEK: Silence. Inspection is over. Return to your room.  
JAMIE: She's very beautiful, Kemel.  
(Kemel smiles and takes a mace from the wall.)  
JAMIE: What are you going to do with that? You'll attack the Daleks, draw them
off down the corridor, while I go up there and rescue her somehow? It's too
dangerous, Kemel. Besides, it needs two of us up there. Oh, but how?

**[Dalek laboratory]**

DALEK: What is the significance of this thought pattern?  
DOCTOR: Suicidal attacks to gain an objective. Postulate. Self-preservation is
a strong human factor. Jamie and his new friend are determined to succeed, but
finding the girl is only part. Getting her away is another.

**[Trophy room]**

(Terrall drags Mollie inside.)  
TERRALL: You'll come in here, Mollie, and explain yourself.  
MOLLIE: Oh, sir, please, sir, You're hurting me!  
TERRALL: Now, what is this hysterical nonsense?  
MOLLIE: But, sir, I heard Miss Victoria's voice.  
TERRALL: Did she say how the weather was in Paris? That's where she is,
Mollie.  
MOLLIE: Well, I know that, sir, but I heard her speaking.  
TERRALL: Where?  
MOLLIE: I was walking past the big fireplace in the hall, sir, and her voice
sort of floated out of it.  
TERRALL: Will you explain how you could possibly hear Miss Waterfield's voice
when she's in Paris?  
MOLLIE: I know it can't be, sir, but I heard her as plain as anything.  
TERRALL: Anyway, what were you doing in the hall?  
MOLLIE: Oh, well. I wasn't doing anything wrong, sir.  
TERRALL: What were you doing in this part of the house at this hour?  
MOLLIE: Oh, I don't know.  
TERRALL: You do know, and you'll tell me!  
(Ruth is in the doorway.)  
RUTH: Arthur!  
TERRALL: I found this child creeping about the corridors.  
MOLLIE: I haven't done anything.  
TERRALL: Be quiet!  
MOLLIE: Yes, sir.  
TERRALL: She is miles from her room. Should have been in bed an hour since.  
RUTH: Did you have extra work, Mollie?  
MOLLIE: Yes, Miss Ruth. I did.  
TERRALL: You're a liar!  
MOLLIE: Well, I haven't done anything, Miss. I haven't took nothing.  
RUTH: Arthur, the poor child's frightened out of her senses.  
TERRALL: It's nothing but play acting. She's a mean, snivelling little minx.  
MOLLIE: But I haven't done anything, miss.  
TERRALL: Go to the sitting room and wait there. Mister Maxtible will decide
what to do with you.  
MOLLIE: But sir, I  
TERRALL: Do as you are told!  
RUTH: Mollie, it's all right. Everything will be all right.  
(Mollie leaves.)  
RUTH: Arthur, tell me what's wrong.  
TERRALL: Wrong? Why should something be wrong?  
RUTH: Has my father influenced you in some way?  
TERRALL: No, not your father.  
RUTH: Come away with me, please. I somehow feel if we delay, it'll be too
late.  
TERRALL: I can't go. Not yet.

**[Maxtible's laboratory]**

MAXTIBLE: I have done everything you have asked me to. You wanted an agency
here on Earth to plan and prepare things for you. I have been that agency.
Will you please tell those who give you orders that I am getting tired of
waiting.  
DALEK: Do you threaten the Daleks?  
MAXTIBLE: Oh, surely threatening is not necessary. We have a partnership, an
understanding.  
DALEK: You have obeyed us.  
MAXTIBLE: You have a strange way of putting things. I prefer to say that you
have asked for certain services, I have provided those services punctually and
efficiently. Now you really must look to your side of the bargain. It is not
beyond me to ruin the entire enterprise.  
(The Dalek knocks Maxtible down.)  
DALEK: Do not threaten! Obey!  
MAXTIBLE: Yes. Very well, I understand.  
DALEK: Obey the Daleks.  
MAXTIBLE: No, please. Please wait! The secret. The secret. You promised to
give it to me. That is why I have done all this.  
DALEK: The Daleks know many secrets. You will learn the most important.  
(The Dalek goes into the mirrored room.)  
MAXTIBLE: I must not be frightened of them. It's just their way. They're
different people. Alien. But they will tell me. Of course they will!  
RUTH: Father?  
MAXTIBLE: Ruth, I told you not to come in here.  
RUTH: I had to.  
MAXTIBLE: Under any circumstances.  
RUTH: Father, I simply had to. I heard you speaking to someone and there's no-
one here. And Arthur is involved in some way.  
MAXTIBLE: Ah, Arthur. Yes.  
RUTH: Why has he become so changed? And Victoria Waterfield. Where is she?  
MAXTIBLE: My child, these are questions that I cannot answer. But, my dear, I
will tell you one thing. One thing only, and then perhaps you may understand
why there are secrets to be kept. You see this?  
RUTH: What is it?  
MAXTIBLE: A piece of ordinary metal. Of very little value, would you not say
so?  
RUTH: I suppose so.  
MAXTIBLE: What does it weigh? A few pounds? Five, six, shall we say? For
centuries now, men have searched for the greatest secret of all. Some say it
was known to the ancient alchemists, some say that the secret never existed at
all, but still the stories and the rumours, and the search goes on.  
RUTH: What secret?  
MAXTIBLE: The transmutation of metal into gold. Changing metal into gold. Now,
perhaps, do you begin to understand a little? To possess such a secret would
mean power and influence beyond all imagination. And I am about to discover
this secret. Nothing will stop me. Nothing! Nobody!

**[Banqueting hall]**

(Victoria comes out onto the gallery again.)  
DALEK: Name?  
VICTORIA: Victoria.  
DALEK: Louder!  
VICTORIA: Victoria Waterfield! Victoria Waterfield!  
DALEK: Inspection is over. Return to your room.  
(Victoria leaves. Jamie and Kemel hold the rope between them and move forward.
Kemel throws the mace into the far corner to distract the Dalek, then they run
forward, using the rope to catapult it into the blazing fireplace.)  
JAMIE: Well, that's fixed that one.  
(Jamie and Kemel loop the rope over the railing of the gallery. Kemel holds
the ends as Jamie climbs up.)

**[Minstrel's gallery]**

(Jamie ties off the rope and Kemel starts to climb. The wood begins to creak.)  
JAMIE: Look out, the rail's going to break.  
(Jamie grabs Kemel's hand and helps him to safely just before the railing
breaks. Jamie taps on the door.)  
JAMIE: Miss Waterfield? Can you open the door? We've come to get you.  
(Below them, a Dalek enters the banqueting hall. Then the door opens,
revealing a second Dalek.)

__**Episode Five**__

**[Minstrel's gallery]**

(Jamie and Kemel lasso the Dalek with the rope and catapult it through the
broken railing. It crashes on the floor below and explodes.)  
JAMIE: Quick, before we see any more of those mechanical beasties.

**[Lumber room]**

VICTORIA: Kemel, my dear friend.  
JAMIE: Aye, he's a good friend, right enough, Miss Waterfield.  
VICTORIA: And you?  
JAMIE: Introductions in a moment, if you please. First, I'd like to make us a
little bit more secure. Kemel, if we lash this bedstead across the door, it
might just hold. Rope! That's it. We could do with a chest against it, I'm
thinking. Another one on top, ay? Well now, they can't get in and we can't get
out. So, where does that put us? Oh. Jamie McCrimmon. I, er, I came to give
you this.  
(Jamie hands over the handkerchief.)  

**[Trophy room]**

(The Doctor pours himself a glass of wine.)  
DOCTOR: Are you sure you won't join me?  
TERRALL: No, I won't. I very rarely touch it.  
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Well, something else, perhaps?  
TERRALL: No. Thank you.  
DOCTOR: I know. Let me ring for some food. Now, do join me?  
TERRALL: No! You seem determined to involve me.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I do, don't I?  
TERRALL: This is a large house. I prefer my own company.  
DOCTOR: Oh, how very unsociable.  
TERRALL: Yes, possibly. No doubt you will enjoy your libation in one of the
other rooms.  
DOCTOR: Liba? Oh. No, thank you. I'm perfectly happy here, thank you. I'm
perfectly happy.  
(The Doctor inspects the glass cases around the walls.)  
DOCTOR: What an extraordinary collection, isn't it?  
(Terrall takes a sword from the wall.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so sorry. You didn't, you weren't in the mood for talking,
were you?  
TERRALL: Shouldn't you be helping Waterfield and Maxtible with their
experiment?  
DOCTOR: Yes, but I thought I'd have a little rest. I wanted to talk to you.  
TERRALL: About what, pray?  
DOCTOR: About you, Mister Terrall. You interest me. Do you know something?
Ever since I came to this house, I, why, this is Circassian, surely.  
TERRALL: Do I know what?  
DOCTOR: Circassian. Ever since I came to this house, I have never seen you eat
or drink anything. Now, that's curious, isn't it?  
TERRALL: I dine alone.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'd thought of that. But Waterfield has never seen you eat or
drink either.  
TERRALL: You seem to be a devotee of Edgar Allan Poe.  
DOCTOR: Oh, do I?  
TERRALL: However it isn't wise to make assumptions.  
(Terrall gestures at the Doctor with the sword.)  
TERRALL: Nor to meddle in affairs which are none of your business.  
DOCTOR: Touch�. Oh, look.  
(Terrall rests the sword on a sideboard as the Doctor holds out his metal cup
towards it.)  
DOCTOR: A perfectly ordinary sword, and yet it appears to be magnetic. And
see. Directly you let go it loses its magnetism. Now, if I didn't know better,
Mister Terrall, I'd say that you were full of some sort of electricity.  
WATERFIELD: Doctor? Excuse me. You're wanted.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Excuse me.  
TERRALL: Doctor. No doubt you're a keen student of human nature, but some
things are better left alone.  
DOCTOR: No, Mister Terrall, I am not a student of human nature. I am a
professor of a far wider academy, of which human nature is merely a part. All
forms of life interest me.  
WATERFIELD: I'm sorry to interrupt you Doctor, but it's something rather
urgent.  
(The Doctor follows Waterfield from the room. Terrall pours himself a glass of
wine, but before he can take a sip, he has another of his attacks.)  
VOICE [OC]: Obey, obey, obey!  
(Terrall falls to his knees, clutching his head in agony.)

**[Lumber room]**

JAMIE: And so the Doctor and I were brought to the house.  
VICTORIA: Why did you risk your life to try and rescue me?  
JAMIE: Would you like some more water?  
VICTORIA: You are too modest. It was a silly question.  
JAMIE: Tell me, how did they come to capture you in the first place?  
VICTORIA: I don't remember. And yet, I seem to remember in the back of my
mind, somebody, oh, I can't recall who it was, telling me to walk. And I
obeyed, blindly and without interest.  
JAMIE: Aye. You were drugged, maybe?  
VICTORIA: I simply don't know. The only thing I remember is waking up in a
bare room with one of those terrible, terrible things.  
JAMIE: Well, what do you remember before that, apart from this hazy
recollection?  
VICTORIA: I was reading in the sitting room, but I couldn't concentrate
because I was so worried about Papa. I think I fell asleep over my book.  
JAMIE: You see, how you came under the power of the Daleks is very important.
They can't have done as much as they have without some help.  
VICTORIA: Help? From somebody in the house?  
JAMIE: Yes, from someone who wants their plans to succeed. Someone who drugged
you or found a way of putting you under the power of the Daleks.  
VICTORIA: But how? How could it be done without my knowing?

**[Trophy room]**

(Maxtible is sitting in a wing chair, with Mollie standing in front of him
staring vacantly ahead. Terrall is watching from across the room as Maxtible
swings a jewelled fob watch in front of Mollie.)  
MAXTIBLE: You are paying attention, Mollie?  
MOLLIE: Yes, sir.  
MAXTIBLE: Then keep your eyes fixed on the jewel. See how the light catches
it? Every facet sparkles, does it not?  
MOLLIE: Yes, sir.  
MAXTIBLE: Flashing, flashing, like a collection of sparks. But I know you are
tired, Mollie. You are tired, are you not? Tell me.  
MOLLIE: I am tired.  
MAXTIBLE: Then close your eyes and sleep. You need have no fear, my child. A
deep, heavy sleep. Oh, you are so exhausted. And now, in your sleep, you will
hear only my voice.  
MOLLIE: Only your voice.  
MAXTIBLE: You have been dreaming, Mollie. Dreaming that there are mysteries in
this house, that all is not well. You have dreamt that you heard the voice of
Miss Waterfield. But it was all your imagination. It was nothing but a dream.
Do you understand?  
MOLLIE: Nothing but a dream.  
MAXTIBLE: That is correct. Now, when I tell you to open your eyes, you will go
back to your room and lie down on your bed. And when you awaken, the dream
will fade and you will forget all your suspicions, for they might be injurious
to your health. Now, open your eyes.  
(Mollie leaves.)  
TERRALL: An excellent subject. I'd no idea that mesmerism was one of your
accomplishments.  
MAXTIBLE: How else do you suppose that I persuaded Victoria to go to the
Daleks?  
TERRALL: I see. What of the experiment?  
MAXTIBLE: It progresses.  
TERRALL: Are you sure of the Doctor?  
MAXTIBLE: No, but he is watched.  
TERRALL: And Waterfield?  
MAXTIBLE: Waterfield's usefulness is nearing it's end. Your intervention in
the stables was untimely.  
TERRALL: Maxtible, help me!  
MAXTIBLE: What do you mean?  
TERRALL: I seem to be in the grip of something. Sometimes my thoughts are
clear, sometimes muddled. I don't know what's happened. Help me.  
MAXTIBLE: I can only help you if you obey me.  
TERRALL: But I obey our masters.  
MAXTIBLE: I prefer to call them our colleagues. It is their wish that you
should obey me.  
TERRALL: You? But you would have killed Waterfield if they hadn't made me stop
you.  
MAXTIBLE: A slight misunderstanding on the part of our friends. But now it is
your turn to obey. I have a task for you to perform.  
(Maxtible touches a hidden switch and a panel opens in the wall, revealing a
secret passageway.)  
MAXTIBLE: This entrance leads to the south wing of my house and to a certain
room. You will fetch Victoria Waterfield and bring her to me.  
TERRALL: But, Maxtible.  
MAXTIBLE: Do as you are told!  
VOICE [OC]: Obey! Obey! Obey!  
MAXTIBLE: Well?  
TERRALL: I will bring Victoria to you.

**[Maxtible's laboratory]**

WATERFIELD: Is it finished?  
DOCTOR: Very nearly. Jamie was magnificent. But then I knew he would be. He
produced a whole battery of emotions, each one of which is imprinted in here,
see?  
(The Doctor holds up one of three glass capsules full of fine wiring.)  
WATERFIELD: The human factor?  
DOCTOR: Well, a part of it at least. The better part. Courage, pity, chivalry,
friendship, even compassion. Some of the virtues.  
WATERFIELD: In there?  
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a positronic brain. We're going to implant one of these into
each of these three Daleks here. The dormant ones.  
WATERFIELD: So the end is in sight?  
DOCTOR: Perhaps.  
WATERFIELD: What happens when the capsule comes into contact with the brain of
the Dalek and starts to influence it?  
DOCTOR: Perhaps it'll drive them insane.  
WATERFIELD: Or turn them into super-beings?  
DOCTOR: Well, that is their purpose. At least, I imagine it is. I can't help
feeling that there's more in this than meets the eye.  
DALEK: You have completed the experiment?  
DOCTOR: Yes, the three capsules are nearly ready.  
DALEK: Stand in front of the cabinet and speak when you have finished.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. I understand.  
DALEK: Doctor, be careful.  
(The Dalek goes back into the mirrored room.)  
WATERFIELD: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
WATERFIELD: You can't. You mustn't do it.  
DOCTOR: What do you mean?  
WATERFIELD: You must stop the experiment.  
DOCTOR: Oh, you should have thought of that some time ago.  
WATERFIELD: I know.  
DOCTOR: It's no use having a conscience now.  
WATERFIELD: But before it's too late.  
DOCTOR: It was too late when they took away your daughter. It was too late
when you stole my Tardus and lured me to this house and this century.  
WATERFIELD: Yes, but what are we doing? What are we really doing? Turning
these creatures into super-beings.  
DOCTOR: Homo superiense.  
WATERFIELD: Adding all that is best and finest in human nature to all that is
brilliant and superior in them. They'll be unbeatable.  
DOCTOR: That is their purpose.  
WATERFIELD: But you're making over the whole world to them. Don't you realise
that? Our world, our future. They will enslave us for all time.  
DOCTOR: That, Mister Waterfield, remains to be seen.  
(The Doctor turns back to his work. Waterfield sees the metal bar that Kemel
bent and picks it up. The Doctor grabs his arm before he can strike.)  
DOCTOR: Attacking me will do no good. Now listen. You've done all of this
because of your daughter. Jamie is with her now and they're both still in the
power of the Daleks. They must be set free!  
WATERFIELD: And sacrifice a whole world. A history, past, present and future?
Destroy an entire race?  
DOCTOR: Yes. I don't think you quite realise what you're saying. But yes, it
may come to that. It may very well come to that.

**[Lumber room]**

JAMIE: So, with the Dalek's eye stick pointing forward, Kemel and I were able
to tiptoe up behind him, throw the rope over his head and throw him into the
fire.  
(Kemel gestures at the packing cases barricading the door. Liquid is coming in
underneath them.)  
VICTORIA: What are they doing?  
JAMIE: They must be trying to get through. You'd better stand back, Miss
Waterfield.  
VICTORIA: Why not break the door down? They're strong enough.  
JAMIE: I don't know. Maybe they want us alive. I just don't know. Is it hot?
Aye, well, there's no smoke. It could be one of their newfangled inventions
trying to melt their way through. Look, you'd better stand right back. Why
didn't they try before this, is what I don't understand. Anyway, we'll make it
as hard for them as we possibly can. Come on, Kemel. Excuse me. Take this.
That's it. That one too.  
(The men pile more boxes around the door. A panel in the wall slides open
behind Victoria and Terrall enters.)  
JAMIE: What's puzzling me is, there were two on the way up here, and there was
a Dalek up here. And you were up  
(Terrall pulls Victoria into the secret passage and the door closes.)  
JAMIE: Hey, Miss Waterfield!  
VICTORIA [OC]: Jamie!  
JAMIE: Hey, did you hear it? Of course! Why didn't I use my head? There's
another way in and out of here. Come on!  
(Jamie searches for the opening switch as the barricade begins to crumble.
They open the panel and escape just before the Daleks break in.)

**[Secret passage]**

(At the trophy room door, Victoria frees herself while Terrall tries to open
it. Meanwhile, further back along the passage.)  
JAMIE: Oh, no. Two ways to go. Kemel, you go that way. If it's a dead end,
follow me.  
(Terrall hears someone approaching, and goes into the trophy room. Jamie sees
a slip of light coming from under the door. He searches for the switch.)

**[Trophy room]**

(Jamie pauses to get used to the bright light again. Terrall attacks him with
a sword, and misses. Jamie dodges his blade and gets his own sword from the
far wall. They fence, and are evenly matched. Jamie finally corners Terrall.)  
JAMIE: Right. Where's Victoria Waterfield?  
TERRALL: You'll never find her.  
JAMIE: Tell me!  
TERRALL Never!  
(Jamie continues the fight. Ruth and Mollie appear in the doorway.)  
RUTH: Mollie, go and fetch the Doctor. Quick, hurry!  
MOLLIE: Yes, mistress.  
RUTH: Arthur! Stop it. I implore you. Stop it.  
TERRALL: Leave me!  
RUTH: Please, I implore you. Stop it!  
(Terrall suddenly drops his sword and falls to his knees, clutching his head
in agony.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie, what have you done?  
JAMIE: But I can't understand it. He just collapsed.  
RUTH: Arthur, are you all right? What's happened to him?  
DOCTOR: Do you want to save this man's life?  
RUTH: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: Do you?  
RUTH: Yes!  
DOCTOR: Then take him away from here. As far away as possible. Go and get the
carriage round to the stables. You go too, Mollie. We'll bring him out you.
Now go along.  
RUTH: But, Doctor Oh, Mollie.  
(The Doctor finds a slim black box inside Terrall's jacket.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought he was under some sort of control. Come along.  
TERRALL: The creatures.  
DOCTOR: Yes, don't worry about them.  
TERRALL: There's danger, I tell you. Some kind of danger.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know there's danger. You must leave here immediately.  
TERRALL: The house, the creatures abroad.  
DOCTOR: Now you leave them to us. Take Ruth Maxtible with you. She's waiting
for you at the stables.  
TERRALL: Yes, very well.  
JAMIE: Can you manage?  
TERRALL: Yes, I think so. Wait. There's something at the back of my mind.
Victoria Waterfield. I feel I've harmed her in some way.  
DOCTOR: Victoria is safe and well.  
TERRALL: You You're positive?  
DOCTOR: I'm positive. Now we'll take care of her. You must leave immediately.  
TERRALL: Yes, if that's what you want. I'll find Ruth by the stables?  
DOCTOR: Yes!  
TERRALL: Yes.  
(Terrall leaves.)  
JAMIE: Well, that's fine for Ruth Maxtible, but you lied about Victoria.  
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, and we must turn that lie into a truth.

**[Maxtible's laboratory]**

(Kemel's passageway brings him out at the top of the spiral stairs that lead
down to the laboratory. Victoria is lying unconscious in front of the mirror
room. Kemel kneels next to her.)  
DALEK: Turn around. Pick up the human female. Obey. Obey! Hurry! Hurry! Move
into the cabinet. Obey! Move!  
(Kemel carries Victoria inside and the Dalek follows. After a while, the
Doctor, Jamie and Waterfield enter.)  
DOCTOR: Well, Jamie, the experiment's nearly over. I've had no sleep. I've
been up all night, but it's been worth it.  
JAMIE: Och, don't touch me!  
DOCTOR: Oh, now what's the matter?  
JAMIE: Anyone would think this was a little game.  
DOCTOR: No it is not a game.  
JAMIE: Of course it isn't, Doctor. People have died. The Daleks are all over
the place, fit to murder the lot of us, and all you can say is you've had a
good night's work.  
DOCTOR: Jamie.  
JAMIE: No, Doctor. Look, I'm telling you this. You and me, we're finished.
You're just too callous for me. Anything goes by the board. Anything at all.  
DOCTOR: That's just not true, Jamie. I've never held that the end justifies
the means.  
JAMIE: Och, words. What do I care about words? You don't give that much for a
living soul except yourself.  
DOCTOR: I care about life. I care about human beings. Do you think I let you
go through that Dalek test lightly?  
JAMIE: I don't know. Did you? Look, Doctor, just whose side are you on?  
(Three Daleks come from the packing cases.)  
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie. They're friends.  
JAMIE: Friends?  
DOCTOR: Now don't get the wrong idea. They are the experiment.  
(The Daleks gather round a swivel chair and play at pushing it. Maxtible
enters and likes what he sees.)  
MAXTIBLE: Every feeling, every thought impulse you had during your attempt to
rescue Victoria Waterfield, was recorded and made into a small positronic
brain and added to these Daleks. The human factor to add to their own powers,
to triumph over human beings.  
JAMIE: Well, how do you know they haven't succeeded?  
DOCTOR: Because human beings, Jamie, no matter how brilliant they may be, are
always within reach of other human beings. Now then, it's all right, Jamie,
don't worry.  
JAMIE: How do you know you can trust them, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: What is it?  
(The Daleks close in on the Doctor, pushing him towards the chair. He sits.)  
DOCTOR: What do you want? Hmm? What are you up to? Ah! What are you doing?  
JAMIE: Doctor, where are they taking you?  
DOCTOR: Where are you taking me?  
(The Daleks push the chair around the room.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie, they're taking me for a ride! Jamie, they're playing a game.
It's a game! They're taking me for a ride!  
MAXTIBLE: A rather amusing little game, don't you think, Jamie?

__**Episode Six**__

**[Maxtible's laboratory]**

DOCTOR: We've done it! Maxtible, they've got the human factor. We've done it!
What are they doing now? Look, they're all joining in. They're playing train!  
(The Doctor blows on his recorder.)  
DALEKS: Trains, trains, trains, trains.  
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh, now what is it? Oh, we're on a roundabout. They're playing
roundabout. Oh, I'm getting dizzy. Oh, dear. Oh, I'm dizzy! Oh, I'm dizzy.  
DALEKS: Diz-zy, diz-zy, dizzy, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Maxtible, do you hear that? They've got a sense of humour.  
MAXTIBLE: I'm glad you are so easily amused.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
MAXTIBLE: Well, I congratulate you, Doctor. They are almost human.  
DOCTOR: They are.  
MAXTIBLE: And I will now leave you to your little games.  
(Maxtible leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.  
JAMIE: Well, how old are they now, Doctor, mentally?  
DOCTOR: Oh, they're just young children, but they'll grow up very fast. Within
a matter of hours. Now, come here, all of you. Come along, gather round. Come
here. Now then, come along, come along.  
DALEK: Who is this?  
DOCTOR: Oh, this is Jamie. He's a friend.  
DALEK: Friend. Hello, friend.  
DOCTOR: Well say hello, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Hello.  
DOCTOR: You know what a friend is, don't you? It's somebody who likes you, who
wants to help you and share with you.  
(The Doctor has been scratching a greek letter on the base of each Dalek.)  
DOCTOR: There we are.  
DALEK: What have you done?  
DOCTOR: I have given you all names. Alpha, Beta and Omega.  
OMEGA: Alpha.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
ALPHA: Beta.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
BETA: Omega.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
OMEGA: Alpha.  
ALPHA: Beta.  
BETA: Omega.  
OMEGA: Alpha.  
ALPHA: Beta.  
BETA: Omega.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes. Now, this is Jamie and I am Doctor. We are friends.  
OMEGA: Friends, friends.  
ALPHA: Jamie, Doctor.  
DALEKS: Friends, friends.  
OMEGA: We must go now. We are called.  
DOCTOR: Go? Called? Go where? What do you mean, go?  
OMEGA: All Daleks are ordered to return to Skaro.  
DOCTOR: Return to Skaro? But that's the Dalek plan.  
OMEGA: Friend.  
JAMIE: But if the Daleks are returning to Skaro, where's Victoria?  
DOCTOR: Victoria! We left her in the secret passage. Come along, follow me!
(The Doctor and Jamie run up the spiral staircase. Maxtible and Waterfield
enter.)  
MAXTIBLE: I assure you, my dear Waterfield, Victoria is perfectly safe.  
WATERFIELD: But where is she?  
MAXTIBLE: The Daleks have released her.  
WATERFIELD: Released her?  
MAXTIBLE: Yes, yes, yes, yes.  
WATERFIELD: Well then, where is she now?  
MAXTIBLE: She's probably lying down. Ruth will be taking care of her, you may
be sure of that.  
WATERFIELD: Not Ruth, no. I saw her and Mollie helping Arthur Terrall into a
dog-cart not half an hour since.  
MAXTIBLE: Ruth and Terrall?  
WATERFIELD: Yes. Surely you knew they were leaving?  
MAXTIBLE: Oh, yes, yes, indeed, yes. It slipped my memory. You see, I'm going
for a little trip myself. No doubt, I shall join them. Well, possibly she's
taking a stroll in the garden. Go along and see. Go along and see.  
WATERFIELD: Yes.  
MAXTIBLE: Well, go along, man! Go along and see. Find your Victoria.  
(Waterfield leaves.)  
MAXTIBLE: Stupid, stupid girl.  
(Maxtible takes a travelling bag from a cupboard. He notices a small grey box
on the floor. It is fastened down securely, so he open it to see a complicated
mechanism.)  
DALEK: What are you doing?  
MAXTIBLE: Merely looking.  
DALEK: Do not touch the instrument.  
MAXTIBLE: What is that box for?  
DALEK: Do not question. You have your orders.  
MAXTIBLE: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. To bring the Doctor and his companion to you
here for our little trip.  
DALEK: Yes.  
MAXTIBLE: And then the secret. You will give it to me?  
DALEK: Yes.  
MAXTIBLE: The formula. The transmutation formula.  
DALEK: Yes. Obey your order. Do not delay.  
(The Dalek leaves. Waterfield watches Maxtible from the doorway as he returns
to the box on the floor. It seems to contain a timing device.)  
MAXTIBLE: Doctor? Doctor? Doctor? Oh, Waterfield, how I'm delighted you've
come back. Now will you please go and find the Doctor and his companion Jamie,
and bring them here to me. It is a matter of some urgency.  
WATERFIELD: Maxtible?  
MAXTIBLE: Oh, what is it?  
WATERFIELD: What have you arranged with the Daleks?  
MAXTIBLE: The Daleks? Nothing.  
WATERFIELD: What formula did they promise you?  
MAXTIBLE: No formula whatever.  
WATERFIELD: What are you doing? You've sold yourself to them, haven't you?  
MAXTIBLE: You fool!  
WATERFIELD: Yes, I'm a fool. A fool not to have realised before that it was
you who brought all this misery down on us.  
MAXTIBLE: You never did understand anything, did you? Well, metal into gold.
That's what the Daleks are going to give me. Now do you begin to understand?
The secret of the transmutation of metal into gold.  
WATERFIELD: Do you imagine I care about that? Where's Victoria?  
MAXTIBLE: I have not the remotest idea.  
WATERFIELD: Yes, you have, and you're going to tell me! Where is my daughter?  
MAXTIBLE: Get your hands off me. Let go of me! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder!
Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Oh.  
(Maxtible smashes a rack of test tubes against Waterfield's head, knocking him
down. A Dalek comes out of the mirror room and adjusts the control in the grey
box.)  
MAXTIBLE: Oh, what are you doing?  
DALEK: Where is the Doctor?  
MAXTIBLE: Well, I had no time to bring him.  
DALEK: Hurry. That is an order.  
MAXTIBLE: What is that box for? Will you tell me?  
DALEK: We are destroying this area.  
MAXTIBLE: But you can't do that. Turn it off! You cannot destroy my house!  
DALEK: Bring the Doctor. Obey! Immediately!  
MAXTIBLE: But, the secret. If you destroy my laboratory, the secret is
useless. You promised me. They must be out of their minds. Destroy my
laboratory? The very idea. Well, well, but, oh goodness gracious me, only two
minutes. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Oh, you fool.
Doctor! Doctor!  
(Maxtible grabs his bag and runs into the mirror room. Waterfield sits up.
Other Daleks return from the rest of the house.)  
DALEK: All Daleks return to Skaro.  
DALEK 2: All Daleks return to Skaro.  
DALEK: And the prisoners?  
DALEK 2: They are already in transit.  
(The Daleks go into the mirror room. Waterfield stands as Jamie and the Doctor
enter.)  
WATERFIELD: Dalek. Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Waterfield, what's happened to you?  
WATERFIELD: Doctor. Daleks going to destroy house. Can't turn it off.  
DOCTOR: But this is a time switch.  
JAMIE: Well, if you can't turn it off, surely  
DOCTOR: No, wait a minute. Eighty nine, eighty eight, eighty seven. Just about
a minute, that's all we've got.  
JAMIE: Well, toss it out the window then.  
DOCTOR: This isn't a firework. We'd have to toss this half a mile. We'll have
to follow the Daleks to Skaro. Jamie, open the doors. Come along.  
WATERFIELD: Doctor, Doctor.  
JAMIE: Doctor, they're locked. They won't budge!  
WATERFIELD: Cupboard in the alcove. The time machine.  
DOCTOR: Time machine? Jamie, give me a hand. Quickly.  
(The Doctor and Jamie go to the cupboard and pull out the two sections of the
transmat from the antique shop.)  
DOCTOR: Now the other one. Steady.  
(They set them up and the Doctor tries to set the controls.) JAMIE: Right.
Now, where's Victoria?  
DOCTOR: Quick, Jamie, the time switch.  
JAMIE: Twenty eight, Doctor. Hey, Doctor, Kemel must have dropped this.  
DOCTOR: Jamie!  
(It's the pressed flower.)  
JAMIE: We'll find Victoria, and Kemel too.  
(The Doctor and Jamie help Waterfield to the time machine and they fade away
as the countdown hits zero. KaBOOM!)

**[Skaro cell]**

(Victoria is imprisoned again, in a plain cell with Kemel.)  
VICTORIA: Dear Kemel. Are any of the others here?  
(Kemel shakes his head.)  
VICTORIA: The Daleks?  
(Kemel nods. A Dalek enters with Maxtible.)  
DALEK: You will wait here.  
VICTORIA: Oh, Mister Maxtible.  
MAXTIBLE: What are you doing here?  
VICTORIA: Don't know. Nor even where here may be.  
MAXTIBLE: Oh, we've been transported to the Dalek planet, my dear. To Skaro.  
VICTORIA: I don't understand you.  
MAXTIBLE: A little journey through space.  
VICTORIA: They're taken us somewhere. Is that what you mean? Away from your
house?  
MAXTIBLE: Oh, far away. Far, far away.  
VICTORIA: But why? What do they want?  
MAXTIBLE: I know why I am here. But why you are here I have not the faintest
idea.  
VICTORIA: You seem to understand them. Ask them.  
MAXTIBLE: Don't be foolish girl. I shall do no such thing.  
VICTORIA: And where's my father?  
MAXTIBLE: I do not know. I am not a nursemaid to your father.  
DALEK: Follow me.  
MAXTIBLE: Of course, I shall do my best for you, but the matter is really
entirely out of my hands.  
(Maxtible leaves.)  
VICTORIA: It's no good. He won't help us. Don't worry, Kemel. I shall protect
you. I shall see they do you no harm. Yes, I suppose it was a bit silly.
(Kemel shakes his head and flexes his muscles.)  
VICTORIA: You think so? I wish I did. Oh well, maybe between us we can fight
them. We must face it out together.

**[Skaro desert]**

(The Doctor, Jamie and Waterfield are sheltering in a rocky outcrop.)  
WATERFIELD: And that is the Dalek city?  
DOCTOR: Yes, it is.  
JAMIE: I've scouted around, but I can't see any water.  
WATERFIELD: Oh, please don't bother. I feel much better.  
DOCTOR: Are you sure?  
WATERFIELD: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Come along, then. We must get along.  
JAMIE: You mean just walk into the city?  
DOCTOR: Oh, no. The city is all around us. At least, it's beneath us. Come
along.  
(The Doctor takes them to a tunnel mouth in the rock face.)  
JAMIE: How long have you known that's there?  
DOCTOR: Not a sound. I think the Daleks are in for a little surprise.

**[Skaro corridor]**

BLACK: Where is the Doctor?  
MAXTIBLE: I had no time to get him.  
BLACK: No time?  
MAXTIBLE: I was told my house was going to be destroyed. Why?  
BLACK: You did not bring the Doctor?  
MAXTIBLE: Everything I possess is in that house. Everything. What right had
you or anyone to destroy it?  
BLACK: Right?  
MAXTIBLE: All these years of labour, all these years of research, destroyed
through this caprice of yours. My laboratory, the only real thing in the whole
of my existence, destroyed. I, Theodore Maxtible, made a bargain with you, and
I demand to know. Ah! ah!  
BLACK: You have disobeyed a Dalek command. You must obey the Dalek command.  
DALEKS: Exterminate. Destroy.  
MAXTIBLE: It's not my fault. I swear it's not my fault. I No!  
(An alarm sounds. The Black Dalek leaves.)  
DALEK 2: Move.  
MAXTIBLE: What is happening? What are you going to do with me?  
DALEK 2: Obey. Move.

**[Skaro cell]**

(A grey then a black Dalek enter.)  
GREY: These humans are still here.  
BLACK: Then other humans are inside the city. (The Daleks leave.)  
VICTORIA: Other humans inside the city, Kemel. Listen!  
DALEK [OC]: Emergency. Emergency. Human beings detected in city. Emergency!
Emergency!  
VICTORIA: Maybe it's Jamie and the Doctor. Oh, Kemel, there's a chance. A
chance.  
DALEK [OC]: Intruders detected. Emergency! Emergency! Human beings detected in
city. Emergency! Emergency! Intruders detected. All Daleks to observation
stations. Repeat. All Daleks to observation stations. Emergency!  
(The humans come out of a tunnel into a huge canyon. They have to sidle along
a narrow ledge.)

**[Skaro corridor]**

BLACK: Stop! What is that mark?  
OMEGA: That is my name.  
BLACK: Name?  
OMEGA: The Doctor gave it to me.  
DALEK: Doctor?  
OMEGA: Yes. He is my friend.  
DALEK: Follow me.  
(The two Daleks move on, and shortly afterwards Kemel and Victoria are
escorted along.)

**[outside the Control room]**

(The control room is in darkness.)  
DALEK: Remain here.  
MAXTIBLE: What is happening? Do you know? They say there are other human
beings in the city.  
VICTORIA: No. No, thank you. Why don't you answer me. You little fool!  
(Maxtible lunges at Victoria and Kemel intervenes.)  
MAXTIBLE: No one can help you here. No one but me.  
DALEK: Silence. Follow me. You, wait.  
MAXTIBLE: I can't see anything.  
DALEK: Move!  
MAXTIBLE: Where are you taking me?  
(The Dalek takes Maxtible into the dark room. Maxtible screams.)  
VICTORIA: Oh, what are they doing to him?  
DALEK: You follow. You will wait.  
VICTORIA: I will do as you say.  
DALEK: Move forward. Alone.

**[Underground tunnel]**

(Below the control room somewhere.)  
JAMIE: That was a human voice, I tell you.  
DOCTOR: Perhaps it was, Jamie.  
WATERFIELD: We must go more quickly.  
(Victoria screams.)  
JAMIE: Victoria!  
DOCTOR: No, you mustn't.  
JAMIE: That was Victoria's voice.  
DOCTOR: You can't. You'll go over the edge!  
DALEK: Doctor, I am your friend.  
JAMIE: One of your experiments, Doctor. For a moment I thought we were done
for.  
DOCTOR: What is your name?  
DALEK: Omega.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I see.  
DALEK: I have come to lead you.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
(The Doctor slips on the ledge.)  
JAMIE: Careful!  
(The Doctor sees the mark on the Dalek, and gets up.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm all right, thank you. Lead on.  
DALEK: Follow me.  
(The Doctor dodges ahead of the Dalek.)  
DOCTOR: What was that screaming?  
DALEK: A prisoner.  
DOCTOR: Where?  
DALEK: Follow me. I will show you.  
(The Doctor flattens himself against the rock so the Dalek can pass.)  
JAMIE: What are you doing?  
(The Doctor pushes the Dalek off the ledge into the chasm.)  
DOCTOR: Think I don't know my own mark? That wasn't the real Omega at all.  
JAMIE: Up to all sorts of tricks, aren't they?  
WATERFIELD: Oh, please. We must reach my daughter.

**[Skaro cell]**

MAXTIBLE: I tell you, they forced me. They threatened to kill us all. First of
all, they ordered me to scream and I was to make you do the same.  
VICTORIA: And you had to do as you were told?  
MAXTIBLE: I tell you, they threatened to kill me.  
VICTORIA: You came up behind me in the dark and twisted my arm.  
MAXTIBLE: And what else could I do?  
VICTORIA: Oh, if only I'd realised. Why do you think they wanted us to scream
like that?  
MAXTIBLE: I've no idea.  
VICTORIA: You know perfectly well. There are other people in the city. They
wanted to draw them on, trap them. Oh, if only I could have thought quickly.
Oh, Kemel.  
(The intruders climb out of a ventilation grille and walk along the corridor.
A Dalek watches them go.)

**[Outside the control room]**

DOCTOR: No. No, I don't like the look of this. Back the way we came.  
(Two Daleks block their way.)  
BLACK: Follow me.

**[Control room]**

(They follow the Black into the control room which gradually lights up. A big
Dalek is seated on a dais and connected to its surrounding by lots of tubes.)  
EMPEROR: Doctor!  
JAMIE: Look at the size of that thing.  
EMPEROR: So, you are the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: We meet at last. I wondered if we ever would.  
EMPEROR: The experiment is over.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I have implanted the human factor in the three Daleks that you
gave me. When I say run, run!  
EMPEROR: Speak louder.  
DOCTOR: Promise me, Jamie. I was merely telling my friend that the day of the
Daleks is coming to an end.  
EMPEROR: Explain.  
DOCTOR: It's very simple. Somewhere in the Dalek race there are three Daleks
with the human factor. Gradually, they will come to question. They will
persuade other Daleks to question. You will have a rebellion on your planet!  
EMPEROR: No.  
DOCTOR: I say yes. I've beaten you and I don't care what you do to me now.  
EMPEROR: Silence. The human factor showed us what the Dalek factor was.  
DOCTOR: What?  
JAMIE: What does that mean?  
EMPEROR: Without knowing, you have shown the Daleks what their own strength
is.  
WATERFIELD: While you were doing one thing, they were really making you do
another.  
EMPEROR: The human factor is useless.  
DOCTOR: You still have those three Daleks to contend with.  
EMPEROR: They will be impregnated with the Dalek factor. Your discovery, but
your work is not over.  
DOCTOR: I won't work for you.  
EMPEROR: You will obey!  
JAMIE: What is the Dalek factor?  
DOCTOR: You want me to guess? It means to obey, to fight, to destroy, to
exterminate. I won't do it.  
EMPEROR: Watch!  
(An alcove lights up to reveal...)  
JAMIE: The Tardis, Doctor!  
EMPEROR: You will take the Dalek factor. You will spread it to the entire
history of Earth!

__**Episode Seven**__

**[Control room]**

DOCTOR: No. You can't make me do it. You can't.  
EMPEROR: You will obey!  
BLACK: Move!  
EMPEROR: Doctor, you will obey.

**[Weapons room]**

(A large glass container full of an opaque liquid is suspended over a second
empty container and linked to it by a mass of tubes and wires. There is a
digital display panel.)  
DALEK: Experiment ready.  
BLACK: Proceed.  
(The machine is switched on, and starts humming.)

**[Skaro cell]**

MAXTIBLE: Transmutation of metal into gold.  
JAMIE: You mean to say he's worked against us all just for that?  
DOCTOR: People have done worse for less, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Look, it's daft though. Metal into gold's an old wives tale.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. The alchemists of the Middle Ages made transmutation
their main aim in life.  
JAMIE: Ah, they didn't succeed though.  
DOCTOR: Even in the twentieth century, it's still considered scientifically
possible.  
MAXTIBLE: Of course it's possible.  
JAMIE: Oh, well, I don't care whether it's possible or not.  
DOCTOR: Whether it is or whether it isn't is beside the point.  
JAMIE: Oh, and what is the point then?  
DOCTOR: Why are the Daleks doing this?  
MAXTIBLE: They promised me!  
DOCTOR: Daleks don't keep their promises.  
MAXTIBLE: I see what you're trying to do, Doctor. You're trying to shake my
faith. But I will be given the secret.  
JAMIE: Ah, well it won't do you any good because you won't be able to use your
secret. I'll see to that.  
MAXTIBLE: You'll do no such thing!  
DOCTOR: Jamie!  
DALEK: Move away! Move!  
VICTORIA: Please, Jamie, do as it says.  
DALEK: You will not harm this human being or you will be exterminated.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. We quite understand.  
MAXTIBLE: You will be advised to do as they say.  
JAMIE: Oh, don't worry. The very thought of going near you revolts me.  
WATERFIELD: Mister McCrimmon.  
(The Dalek leaves. The Doctor plays his recorder.)  
WATERFIELD: They seem to be prepared to protect you.  
MAXTIBLE: Be warned.  
WATERFIELD: I appeal to you, Maxtible. It may still not be too late. If
they're your friends, help us. If you did, we could plan something. Try to
escape.  
MAXTIBLE: No!  
WATERFIELD: Well at least for Victoria's sake, after what you did to her.  
MAXTIBLE: No, I tell you! No!  
VICTORIA: It's no good, Papa. He doesn't listen any more. What are you
thinking?  
DOCTOR: I'm trying to puzzle out a problem, Victoria. The Daleks say I'm going
to do something for them. Something I would rather die than do.  
MAXTIBLE: Plus or minus point oh oh three. Plus or minus.  
VICTORIA: Perhaps they think you're like him.  
DOCTOR: Oh, no. The Daleks know me well enough by this time.  
VICTORIA: They intend to persuade you then.  
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, it isn't that either. You see, there isn't a persuasion
strong enough. Not even the offer of all the lives in this room.  
VICTORIA: I see.  
DOCTOR: Five lives against a whole planet? Well, it's not a choice, is it?  
VICTORIA: No.  
DOCTOR: Even if I could trust the Daleks, even if they set us free, we still
couldn't go back to Earth. I suppose I might try and take you all to another
universe. I might even try and take you to my own planet.  
VICTORIA: Your own?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I live a long, long way away from Earth. Oh, just a minute.
Maxtible! Arthur Terrall! The Daleks put some sort of control device on him.  
MAXTIBLE: What of it? It was erratic. I always warned the Daleks it would
prove unsatisfactory.  
JAMIE: Aye. Well, it's a good thing for you it did fail. They'd have tried it
on you next.

**[Control room]**

EMPEROR: Report!  
BLACK: The experiment is ready.  
EMPEROR: Proceed.

**[Weapons room]**

(Three Daleks are working on the equipment.)  
BLACK: Discontinue work. Discontinue work. Discontinue work.  
OMEGA: Why?  
BLACK DALEK: Who spoke? Who questioned a Dalek command?  
(The three Daleks line up by the machine.)

**[Skaro cell]**

BLACK: The secret of transmutated metal.  
MAXTIBLE: Yes. Yes, yes, the secret you promised me.  
BLACK: Turn and look.  
(A panel in the wall slides back to show the machine in the weapons room next
door.)  
BLACK DALEK: Above, liquid metal. Read.  
MAXTIBLE: Wait.  
BLACK DALEK: Do not move!  
MAXTIBLE: It is hard to see. Fifty five point eight four.  
BLACK: Atomic weight. Read again.  
MAXTIBLE: Seven point eight four.  
BLACK: Specific gravity.  
DOCTOR: Atomic weight and gravity of iron.  
BLACK: Watch. Read atomic weight.  
MAXTIBLE: Nineteen point two.  
BLACK: Read specific gravity.  
MAXTIBLE: Sixty nine point five. Gold! Iron into gold! I told you it was
possible. They've kept their promise. It's true, it's true! They have!  
BLACK: The machine is yours.  
MAXTIBLE: Yes. Ha, ha, ha. Yes, yes!  
DOCTOR: Maxtible, if you value your life, don't go near that machine!  
(Too late. Maxtible steps through the archway and is instantly paralysed.)  
JAMIE: Maxtible!  
(Lights play on his face.)  
VICTORIA: What have they done to him?  
BLACK: Turn. Move to control.  
MAXTIBLE: I obey.  
JAMIE: They've turned him into a Dalek.  
BLACK: Yes. The Dalek factor.  
DOCTOR: Is that what you want me to do to the people of Earth?  
BLACK: We know you will obey.  
(The Black Dalek leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Human beings into Daleks.

**[Control Room]**

BLACK: Emperor.  
EMPEROR: Speak!  
BLACK: A Dalek questioned an order.  
EMPEROR: Questioned? Then it was one of the test Daleks.  
BLACK: Yes.  
EMPEROR: Find it, immediately!

**[Skaro cell]**

(Nighttime, and Maxtible walks through the deserted weapons room. He adjusts a
scanner box so it faces the door to the cell, then activates the door so the
panel opens. Everyone is asleep. Maxtible goes to the Doctor and takes out his
fob watch and starts swinging it.)  
MAXTIBLE: Doctor, open your eyes. You are asleep still but you can hear my
voice. I have come to help you. Look at the box.  
(An image appears on the scanner.)  
MAXTIBLE: I have had your Tardis placed outside the city. I will take you to
it. Rise, and follow me.  
(The Doctor gets up and goes towards the doorway.)  
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, what are you doing? Don't go near the door, Doctor!  
(The Doctor steps into the doorway and stands still as the lights flash for a
few moments then stop.)  
JAMIE: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Stay where you are! That is an order!  
MAXTIBLE: We will work together on the Dalek factor. Follow me.  
DOCTOR: I obey.

**[Weapons room]**

(Maxtible and the Doctor walk to a large computer terminal.)  
MAXTIBLE: Stop. This machine is for the mass production of the Dalek factor.
Follow me.  
(Maxtible holds up a small glass capsule.)  
MAXTIBLE: Stop.  
(He gestures to a second machine.)  
MAXTIBLE: This machine will transform the thought patterns in this capsule
into a steam. The steam will be sprayed into the atmosphere of the Earth.  
DOCTOR: I must examine the machine.  
MAXTIBLE: Do so.  
(The DOCTOR bends over the equipment. Maxtible leaves the Doctor alone. Then
the Doctor sneaks back to the doorway to the cell and opens a small panel. It
contains a glass capsule which the Doctor removes and replaces with another
from his pockets. He puts back the panel and has a good look around before
going back to the closed door.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie. Jamie. Jamie!  
JAMIE: Yes?  
DOCTOR: Jamie, when I give you the word, bring everyone through this archway.
Through the door.  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: Trust me.  
BLACK: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Take me to your Emperor.  
BLACK: Wait.  
(The Black Dalek opens the doorway. The Doctor winks at Jamie, then the door
shuts again.)

**[Skaro cell]**

VICTORIA: He walked through, just as though he was  
WATERFIELD: It must have affected him. We saw it happen.  
JAMIE: But you heard him speak normally just now.  
WATERFIELD: Another trap to make us walk though?  
JAMIE: Oh, they could push us through any time they liked.  
VICTORIA: Do you think there's a chance? Something to hope for?  
JAMIE: I don't know. Well, I don't understand. I mean, how do we know we can
trust him?

**[Control room]**

EMPEROR: What do you want?  
DOCTOR: A Dalek questioned an order.  
EMPEROR: Again?  
MAXTIBLE: We have searched without success.  
DOCTOR: All Daleks must pass through the archway door. The Dalek with the
human factor will then become a Dalek again. Will become as this human and I
have become.  
EMPEROR: Let it be done!  
MAXTIBLE + DOCTOR: I obey.  
EMPEROR: You will deal with the human prisoners.

**[Skaro cell]**

(The door panel is opened and everyone watches a procession of Daleks pass
through the archway and get the flashing light treatment before entering the
weapons room.) DOCTOR: Go on, quickly. Through the door. Follow them through
the door! Oh, it's all right. I've changed over the factors. I used one of the
capsules from my test Dalek. I've given them all the human factor! Go on! Go
on!  
JAMIE: Well, aren't you coming?  
DOCTOR: Well, I've got things to do. And I've been through already.  
JAMIE: Ah, well, why didn't it affect you then?  
DOCTOR: I don't come from Earth, Jamie. Now, down the corridor, turn to the
left and find the tunnel. I'll join you there later.  
JAMIE: Oh well, here goes. It's all right, nothing happened! Come on! Come on,
Kemel. Quick!  
WATERFIELD: Victoria, I must help the Doctor.  
JAMIE: Oh, don't be a fool, man.  
VICTORIA: Father, no.  
WATERFIELD: I must find Maxtible. He's to blame for all this. Take care of
her.  
VICTORIA: But Father!  
JAMIE: Oh, he'll be all right, come on.

**[Weapons room]**

(A group of freshly humanised Daleks are twirling around and having fun as the
party sneaks past.) i  
DALEK: Oh, dizzy!  
DALEKS: Dizzy Daleks!  
DALEK: Dizzy, dizzy.  
DALEKS: Dizzy Daleks!  
(More Daleks come through the cell and get converted, then a Black Dalek
arrives with Maxtible.)

**[Skaro cell]**

MAXTIBLE: Where are the prisoners?  
DALEK: I do not know.  
BLACK: Continue working.  
DALEK: Why?  
DALEK 2: Yes, why?  
BLACK: Do not question.  
DALEKS: Why? Why? Why? Why not question? Why?  
BLACK: Silence! You will obey!  
DALEK: I will not obey.  
(The Black Dalek fires at the questioning Dalek, killing it.)  
BLACK: You will obey without question!  
(Two humanised Daleks fire at the Black, which bursts into flames.)

**[Weapons room]**

(The Doctor appears in the doorway.)  
DOCTOR: Quickly, this way. Follow me, Daleks! This way! Come on!

**[outside the Control room]**

BLACK: Return to your work.  
DALEK: Why?  
BLACK: Do not question.  
DOCTOR: Why not question? What work? Tell them.  
BLACK: Silence!  
DALEK: Explain.  
OMEGA: What work?  
DALEK: Why obey without question?  
DOCTOR: Ask the Emperor!  
OMEGA: The Emperor.  
DALEK: Yes, ask the Emperor.  
BLACK: Keep back, you cannot enter!  
DOCTOR: Why?  
DALEK: Why?  
OMEGA: Why?  
DALEK: The Emperor must explain.  
(The Black Dalek opens fire.)  
DOCTOR: Defend yourselves, Daleks! The Black Daleks are attacking you!

**[Control room}**

EMPEROR: All Black Dalek Leaders to Control. Exterminate all opposition!
Destroy rebels!

**[outside the Control room]**

DOCTOR: Come on! This way! Come on!  
DALEK: I will obey.  
OMEGA: But not without question.  
DOCTOR: That's right. Question!  
WATERFIELD: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: The Black Daleks are attacking every man.  
WATERFIELD: Hurry, man!  
DOCTOR: The Emperor has commanded it.  
DALEK: Why?  
OMEGA: Why?  
DOCTOR: Because you question. Defend yourselves. Destroy the Emperor or be
destroyed yourselves!  
WATERFIELD: Hurry.  
DOCTOR: Destroy the Emperor!  
WATERFIELD: We must go, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. I've finished now.  
(A Black Dalek appears. Waterfield pushes the Doctor aside and takes the full
weapon hit. The friendly Daleks take revenge.)  
DOCTOR: Now lie still. I'll try and get help to you.  
WATERFIELD: No time for help.  
DOCTOR: You saved my life, didn't you.  
WATERFIELD: Yes. Good life to save. Please, you must. Victoria.  
DOCTOR: Don't worry about Victoria. We'll look after her.  
WATERFIELD: No time for me.  
(Waterfield dies. More friendly Daleks arrive.)  
DOCTOR: The Emperor has commanded your destruction!  
DALEKS: Why? Why? Why?  
DOCTOR: But your friends are fighting for you!  
DALEKS: Friends?  
DOCTOR: Down there. Help them.  
DALEKS: Friends.

**[Control room]**

DALEK [OC]: Exterminate. Annihilate.  
EMPEROR: Danger! This is your Emperor speaking! There is danger here! Obey me!
Do not fight in here! Do not fight in here! I said, Obey! Obey!  
(The friendly Daleks break through the Black defence and rush in.)  
EMPEROR: Obey me! Obey me! Your Emperor is ordering you. You will not fight in
here! You will not fight in here! Obey! I am your Emperor! Daleks, obey me!
Obey! Obey! Obey! You will be exterminated! All exterminated. Annihilated! We
will all be exterminated! Annihilated!  
(But the civil war intensifies.)  
EMPEROR: The Dalek race will die out completely! Obey your Emperor! Obey!  
(The weapons room explodes.)

**[Underground tunnel]**

(Making their way along the narrow ledge.)  
MAXTIBLE: Kemel! Come here!  
(Maxtible throws himself at his former servant.)  
MAXTIBLE: Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!  
(The Dalek Maxtible is strong and starts to throttle Kemel before throwing him
down into the chasm.)

**[Control room]**

EMPEROR: Attention! Attention! Emergency! Emergency! All Daleks return to
control immediately!

**[Underground tunnel]**

(Maxtible obeys, and leaves.)  
VICTORIA: Poor Kemel.

**[Control room]**

(The Doctor watches the chaos from the doorway. The Emperor is badly damaged,
equipment is on fire, Daleks are screaming and dying. The Doctor goes to a
ventilation shaft, missing meeting Maxtible coming back.)  
MAXTIBLE: The Daleks must not, cannot be destroyed. The race will survive! The
Daleks will live and rule forever!  
(The Emperor's body collapses. The city falls apart in a series of
explosions.)

**[Skaro desert]**

JAMIE: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie!  
JAMIE: A Dalek nearly caught us, but I tossed it over the edge. But, poor
Kemel.  
DOCTOR: Kemel?  
JAMIE: Aye. You see, he was trying.  
VICTORIA: Where is my father? Is he dead?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm afraid he is. But he didn't die in vain. I think we've
seen the end of the Daleks forever. Jamie, we must get along to the Tardis.
It's over there.  
JAMIE: We can't leave her alone, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: We're not going to leave her. She's coming with us. The end. The final
end.

**[Control room]**

DALEKS: Destroy! Destroy! Argh!
