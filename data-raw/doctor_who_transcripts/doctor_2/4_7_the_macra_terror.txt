__**Episode One**__

**[Colony entrance]** (The entrance to the colony is futuristic, A crowd is
watching a drum majorette perform to the accompaniment of a band. The whole
place is like a holiday camp, with everyone smiling and enjoying themselves.)  
PILOT: Oh, splendid! Splendid! You've got a very good band there, Barney.  
BARNEY: Thank you, Pilot.  
PILOT: Mind you, I don't say you'll come first at the festival, but never say
die, what? Nothing succeeds like success. If at first you don't succeed  
ALL: Try, try, try again!  
PILOT: That's right.  
OLA: Stop him! Don't let him get out!  
PILOT: What's the matter? Medok!  
MEDOK: Let me go!  
PILOT: This is very foolish of you, Medok. It's for your own good.  
MEDOK: Out of my way!  
OLA: He's far too dangerous to be allowed to escape. Get after him! You should
have stopped him.  
PILOT: What happened, Ola?  
OLA: He refused treatment in front of my guards so I dismissed them and he
made a dash for it.  
PILOT: Well, get after him. He must not get away.

**[Countryside]**

(Ola and the guards chase Medok, who runs through puddles and clambers over
rocks to get away. He runs across some scrub then hides behind rocks and waits
for the guards to pass. Then the Tardis materialises nearby. Medok eyes it
suspiciously, and waits. The Doctor, Ben, Polly and Jamie come out.)  
BEN: Hey!  
POLLY: Oh! Oh, Ben, for goodness sake.  
BEN: Well, what's the big stick for, Jamie? Nothing's happened yet.  
JAMIE: Have you no sense? Have you forgotten what we saw on that time scanner?  
POLLY: Don't. It was horrible.  
JAMIE: Aye. Well, I'm not being left without nothing to defend ourselves with.  
DOCTOR: I'm afraid you're wasting your time, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Why?  
DOCTOR: Unless I'm very much mistaken, these creatures are so big they're
going to see us long before we see them.  
POLLY: Look out, Jamie!  
BEN: Hang on, mate. I'll get him.  
(Medok throws himself at Jamie, but Ben and Jamie overpower him.)  
POLLY: Jamie!  
DOCTOR: Go on, Ben.  
POLLY: Sit on top of him, Ben.  
JAMIE: That's just a  
POLLY: Ben, are you all right?  
(Then Ola and his guards arrive.)  
OLA: We don't know who you are, strangers, but we are grateful. Medok is one
of our last patients in the Colony. We've done our best for him but he gets
worse day by day. I wasn't informed you were travelling across our territory.
Hurry back to the Colony and tell the Pilot what's happened.  
BEN: Pilot?  
OLA: Yes, the Pilot of our Colony. No doubt he will want to thank you in
person. Tie him up tighter. Come on, tighter. I don't want any more trouble
with him. Come on, I'll show you myself.  
JAMIE: Er, any good asking?  
DOCTOR: Where we are? Well, according to my calculations we're certainly in
the future and on a planet very like the Earth.  
JAMIE: How do you know?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. I'm guessing.  
OLA: My name is Ola. I am the Chief of Police.  
POLLY: That sounds very important.  
OLA: Oh, it's a very responsible job. I take my instructions from our Control
centre. Oh, it all works very well, as you will see. Please follow me.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.  
(He turns to the guards who are tying up Medok.)  
DOCTOR: Not too tight. It's bad for the blood pressure.

**[Colony entrance]**

MUSIC: (in background all the time) Ra ra ra ra ra-ra ra ra! Danke shone,
danke schone. Number one! Tan tan tan tan tana ta tan! Danke schone two, danke
schone two (or something sounding very like it, anyway.)  
OLA: Pilot, these are the strangers that have helped us.  
PILOT: Very well, Ola. I will look after our guests. You will no doubt wish to
take care of poor Medok. You may leave. Well, our thanks to you and welcome.
You are indeed a brave man to tackle someone as disturbed as Medok.  
DOCTOR: Well, it was nothing. Anyone would have done the same. Well this is
gay. Why all the music?  
PILOT: Oh, we regulate our day by music. And now, my friends, I suggest you
take advantage of our refreshing department.  
BEN: Lead me to it mate. I'm starving.  
PILOT: Oh, you will eat later. Here we revive the weary body.  
DOCTOR: Oh.  
JAMIE: Keep your eyes skinned.  
POLLY: Why? What's the matter?  
JAMIE: They're a weird sort of folk. I don't know that I understand them.

**[Refreshing department]**

PILOT [OC]: Come along here, my friends. It's just around the corner.  
POLLY: It's so impressive.  
BARNEY: Pilot! Pilot! Control wish you to call them immediately. They wish to
welcome our guests.  
PILOT: Oh, but of course. Switch on please, my dear.  
(A screen lights up with the static picture of a man.)  
POLLY: Hey, who's that? He looks smashing.  
PILOT: That's our Controller.  
CONTROL [OC]: We wish to welcome joyfully the visitors to our colony. We are
very grateful to them. They have performed a valuable service. The Colony is
to make our guests happy and contented during their stay. Welcome again,
friends. Now, back to work everyone.  
POLLY: Well, that was great. I'm really going to enjoy myself.  
PILOT: Splendid! And now, my good friends, let me put you into the hands of
our supervisor, Barney. Dear old Barney, everybody calls him.  
BARNEY: Thank you, Pilot.  
PILOT: And I must leave you for work calls, you know. And hard work never hurt
anybody. Till later.  
(Pilot leaves.)  
BARNEY: Delighted to see you. Delighted to have you with us. Now, you have a
complete choice of all our treatments. We have steam baths, beauty treatments,
perhaps a massage. You, sir, of course, would like your clothes cleaned. And
there's sunlight treatment, moonlight treatment, sparkling and effervescent
sprays.  
DOCTOR: I feel perfectly all right as I am, thank you.  
POLLY: Oh go on, Doctor. Don't be such a drag. It all looks super. Please, may
I have a shampoo?  
BARNEY: Shampoo, of course, for the young lady.  
POLLY: Thanks very much.  
BARNEY: And for the young gentlemen, our very latest treatment in our cubicles
over there.  
JAMIE: Me? Oh, hey, no, you're not going to do that to me. I'm no lassie.  
BEN: It's no good, Jamie, the lassies have got you., And believe me mate, I'm
not going to struggle.  
(The boys are taken away by two young ladies.)  
BARNEY: And now, sir, for you.  
(Polly returns.)  
BARNEY: Oh, very nice. Very nice indeed. You must certainly be the most
beautiful young lady in our Colony, and are quite sure to be elected our next
beauty president.  
POLLY: Thank you very much.  
BARNEY: Oh, not at all. All part of our service. To your liking, sir?  
BEN: Ah, marvellous. Like being at anchor in the Med.  
BARNEY: Some protective oils for our guests and a little suntan.  
BEN: This the life.  
JAMIE: Hey, mister, would you call the ladies off? I'm frightened what they
might do to me.  
BARNEY: Oh, but you look charming, sir. Charming.  
JAMIE: That's what I'm frightened of.  
(The Doctor is in a strange machine. The lid opens to show his hair is neat
and flat now.)  
DOCTOR: Please get me out of here. I'm done to a turn.  
BARNEY: Clothes reviver.  
DOCTOR: My clothes don't need reviving.  
BARNEY: Oh, while we're about it, sir. And off.  
(The front of the machine opens. The Doctor comes out immaculately groomed.)  
POLLY: Oh, Doctor. You look gorgeous.  
DOCTOR: Oh, my shoes!  
BEN: Oh, they're fantastic. You can see your face in them.  
DOCTOR: Precisely. Who wants to see their face in a pair of suede shoes?
What's this one?  
BARNEY: Oh, that, sir, is our rough and tumble machine, for toning up the
muscles.  
DOCTOR: Exactly what I need. Full on!  
BARNEY: Oh, but no, sir! No!  
(General consternation.)  
POLLY: But your clothes!  
BEN: Get out. Oh, come out, Doctor.  
POLLY: Turn it off. Turn it off.  
BEN: Come out of it.  
POLLY: Come out of it, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, I feel better. Oh, that's more like it.  
(He is back to his previous rumpled self. Jamie enters.)  
POLLY: Oh, you look smashing. You really do. You look like a prince. Jamie,
that's super. It really is.

**[Colony]**

OLA: Come on, move back. This prisoner's not to be trusted. He's violent and
suffering from delusions.  
MEDOK: I'm not the one suffering from delusions, it's you. All of you! You
don't know what's happening in this Colony.  
OLA: Be quiet, Medok.  
MEDOK: There's only one way to silence me, Ola.  
QUESTA: Medok, old fellow, it's Questa. Remember me? What's happened to you?  
OLA: It's no good. You can't reason with him.  
QUESTA: Just a minute. He's an old friend. One of the best.  
OLA: Ha!  
QUESTA: He's as cheerful as any of us. Medok, what's happened to you? What's
all this about you seeing things?  
MEDOK: I don't see things, Questa, you fool. There are things. Horrible
things. Creatures infesting this camp at night.  
OLA: That's enough. Have you seen the Pilot?  
QUESTA: He's with the strangers. I've no idea where they are.  
CONTROL [OC]: Back to work. Shift rest is over. No time to be lost. The Colony
needs you. Preparation to be made for tonight's reception, a welcome for the
strangers.  
QUESTA: A reception tonight. A Colony party! Medok, join in with the rest of
us, like you used to.  
CONTROL [OC]: It will be fun for all!  
QUESTA: Do you hear that, Medok? Fun for all.  
MEDOK: All right! Have fun while you can, before they crawl all over you!  
OLA: That's enough! Right, get back all of you.

**[Refreshing department]**

DOCTOR: There you are. I wondered what had happened to you.  
MEDOK: I don't know you. You don't belong here.  
DOCTOR: Do you belong here?  
MEDOK: No, not any more.  
OLA: We don't talk to him. He sees things. Come on, Medok.  
(Ola pushes Medok through a door, locks it and leaves. The Doctor start to
pick the lock. A young woman approaches.)  
CHICKI: Can I help you?  
DOCTOR: What? Oh, no. No, its all right, thank you. I just thought I'd dropped
something, that's all.  
(She leaves. The Doctor finishes picking the lock and goes inside.)

**[Medok's cell]**

MEDOK: Ah! What's the game?  
DOCTOR: I'm going to set you free. Just hold still a minute. There we are. One
more. Don't bother to say thank you. Now, tell me something about these things
that you see. Do they, for instance, appear to crawl slowly over the ground?  
MEDOK: How do you know?  
DOCTOR: Oh, just wondered, that's all.  
MEDOK: Listen.  
DOCTOR: I don't hear anything.  
MEDOK: Someone's coming.  
DOCTOR: It's all right, I won't let them hurt you.  
MEDOK: Get out of my way.  
DOCTOR: Why don't you listen to me?  
MEDOK: I am not being caught!  
(Medok runs out.)  
OLA: Stop him! Don't let him escape!  
PILOT: How did he get away? Who's responsible? What happened?  
DOCTOR: I told him he wouldn't get hurt and he wouldn't believe me.  
PILOT: You mean you let him go?  
DOCTOR: Well, no, not exactly.  
OLA: He let the prisoner escape. That is a crime in this Colony. For that men
must work in the pit. Guards!  
POLLY: You can't touch him. He doesn't know your laws.  
PILOT: That's true, Ola. He is a stranger here.  
DOCTOR: There's something else you forgetting, gentlemen. I set free someone
that we caught in the first place.  
PILOT: True. A reasonable point of view, Ola.  
OLA: Medok is dangerous. He should have never let him go. The Colony will be
petrified when they know he's out there in the night.  
PILOT: Well, send your patrol after him. He can't have got far.  
DOCTOR: He can run, you know. He's got legs. He doesn't have to crawl over the
ground.  
OLA: Why do you say that?  
DOCTOR: No reason. No reason at all.  
OLA: Anyone who spreads that kind of rumour in this Colony will find himself
in the hospital for correction.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, that's where Medok lives, is it?  
PILOT: I think, Doctor, you will understand more about Medok if you talk to
some of the people who knew him best.  
OLA: Pilot, I think  
PILOT: Now take the strangers to the labour centre, Ola. See they learn
something about us. Pete, go with him.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, thank you.

**[Building site]**

(On the way to the labour centre they pass a building site. The Doctor spots
Medok hiding in the shadows.)  
GUARD: What is it?  
GUARD 2: Nothing, come on.

**[Labour centre]**

CONTROL [OC}: This is your Controller speaking. There is no need for alarm.
You may all continue your work and play confident that the best is being done
for you. But our unfortunate companion Medok has been allowed to escape.
Emergency Patrols two and three are now searching the Colony, and he is sure
to be caught before it is dark. Now, return to your work and play with fresh
heart and renewed energy.  
BEN: They've got that bloke all over the place like a blinking politician.  
PETE: He is our Controller. We're always pleased to see him. He brings us
encouragement.  
BEN: Oh, he's not a politician then.  
CONTROL [OC]: Number nine shift to stand by. Leader to report to Youth Centre.  
PETE: Work shift ready to leave.  
MUSIC: (in background) We're happy to work, we're happy to play.)  
JAMIE: That's a nice wee tune, Doctor.  
BEN: Yeah, if you happen to like work.  
PETE: It's a privilege to work for the Colony.  
SHIFT LEADER: Shift leader reporting. Shift number nine, all present and
correct.  
OFFICIA: Good. You're the first of the night shifts.  
JAMIE: What do you do then? Farming or fishing?  
OFFICIA: We work very hard here.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but what do you do?  
OFFICIA: We tap and refine gas.  
POLLY: For heating?  
OFFICIA: No, we use it for many things. The Colony depends on it. It's
absolutely essential. Emergency!  
(Two young miners stagger in.)  
OFFICIA: Quick, give me that. Come on.  
SHIFT LEADER: Accident. Stand by, oxygen supply.  
OFFICIA: Take them away. Any other losses?  
PETE: Two with gas sickness. Come on.  
BEN: What happened?  
OFFICIA: Their work. It can't be helped. Work must be done.  
POLLY: Do you hear that, Doctor? Where's he gone?

**[Building site]**

DOCTOR: I saw you.  
MEDOK: Get out.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's not very polite. I was interested in what you were saying.  
MEDOK: Who else knows I'm here?  
DOCTOR: No one. Why should I tell them? Now, these creatures. Have you seen
them clearly? What do they look like?  
MEDOK: What's it got to do with you?  
DOCTOR: But I'm interested. What do they look like?  
MEDOK: All right, if you really want to know. It's hard to say. They move at
night, in the dark. And horrible. Creatures like giant insects.  
DOCTOR: With big claws?  
MEDOK: Yes, that's it.  
DOCTOR: You've seen them in the Colony?  
MEDOK: Oh, yes.  
DOCTOR: Has anyone else seen them?  
MEDOK: A few, but they lock them up in the correction hospital.  
DOCTOR: Why do they do that?  
MEDOK: Control tells them to. They'll put me back there when they catch me.
They'll put you back there for helping me.  
BEN + JAMIE [OC]: Doctor! Doctor!  
MEDOK: Go on, quickly. They're looking for you.  
BEN: Doctor!

**[Refreshing department]**

POLLY: But we searched there, I'm sure.  
JAMIE: Aye.  
(Someone is playing a descant recorder.)  
DOCTOR: Were you looking for me? I was just looking around, that's all.  
OLA: It's dangerous to go off on your own after dark.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm used to the dark. I like it.  
OLA: We're confined to rest cubicles at night by order of Control. Anyone who
wanders round the Colony at night may be killed.  
CONTROL [OC]: Curfew time. All personnel not on duty must retire to quarters.  
OLA: Do you hear that?  
CONTROL [OC]: Emergency patrols two and three to remain on duty. Work shifts
to remain at their posts until dawn. Visitors to retire for the night to the
refreshing department.  
OLA: That's you. You're confined here.

**[Doctor's cubicle]**

BARNEY: Here we are, Doctor. Your young friends are in their rooms over there.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
BARNEY: I hope you sleep well.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sure I will. Thank you. Goodnight.  
BARNEY: Goodnight, Doctor.  
(As soon as Barney is gone the Doctor goes out via the refreshing dept.)

**[Refreshing department]**

CONTROL [OC]: It is now dark. No one will go outside into the Colony. A
dangerous man is in hiding. Our patrols have orders to shoot on sight. Happy
sleep time, everybody.  
DOCTOR: Same to you.

**[Colony grounds]**

(The Doctor avoids a patrol lead by Ola. There are very strange night sounds
going on.)

**[Building site]**

OLA [OC]: Patrol two, over here, Patrol three, follow me. If you see him,
shoot to kill. I'll have a look over there.  
DOCTOR: It's all right. It's me. Stay where you are.  
MEDOK: Why are you back?  
DOCTOR: Don't move.  
OLA [OC]: Have a look in those new houses they're building.  
MEDOK: He's coming. We'll have to get out.  
DOCTOR: Wait. If he comes in this way, we go out the back. If he comes in the
back way, we'll go out ahead here.  
MEDOK: Yes, all right. He's coming to the front of the house.  
OLA [OC]: Over here. I heard something.  
DOCTOR: All right, go back.  
MEDOK: You can't stay here.  
DOCTOR: I'll try to create a diversion.  
MEDOK: They'll kill you!  
DOCTOR: Do as I tell you.  
MEDOK: Thanks.  
DOCTOR: Go on. Go on. All right, we'll go through this opening when I give the
word. Right, now.  
MEDOK: No. Look out there.  
DOCTOR: I don't see anything.  
MEDOK: In that patch of moonlight. I told you I'd seen them.  
(In front of them is a hideous crab-like creature.)

__**Episode Two**__

**[Building site]**

(The crab-like creature vanishes into the night.)  
MEDOK: That proves it. I wasn't seeing things.  
DOCTOR: Medok. The guards, they'll hear you.  
MEDOK: It doesn't matter. They can't lock me up again. Now I can prove it. We
know they're real.  
DOCTOR: Medok.  
OLA: Medok. I know you're in there. Come out quietly.  
MEDOK: You can put that gun away. I'm coming.  
OLA: Who's with you?  
MEDOK: The Doctor.  
OLA: What are you doing here?  
MEDOK: Don't waste time. Come on over here.  
OLA: Stay where you are.  
MEDOK: Listen, I came out to show you.  
OLA: Stand still!  
MEDOK: It's the Macra, Ola! They are real! Ask the Doctor. He'll tell you.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can confirm.  
OLA: We don't want to know what the strangers think.  
DOCTOR: Well, it might be as well to  
OLA: Where do you think you're going?  
DOCTOR: I just thought I'd go and have a look.  
OLA: Stay where you are. Guard, search him.  
DOCTOR: What will they do to us?  
OLA: I'll tell you. You're going before the Pilot. You were in the company of
an escaped criminal and you were out in the Colony at night.  
MEDOK: I'm sorry, Doctor. I thought he'd listen to reason.  
DOCTOR: Reason's the last thing a man like Ola will listen to.  
MEDOK: You're going to be in trouble, and it's my fault.  
OLA: Silence! Pilot's headquarters. Move!

**[Pilot's office]**

(The Colony Pilot is making his announcements.)  
PILOT: Shifts to stand by for greater efforts during working hours. The gas
from the pits must be kept in constant supply at even greater pressures.
Remember the life of the colony is dependent upon this gas. All industry and
activity  
(An alarm sounds.)  
VOICE [OC]: Emergency call. Emergency call.  
PILOT: Yes. Go ahead, Emergency.  
VOICE [OC]: Ola requests audience immediately. Ola requests audience
immediately.  
PILOT: Look, I'm extremely busy. Unless this is a major crisis, I really don't  
VOICE [OC]: Medok has been taken prisoner and one of the strangers has been
captured with him.  
PILOT: Bring the stranger in.  
DOCTOR: Good evening, Pilot. Oh, what a very nice office you have here.  
PILOT: Now what's this all about, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Well, I  
OLA: We found both of them in the new buildings, Pilot.  
PILOT: At night? How did he get there? Wasn't there a guard on his sleeping
quarters?  
OLA: All my guards were out looking for Medok, Pilot.  
PILOT: I see. Very well, you may leave us, Ola. I will conduct the
investigation myself.  
(Ola leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, forgive me. This is interesting. A telescopic viewing machine. I
imagine you can keep track on the entire Colony from here and direct
intercommunication between all parts. Very up to date, I imagine. Excellent,
excellent. And what  
PILOT: You don't seem to realise how serious this business is, Doctor. You
have committed a crime.  
DOCTOR: A crime?  
PILOT: What were you doing with Medok? You know he's a dangerous man.  
DOCTOR: I'm not so sure, Pilot.  
PILOT: You have already been told. He has refused to cooperate and to obey
orders. He suffers from hallucinations.  
DOCTOR: Ah, that's the point. Does he?  
PILOT: What exactly do you mean by that?  
DOCTOR: Let me perhaps explain.  
(The intercom buzzes.)  
PILOT: What is it now? I've already said I don't want to be interrupted.  
OLA: Ola reporting, Pilot.  
PILOT: Well, what is it?  
OLA: Medok has made a statement. It completely changes the situation.  
PILOT: Oh, very well. Bring him in.  
DOCTOR: I hope you're not going to listen to everything that Medok tells you?  
PILOT: Why, Doctor? Are you afraid of something he might say?  
DOCTOR: Well, in his state of mind he might say anything.  
(Ola and Medok enter.)  
MEDOK: Doctor. How have they been treating you?  
OLA: Silence.  
DOCTOR: Perfectly all right, thank you.  
OLA: Medok's made a further statement, Pilot. It's about the Doctor.  
PILOT: Ah.  
DOCTOR: Ah.  
PILOT: Yes, Medok?  
MEDOK: The Doctor wasn't helping me. He was trying to make me give myself up.  
PILOT: Well, that was extremely brave. Why didn't you tell us this?  
DOCTOR: Well, as a matter of fact  
MEDOK: Captain Ola didn't give him a chance.  
PILOT: I see. Well, it seems we owe you an apology, Doctor.  
MEDOK: It's better we tell the truth, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Thank you, Medok. I quite understand.  
PILOT: Take him away.  
OLA: Come on, Medok.  
(Ola and Medok.)  
PILOT: Well, I'm extremely sorry about it, Doctor, and of course you're free
to go.  
DOCTOR: What will happen to Medok?  
PILOT: Oh, well, he'll be taken back to the hospital for correction. He'll be
given another course of treatment. And when he returns to the Colony, Medok
will be a changed man. He will cooperate and he will obey orders. He'll be
just like the rest of us.  
DOCTOR: Why do you want everyone to be the same?  
PILOT: Doctor, this Colony was founded many centuries ago by our ancestors who
came from the Earth planet, like your young friends. Our ancestors believed in
the virtues of healthy happiness and we have tried to keep their ideals alive.
Sometimes, alas, it is necessary to use force. (into intercom) The Doctor will
be returning to his quarters now.  
VOICE [OC]: The Doctor's escort is ready.  
PILOT: Well, I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Doctor, and many thanks again
for your help.  
DOCTOR: Not at all. Thank you. Goodnight.  
(The Doctor goes to the door, but it is locked.)  
PILOT: Oh, I'm so sorry. Goodnight.  
(The Doctor leaves. The screen comes alive with the static image of the
Controller.)  
CONTROL [OC]: The Doctor and his friends are to be given the advantage of high
powered adaption at once. They must begin to think like members of the Colony.
They are to have deep sleep and thinking patterns. We cannot have criticism
from these strangers! The work to do it, it must begin immediately.  
PILOT: Emergency order from Control, top priority. Are all the cubicles
connected?  
VOICE [OC]: The rest cubicles for the four strangers are all connected for
deep sleep and thought patterns.  
PILOT: Very good. The process is to begin immediately. Your instructions are
being carried out.  
CONTROL [OC]: That is good. This is an emergency. Control must be believed and
obeyed! No one on the Colony believes in Macra! There is no such thing as
Macra! Macra do not exist! There are no Macra!

**[Jamie + Ben's cubicle]**

(Ben is asleep, but Jamie is restless.)  
VOICE [OC]: The sleeper must relax and believe. Everything in the Colony is
good and beautiful. You must accept it without question. You must obey orders.
The leaders of the Colony know what is best. In the morning when you wake up
you will be given some work. You will be glad to obey. You will question
nothing in the Colony.  
JAMIE: Ben? Ben?  
BEN: What is it?  
JAMIE: I heard something.  
BEN: Oh, you're always hearing something.  
JAMIE: I never heard a voice like this before. Ben?  
BEN: I'm asleep.  
JAMIE: It was evil, Ben. An evil voice. An evil that spoke so gently and yet I
almost believed what it said.  
BEN: Oh, look, mate, get some sleep. We've got a hard day's work ahead of us
tomorrow.  
JAMIE: Why do you say that?  
BEN: Well, we've got to do something to help in the Colony. We can't just eat
their nosh without helping out.  
JAMIE: You sound just like that voice, Ben.  
BEN: Oh, what are you on about? This Colony's all right. It wouldn't be too
bad to work here.  
JAMIE: I never heard you talk that way before, Ben.  
(Ben goes back to sleep.)  
VOICE [OC]: You will not resist the sleeping gas. Breathe deeply. In the
morning, when you wake, you will obey.

**[Polly's cubicle]**

(The Doctor enters, trying not to wake Polly. He examines the wall and finds a
hidden wire. He shorts this out, causing a small explosion.)  
DOCTOR: Wake up, Polly.  
POLLY: Doctor? What on earth are you doing?  
DOCTOR: I've been scotching a rumour. Or should I say scorching.  
POLLY: What happened?  
DOCTOR: Polly, I think you've been listening to some very bad advice.  
POLLY: But I've been asleep.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know you have. Fast asleep. Very fast asleep. Polly, do you
smell anything? A sort of sweet perfume?  
POLLY: No.  
DOCTOR: Never mind. Now, Polly, I want you to forget everything that you've
been dreaming.  
POLLY: Why do you say that?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's just possible that you've been given a series of orders
while you've been asleep. You know, do this, do that, do the other thing. My
advice to you is don't do anything of the sort. Don't just be obedient. Always
make up your own mind. What am I thinking of? Ben and Jamie!

**[Jamie + Ben's cubicle]**

BEN: Hello, Doctor. Is it morning?  
DOCTOR: No, not yet, but nearly so.  
BEN: What are you up to?  
DOCTOR: Well, by my calculations, there should be a thin strand of wire in the
wall here, like a nerve tapping the subconscious of the human brain.  
BEN: Lay off, mate. You'll find yourself on a charge.  
DOCTOR: It should be here somewhere. Ah!  
BEN: Pack it in, Doctor. The way you mess about you could do some damage.  
DOCTOR: Better some damage than loss of will power.  
BEN: What are you on about? Look, get out of it. It's against the law.  
DOCTOR: What law?  
BEN: The law of the Colony. Don't do that! (The Doctor shorts the wire.) Now
you'll get chucked in jail.  
POLLY: What's the matter with you, Ben? Since when did you start to worry?  
BEN: He thinks he knows best all the time, but this time he's wrong.  
JAMIE: Hey, what's all the noise?  
DOCTOR: Jamie, how did you sleep?  
JAMIE: Oh, very badly, Doctor. I told Ben I kept hearing wee voices.  
DOCTOR: That's a good sign. That means they haven't been able to get very
deeply into your brain.  
JAMIE: Ay? I don't understand?  
DOCTOR: I'll show you. Watch this.  
(He burns out another circuit)  
BEN: You're fools, all of you! And just look what you've done. You've smashed
up all this equipment.  
POLLY: Yes, but look here. If they were trying to make us believe a whole load
of rubbish  
BEN: Rubbish? It's not rubbish. Control knows what's best for us. They want us
to cooperate. We should be helping.  
POLLY: What's the matter with you, Ben? This doesn't sound like you at all.  
BEN: We should learn to obey. The Doctor's causing trouble. I'm going to turn
him in.  
JAMIE: You don't know what you're doing, Ben.  
BEN: Get off me!  
POLLY: What's the matter with him?  
DOCTOR: I'm very much afraid I'm too late.  
POLLY: Ben!  
BEN: Let go of me.  
POLLY: Ben!  
BEN: Guards! Guards!  
POLLY: Don't let him go.  
DOCTOR: No, it's no use, Jamie. JAMIE: But we cannot let him go, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You'll have to. Violence will get you nowhere. POLLY: Doctor, he's
going to go and tell the guards. We've got to get you out of here. DOCTOR: We
can't leave Ben.  
JAMIE: But he's betrayed you.  
DOCTOR: No, no, not Ben. He's not in control of his actions. He's been given a
series of instructions and he can't help himself.  
POLLY: Yes, but he  
BEN: That's him! He prodded about in the wall and smashed up our equipment.  
OLA: This time we've got the evidence, and from one of your own friends. Come
on, Doctor.  
JAMIE: Leave him alone.  
OLA: Get out of my way. That's an order.  
JAMIE: I take orders from no one but the Doctor.  
OLA: All right, you're coming too. Get out, both of you!  
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jamie, but I'd better go with Captain Ola.  
POLLY: But Doctor, what will they do to you?  
BEN: He should be in that hospital of yours.  
JAMIE: You traitor, you.  
OLA: That's enough!  
(Ola leaves with the Doctor and Jamie)  
BEN: The hospital! He needs correction more than Medok does.

**[Hospital ward]**

(Medok is strapped to a bed. The voice drones on in the background.)  
VOICE [OC]: You wish to cooperate. You have seen no strange creatures. You
will work hard and happily. Hard and happily. You wish to cooperate. You have
seen no strange creatures.  
PILOT: It's a very difficult case, I'm afraid. Nothing much we can do. He's
too far gone to help. No, he'll never be happy like the rest of us. All we can
do is send him to the pits for life.  
MEDOK: Can't hide the truth.  
(An intercom buzzes.)  
PILOT: Yes, what is it? What's that? The Doctor? I'll come at once. Keep at
it.

**[Jamie + Ben's cubicle]**

POLLY: What did you do it for? The Doctor's our friend.  
BEN: I had to do my duty.  
POLLY: Well, you go on doing it, then. I'm going to go and find out where the
others have gone.  
BEN: Look, Polly, you'd better stay here.  
POLLY: Go on, report me.  
BEN: Now look. Come back, Polly. Polly? Polly!

**[Building site]**

(Ben is searching the site.)  
BEN: Polly, where are you? Polly? You'll be in trouble. Don't fool about,
Polly. You must obey Control. Polly? Stop!  
POLLY: Leave me alone!  
BEN: You're coming back to the guard.  
POLLY: What's the matter with you, Ben? Wake up!  
BEN: You're coming with me, girl. You broke the Colony law.  
(Polly screams.)  
BEN: What's the matter with you?  
POLLY: There.  
BEN: There's nothing there.  
POLLY: But there was. I saw it. A huge face, like an insect, or a giant crab.
It was horrible and it was looking at us and it had claws. Claws like we saw
on the time scanner.  
BEN: There's nothing there. Come on.  
POLLY: No, not that way.  
BEN: Look, you're just trying to dodge off.  
POLLY: No, no, please, I'm not. But please look.  
BEN: There is nothing there!  
POLLY: Ben.  
(Something appears.)  
POLLY: What is it?  
BEN: I don't know.  
POLLY: Well, what are we going to do?  
BEN: There is nothing evil or harmful in this colony.  
POLLY: How can you believe that stuff?  
BEN: It stands to reason. It's safe. There is nothing here!  
(A giant claw grabs Polly, who naturally screams. Ben grabs a piece of timber
and hits it to no effect.)  
POLLY: Ben, what is this? Get it off me, Ben! It's got my foot! Ben! Help me,
Ben! Help me!  
(Eventually the creature lets Polly go, and leaves.)  
POLLY: Oh, it was horrible!  
BEN: It's all right. I think it's going away.  
POLLY: Let's go inside. Ben, behind you! There's another one! Ben, they're all
around us!  
BEN: Look, Polly, you make a run for it, and I'll keep them here.  
POLLY: No, you won't stand a chance.  
BEN: We can't stop here. Come on, quick!

**[Pilot's office]**

PILOT: You have destroyed three nerve circuits, Doctor. You have burned them
out. What have you to say?  
DOCTOR: Rather neat, don't you think? And so simple. I did it with this.  
PILOT: You admit it?  
DOCTOR: I'm proud of it.  
PILOT: What is it? What's the matter?  
DOCTOR: My dear Pilot, your wall? Even you are subjected to this form of
subconscious control?  
PILOT: Leave that alone.  
(The Doctor shorts another wire.)  
DOCTOR: That's better.  
PILOT: You will be punished for this.  
DOCTOR: The least you can do is to say thank you.  
OLA: Pilot!  
PILOT: What is it?  
OLA: It's the young man who reported the Doctor, Pilot.  
PILOT: What about him?  
OLA: He has another report, Pilot. An urgent one.  
PILOT: Very well, Ola, you may leave. I will deal with it.  
(Ben and Polly enter.)  
JAMIE: Who are you stabbing in the back this time?  
DOCTOR: Polly? Polly? What's the matter?  
POLLY: Doctor, it was horrible. A great insect, like a crab. It got hold of
me. Ben got me free.  
JAMIE: Ben did?  
POLLY: And he was nearly killed himself.  
PILOT: Silence. Did you protect the girl from such creatures?  
BEN: She ran away. I went after her.  
PILOT: Did you protect her, and were there such creatures?  
BEN: No. There were no such creatures.  
POLLY: Ben!  
BEN: There are no such things as Macra.  
POLLY: But you saw them!  
BEN: There were no such creatures! There are no such things as Macra!  
DOCTOR: Don't blame him, Polly.  
JAMIE: But you heard him.  
DOCTOR: I told you. Ben has come under control of the evil forces at the heart
of this colony.  
PILOT: That is quite untrue. Control always acts for the best.  
DOCTOR: Who is Control?  
PILOT: You've seen our Controller.  
DOCTOR: Have I? I don't remember.  
PILOT: Well, switch on then. We've nothing to hide.  
CONTROL [OC]: Controller speaking. We know everything that's happened. The
poor girl has had hallucinations.  
JAMIE: That's not the Controller. That's just a picture of a man.  
PILOT: It is the picture of our Controller.  
JAMIE: Well, where is he? I'll wager he doesn't exist.  
PILOT: Of course he does.  
JAMIE: Well, let's see him then.  
PILOT: That's not necessary.  
JAMIE: Well, I don't believe he's there.  
PILOT: Of course he is. You've heard his voice.  
DOCTOR: Why don't you show him to us then?  
PILOT: Well, all right, if you wish, I'll ask. As you can hear, Control, they
ask to see you in person.  
DOCTOR: That set the cat among the pigeons.  
JAMIE: They've not got him there.  
CONTROL [OC]: This is your Controller. This is your Controller.  
JAMIE: But he's an old man.  
PILOT: Well, now you've seen the Controller.  
JAMIE: Well, let him speak.  
CONTROL [OC]: Be silent! That is an order!  
POLLY: Let him speak.  
PILOT: Be silent!  
JAMIE: Ah, he's not giving the orders. He can't talk.  
CONTROL [OC]: This is the man. You will hear him speak. Speak, Controller,
speak!  
CONTROLLER [on screen]: Speak? Am I to speak?  
CONTROL [OC]: Tell the strangers to believe and obey!  
CONTROLLER [on screen]: I will tell them. I will tell them. I'll do what you
say.  
(The old man is an emaciated dishevelled wreck.)  
CONTROLLER [on screen]: Keep away. Don't touch me. I'll obey.  
JAMIE: What's that? What's happening?  
(A claw appears on the screen and drags the old man away.)  
POLLY: Doctor, that was it. That thing in the picture, that was the claw!
They're in control.  

__**Episode Three**__

**[Pilot's office]**

PILOT: Take them out of here. They're condemned to the pits.  
OLA: Come on. Get out, all of you. Out! Get out!  
(The Doctor, Polly and Jamie are taken away.)  
PILOT: (to intercom) Stand by work shift. Stand by in the pits.  
VOICE [OC]: Work shift standing by.  
PILOT: The strangers are being sent to you for pit labour. Put them in the
Danger Gang.  
CONTROL [OC]: Your orders are correct, Pilot. The strangers must be sent to
explore the new gas reserve. They are dangerous people. They must be
disciplined.  
PILOT: Yes, Control.  
CONTROL [OC]: You will forget all that happened.  
PILOT: Yes, Control.  
CONTROL [OC]: The Colony enjoys hard work and happiness. We will not tolerate
the evil of such strangers.  
PILOT: Yes, Control. You must serve the Colony. Keep watch on your friends and
if you see anything suspicious, report to me immediately.  
BEN: Yes, Pilot.

**[Pithead]**

MUSIC [OC]: We are all happy to work. We are all happy to work. For the good
of the Colony. Happy to work. Happy to work.  
DOCTOR: Oh!  
POLLY: What's the matter?  
DOCTOR: Dreadful. Did you hear that rhyme? The man who wrote that ought to be
sent to the Danger Gang, not us.  
OLA: All right. That's enough.  
OFFICIA: Ah, are these the three strangers?  
OLA: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Yes, you might call us that.  
OLA: They've been allocated 176 shift.  
OFFICIA: Oh, very good, Ola. I'll recall the shift leader.  
(He does so as the Doctor speaks over him.)  
DOCTOR: What an extremely remarkable place. What efficiency. Whatever do you
make?  
OLA: Silence.  
JAMIE: I thought this was a mine, you know, where you dig up coal?  
OFFICIA: Ah, yes, but here, you see, the rock foundation is a type of salt.
Now at depths it generates gases, over the years, and these gases are
extremely valuable.  
OLA: Don't bother to explain to them. Just get them to work.  
JAMIE: Aye. well, you don't send a lassie and an old man down to dig.  
DOCTOR: Old? What do you mean old? I'm not old, Jamie.  
OLA: You'll do as you're ordered.  
OFFICIA: Here's the leader of the their shift, sir.  
OLA: Very well. Report any irregularities to me.  
JAMIE: Medok! How did you get here?  
MEDOK: They threw me out of the correction hospital. Apparently I'm a hopeless
case.  
POLLY: But why did they send you here?  
MEDOK: The one remaining punishment they could think of. To work in the Danger
Gang for life.  
JAMIE: For life?  
MEDOK: Oh, don't worry, you don't survive long in this atmosphere. It's the
gas. It gets everywhere. It creeps into your lungs. And when you're down
there, you're right in the thick of it.  
OFFICIA: Come on, Medok. Take them to their work.  
MEDOK: What's the hurry?  
OFFICIA: You don't want me to call the guard, do you?  
MEDOK: All right, all right, we're going. But we are entitled to a supervisor
on this shift.  
OFFICIA: Oh, yes, that's true.  
MEDOK: Yes. Well, I'm leaving this man.  
OFFICIA: Hmm? Oh, well, yes. I suppose that's all right.  
DOCTOR: But it's much safer up here. Isn't it, Medok?  
MEDOK: It is.  
DOCTOR: Ah. I see. I'm perfectly capable of working in the pit, thank you.
Polly can have the safe job.  
POLLY: Oh no, you stay up here, Doctor. I wouldn't know what to do.  
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure I understand all this machinery myself.  
JAMIE: Do you not think you might make better use of the opportunity, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: What do you mean? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes, I'll be supervisor.  
OFFICIA: What was all that?  
DOCTOR: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.  
OFFICIA: Come on, you two.  
MEDOK: Oh, you're going to issue them with masks, aren't you? You aren't
taking them down there without any protection?  
OFFICIA: Surely you could have seen to that? Oh, here. You'd better take this
checklist.  
DOCTOR: But would have liked a mask.  
(The group head for the underground shaft as Ben enters.)  
DOCTOR: This really is remarkable. Most interesting. Yes, I suppose with a
little adjustment. Hello, Ben. Don't go. Come in. Don't be afraid.  
BEN: I have nothing to be afraid of.  
DOCTOR: No, of course not. It wasn't your fault you betrayed your friends.  
BEN: The voices tell me what to do.  
DOCTOR: The voices may not be right, Ben.  
BEN: I do what I am told.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. That's why you're here, isn't it? To spy on me. What does
Control want to know this time? Can't you answer me? You know, Ben, this is
very unlike you.  
BEN: I don't know what you mean. It is my duty.  
DOCTOR: It's hard for you to struggle against the voices, isn't it, Ben? But I
warn you, if you spy on the others, watch out Jamie doesn't catch you. He's
not so tolerant as I am.

**[Gas mine]**

OFFICIA: Hurry up. Put on your equipment.  
JAMIE: You shouldn't make lassies do the work of men.  
OFFICIA: The Danger Gang will do as they are told. It's a punishment for their
failure to cooperate.  
MEDOK: We do all the dirty work. We go where the gas is worst.  
OFFICIA: It's your own fault, Medok. If you obeyed Control  
MEDOK: All right. All right. Forget it. I prefer Control poisoning my lungs to
their trying to poison my mind.  
(An alarm sounds.)  
POLLY: What's that?  
MEDOK: It's a gas strike.  
OFFICIA: Go on. Help with the cable there. Go on, hurry up. That's the alarm.
This gas is lethal.  
JAMIE: What does he mean?  
MEDOK: He means they've struck so much gas they can't channel it off. When it
reaches a certain density, that alarm bell goes.  
OFFICIA: Hurry up! Get that cable to the strike.  
MEDOK: Come on, quickly.  
(Polly, Jamie, and Medok help other workers drag the cable along the shaft.)  
OFFICIA: Quickly. Come on. Pull there. Pull, all of you. Pull! Pull!  
JAMIE: Polly!  
OFFICIA: Leave her. Get that cable to the strike.  
MEDOK: Get her away from here. Away. Jamie, the head of the cable, got it!
Right! Now put your masks on. They're in your pockets. Right, now help me with
this. Hold it. Hold it, Jamie, hold it. Right.  
(The leak is sealed.)  
POLLY: What's it all for?  
MEDOK: For a poisonous gas which we mine from the bowels of this planet, which
kills us if we breathe it. No one knows what it's used for.

**[Pithead]**

(The Doctor is chalking calculations on the wall.)  
DOCTOR: Yes. Now, one must assume that the relative connection is constant.
Now, let me see. Ah. Yes, I think that's right. I shall give myself ten out of
ten.  
(The Pilot enters.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, you did give me a turn.  
PILOT: Where did you find it?  
DOCTOR: What?  
PILOT: The formula.  
DOCTOR: In my head. You know.  
PILOT: Don't lie. That is a secret known only to three people in the Colony.  
DOCTOR: And you're one of them, I'd say.  
PILOT: Naturally. And you're not asking me to believe that in a few moments
you have been able to work out a formula which it has taken our combined
computers years to perfect?  
DOCTOR: It does seem rather a tall order.  
PILOT: Yes, of course. I know what you've done. You've broken into our secret
files, haven't you?  
DOCTOR: I wouldn't know how to do that. Take a look.  
PILOT: Well, you must have seen the document. That's the exact computation.  
DOCTOR: Really? Huh. In that case  
(He alters his mark to eleven out of ten.)  
PILOT: Do you really mean to say that you worked that out by yourself?  
DOCTOR: Well, I did have a little assistance.  
PILOT: Yes, I thought so. Who was it?  
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. No person. No. I simply mean that I took
readings from the various dials. They appeared to be related, so I worked out
the principle that controlled them. It was simple really. Like doing a sum
backwards.  
PILOT: Backwards?  
DOCTOR: Yes. You know. Given the answer, what's the question?  
PILOT: Wipe it away. Get it off there before anybody else sees it.  
DOCTOR: Oh well, if you insist.  
(The Doctor throws a bucket of water at the wall.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, there now. If anyone follows that formula there'll be an almighty
explosion. X to the power of y is derivative 2 3's of 6!  
PILOT: Get it off.

**[Gas mine]**

POLLY: What are they doing?  
MEDOK: We call that probing.  
POLLY: They're not looking for more gas?  
MEDOK: Oh, yes. We never stop.  
JAMIE: There's a door here. Where does it lead to?  
MEDOK: I've no idea. To my knowledge those doors were never opened.  
JAMIE: Could be an old shaft.  
POLLY: Why would it need such a new door? And so strong?  
MEDOK: Hey, look out!  
OFFICIA: Ah, you've made the connection?  
MEDOK: Of course. Otherwise you wouldn't be here.  
OFFICIA: Now, be careful, Medok. There are other places worse than the Danger
Gang, you know. This is a high pressure strike. You are going to need a
stronger screw than this.  
MEDOK: Don't touch it.  
OFFICIA: I know what I'm doing.  
(Ben watching a leak of gas catch Officia, who staggers back. Medok hammers
the screw back and Jamie takes Officia's keys.)  
POLLY: He's fainted.  
JAMIE: Aye. He must have.  
BEN: What's the matter? What has happened to him?  
JAMIE: He's had a wee whiff of the gas.  
BEN: Get him up. I'll look after him. Yeah, it's all right, mate. Hang on.  
(Ben helps Officia away.)  
POLLY: How long do you think Ben was watching us?  
JAMIE: I don't know.  
POLLY: Do you think he saw you take the keys?  
JAMIE: Well, if he did, we're in trouble.  
POLLY: Yes.  
JAMIE: It just means we'll have to make use of them as quick as we can.  
POLLY: But where, Jamie. And how?  
JAMIE: Let's try that wee door first. Come on. Give me the word if anybody
comes.  
POLLY: Right. Look out. Okay.  
MEDOK: Hey you two, give us a hand.  
POLLY: All right. I'd better go.  
JAMIE: Just a minute Polly. This key's turning. Oh.  
POLLY: Good luck.  
JAMIE: Aye. It fits. Come on, Pol.  
MEDOK: Come on here, everybody. Lend a hand.  
(Jamie is through the door, and goes carefully along the shaft.)  
(An alarm sounds.)  
POLLY: What's that?  
MEDOK: It's impossible.  
POLLY: Is it more gas?  
MEDOK: No, it's an escape. That bell means that someone has escaped down here.  
POLLY: It's Jamie.  
MEDOK: Your friend? That door! I'm going with him.  
POLLY: Hey, wait! Don't leave me down here.

**[Pithead]**

OFFICIA: We couldn't have an alarm. It's impossible. No one ever escapes.
Calling Pit Guard. Close exits to all gas shafts. Stand by. A prisoner has
escaped. Shoot on sight.  
DOCTOR: But, if no one can escape  
OFFICIA: My keys. My keys! They were on my tunic.  
BEN: You must have dropped them.  
OFFICIA: Special guards to cover all exits to the old shaft. With Pilot's
permission, they may have to go on forbidden ground.

**[Old shaft]**

MEDOK: Jamie? Jamie? Jamie? Ah!  
(A huge claw grabs Medok by the throat and throws him to the ground.)  
JAMIE: Hello? Who's there?

**[Pithead]**

CONTROL [OC]: No permission is granted for the guard to go on forbidden
ground. Repeat, no permission. They are not to cover the exit to the old
shaft. This is in use at this moment by Control. No one is to go in or near
the old shaft. Top priority.  
DOCTOR: They seem very emphatic about that.  
OFFICIA: Control knows best.  
DOCTOR: But what if your prisoner escapes that way? What will happen to you?  
OFFICIA: I shall be punished.  
DOCTOR: Well, aren't you going to do something about it?  
OFFICIA: Control knows best.  
DOCTOR: Who has escaped, anyway?  
OFFICIA: We shall soon find out.  
(Officia leaves.)  
BEN: It is Jamie.  
DOCTOR: How do you know that, Ben?  
BEN: I saw him take the keys.  
DOCTOR: And you didn't report it?  
BEN: No.  
DOCTOR: Why not?  
BEN: I don't know. I don't seem to be able to think straight.  
DOCTOR: Ben, you're recovering. I always thought you were a tough customer.
Well done.  
BEN: Control knows best.  
DOCTOR: You don't seem very sure.  
BEN: Jamie took those keys. I must report him.

**[Old shaft]**

(Jamie goes back and finds Medok lying on the ground. Something moves in the
shadows, then Jamie is face to face with a Macra.)

**[Pithead]**

POLLY: Doctor, you know what's happened?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Jamie's got free. By my calculations he's got a very good chance.
Hold that for me, will you?  
POLLY: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: Well, as I understand it, Jamie's in the old shaft.  
POLLY: Yes, that's right.  
DOCTOR: And for reasons of their own, Control don't want anyone there. It's
forbidden territory.  
POLLY: So you think he'll be all right?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. I'll be able to tell you when I've tested this to see
how lethal it is.  
POLLY: But what's that got to do with Jamie?  
DOCTOR: On this planet it's got a lot to do with everybody. There now. Yes.  
POLLY: Oh, Doctor, what on earth are you doing?  
DOCTOR: I'm trying to analyse this gas, and I'm not having very much luck.  
POLLY: Is that the same stuff that we've been pumping out of the pits?  
DOCTOR: Yes. And they go to great efforts to get it. The question is why?  
POLLY: Shh! Somebody's coming.  
DOCTOR: Oh! Mustn't find this.

**[Pilot's office]**

SUNNA: Oh, the Pilot's not here. Let me help you.  
BEN: No.  
SUNNA: Always lend a helping hand. A willing friend makes the task lighter.  
BEN: I'll wait for the Pilot, if I'm going to tell anybody.  
SUNNA: You are, aren't you?  
BEN: I don't know what I'm going to do. I've got these voices in my head.
Sometimes I just think I'm having a bad dream.  
SUNNA: But the voices are here to help us. They are our friends.  
BEN: That's it. What about my friends?

**[Old shaft]**

(The Macra is still. Jamie throws a stone then some salt rock at it. It
doesn't move, then its eyes open.)

**[Pithead]**

OFFICIA: I'll see you're reported for this. If this were not an emergency  
POLLY: The bell's stopped. Why has it stopped?  
OFFICIA: Because, young lady, the emergency's over.  
POLLY: Does that mean he's been caught?  
OFFICIA: It means they're closing in on him.  
(The Macra is staring at Jamie.)

**[Pilot's office]**

PILOT: Thank you. But why didn't you tell this to Officia?  
BEN: You told me to report back to you.  
PILOT: I see. Very well. The stranger who has escaped is in the old shaft.
Control will now give instructions.  
CONTROL [OC]: All guards will leave the area of the old shaft. No one must go
near it, even in search of the stranger. Do not approach its exit or entrance.
Do not go in. Officials are to stand by at the gas centre.  
PILOT: We will obey, Control.

**[Pithead]**

OFFICIA: Gas centre standing by. What transfers do you wish made?  
CONTROL [OC]: Prepare for gas to be diverted into the old shaft. Inspect
connection immediately and report back.  
POLLY: The old shaft. Doctor, that's where Jamie is!  
DOCTOR: They're going to pour this gas in the old shaft. Gas they value above
all else. What do you make of that, Polly?  
POLLY: For goodness sake, Doctor. What are you going on about?  
DOCTOR: Don't you see? Control are not pouring this poisonous gas into the old
shaft to kill Jamie. They've quite another reason.  
POLLY: Doctor, you've got to do something to help him.  
DOCTOR: Before we act, we must think. Now, the Macra that have come to the
surface of this planet have not found sufficient gas in the atmosphere, so
they've had to get somebody to pump it up from down below.  
POLLY: But if it's life and death to them, why do they waste it? Why divert it
into the old shaft?  
DOCTOR: That's obvious, Polly, obvious. Because there's something trapped down
there they wish to keep alive.  
(Jamie backs away from the Macra. It moves slightly towards him.)  OFFICIA:
Officia reporting. All connections have been tested. They are all one hundred
percent serviceable. Transfer of all gases may now be made to the old shaft.  
CONTROL [OC]: Stand by for action.  
MUSIC [OC]: The Colony. The Colony is happy to obey. The Colony is happy to
obey.  
POLLY: We've got to help him.  
DOCTOR: I'm doing my best, Polly. I'm thinking at top speed. There's a pattern
involved here, a combination of pipes. If one were to follow this one  
CONTROL [OC]: Stand by gas, Officia. All flow is to be channelled through
systems seven and eleven.  
DOCTOR: Seven and eleven. Now which are they?  
OFFICIA: All channels are ready.  
CONTROL [OC]: Prepare to turn on at half blast.  
OFFICIA: All ready.  
CONTROL [OC]: Now!  
(The Macra starts to revive as Jamie starts to cough.)  
DOCTOR: Seven and eleven. If that's the system in use, it must go from here
round up to there.  
CONTROL [OC]: Officia is to increase pressure.  
POLLY: Doctor, quickly.  
DOCTOR: Polly, I think I've found the gas flow.  
OFFICIA: The pressure's being increased.  
(The Macra advances on Jamie.)  
CONTROL [OC]: Turn on full pressure now.  
OFFICIA: Full pressure in action!  
(Jamie runs down the old shaft, only to have his way blocked by another
Macra.)

__**Episode Four**__

**[Pithead]**

CONTROL [OC]: Retain full pressure.  
OFFICIA: Full pressure is being maintained on master control. Reserves are
standing by.  
DOCTOR: Let me see, let me see.  
POLLY: Doctor, what could be happening to Jamie now?  
DOCTOR: I hate to think. It won't be anything very pleasant. Polly, go and see
what the first dial on the control desk registers.  
POLLY: Right.  
DOCTOR: Hurry up.  
POLLY: Full pressure.  
DOCTOR: Full pressure. And the other one? Come on.  
POLLY: Zero.  
DOCTOR: Zero. Now I think there's only one thing for it. Plus must be made
minus and minus must be made plus.  
POLLY: What's the matter?  
DOCTOR: The question is, which is plus and which is minus?  
POLLY: Oh.  
(Jamie is trapped between two Macra. Jamie spots a crevice in the rock face
and hides in there. In the pithead, the Doctor is tapping pipes.)  
OFFICIA: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Oh, just checking.  
OFFICIA: Well, I don't need your help, thank you.  
DOCTOR: As you please. But I think you're going to run into trouble.  
OFFICIA: Why? What's the matter?  
DOCTOR: Well, according to my calculations, the pressure gauges are wrong.  
OFFICIA: Don't be ridiculous.  
DOCTOR: Ridiculous? Well, that's as may be. But, after all, three times three
is nine, and if you divide by half of its own cubic capacity to the formula Pi
over four squared, I think you'll have to agree with me.  
OFFICIA: Don't touch that.  
DOCTOR: Why not?  
OFFICIA: That controls the inflow system.  
DOCTOR: Oh. So these are the inflow pipes, are they? That's all I wanted to
know.  
OFFICIA: But what are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Inflow. Inflow. Outflow. Inflow. High pressure. Low pressure and O-U-T
spells out.  
POLLY: Doctor, what are you doing?  
DOCTOR: It's all right, Polly, confusion is best left to the experts.  
OFFICIA: But stop it. You've no idea what you're doing.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I have. I can stand an operation on its head quicker than
anyone. There! I think you'll find I've revolutionised the entire gas flow of
the Colony.  
OFFICIA: You must be mad. You'll be locked up.  
DOCTOR: Polly, see what those dials register now.  
POLLY: Right. Doctor, something's happened to this one.  
DOCTOR: What does it read?  
POLLY: It's reads zero.  
DOCTOR: And the other one?  
POLLY: Full pressure.  
DOCTOR: Good. Splendid. That means there'll be a fine old gale of fresh air
blowing along the old shaft any time now.  
(The Macra are trying to prise Jamie from his hiding place, and despite his
best efforts they succeed. He is engulfed by a landslide of salt rock.)  
OFFICIA: You can do nothing. You'll only delay matters. It's a simple matter
for me to reconnect the gas.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure it is. But I'm sure you'd like a little help.  
OFFICIA: Now stop that. You've enough to answer for already. Guard! Guard!  
DOCTOR: It's all right, Polly, I've got his keys. Lock the door.  
OFFICIA: Send the guard, immediately!  
POLLY: They're bound to get in sooner or later.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the later the better. The only thing we can do for Jamie
now is to give him time. Lock the door.  
(Jamie struggles free from the salt rock and fights the Macra. As the fresh
air fills the shaft, both Macra start to slump.)  
CONTROL [OC]: This is Control. Why has the outflow of gas stopped? Gas must be
pumped into the old shaft without interruption. Begin pumping immediately.  
OFFICIA: I need help immediately. The strangers obey nothing. They are turning
taps in the wrong direction.  
CONTROL [OC]: Guards have been detailed to assist you.  
OLA [OC]: Open up in there!  
OFFICIA: The keys. My keys. Where are my keys?  
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Your keys. Try in your pocket. Or on the gantry. Or over
there.  
OFFICIA: Look, I know you've got them.  
POLLY: Doctor, the door.  
OLA [OC]: Open up in there or we'll smash it in.  
POLLY: It's going to give way.  
DOCTOR: Come on, Polly. Let's get out of here.  
POLLY: No, not that way. It goes to the pits. Quick. Try that one.  
DOCTOR: It's locked.  
POLLY: Then use the keys! Quick, Doctor, quick!  
(The guards burst through the doors.)  
OFFICIA: Over there. Quick! Stop them before they do any damage. OLA: Get
them!  
(The guards hurry to the metal door and try to stop it closing.)

**[Pipe room]**

DOCTOR: Push, Polly, push!  
POLLY: I can't!  
DOCTOR: You've got to. Come on, together. I've nearly got it locked. There we
are.  
POLLY: Where are we?  
DOCTOR: Well, it looks rather like a cupboard with a lot of pipes.  
POLLY: Where do you suppose they lead?  
DOCTOR: They must lead somewhere. Let's have a look.  
POLLY: Doctor, I think these are the pipes that carry the poisonous gas.  
DOCTOR: Yes, very likely.  
POLLY: Well, don't you think we'd better stay here?  
DOCTOR: Stay here? I'm not spending the rest of my life with a lot of old
pipes.  
POLLY: But Doctor  
DOCTOR: Now, come along Polly. I'm sure there's no need to be afraid. Well,
well I think there's no need to be afraid. Oh, come on. Let's find out.

**[Pithead]**

OFFICIA: There, that ought to do it. Let's hope we're not too late.

**[Old shaft]**

(Jamie examines the walls for a way out. He forces open a rusty grating, and
crawls through.)

**[Cupboard]**

(Jamie falls into a large cupboard. He can hear voices in the hall next door.)  
LEADER [OC]: What do you know?  
CHEERLEADERS [OC]: We all know Control is right, and we must obey!

**[Hall]**

LEADER: Let them know. Let them know.  
CHEERLEADERS: Let them know they're happy!  
LEADER: Greet the morning with a shout.  
CHEERLEADERS: Everyone up. The sun is out.  
LEADER: Rah, rah, rah!  
CHEERLEADERS: Rah, rah, rah! Cheers for the Colony. We're the gang that works
the hardest, and we must obey. Obey Control. Ring the bell.  
LEADER: Rah, rah, rah!  
CHEERLEADERS: Rah, rah, rah!  
LEADER: Work well.  
CHEERLEADERS: Ring the bell!  
LEADER: Oh, that's much better. But we'll do it again, and this time with more
feeling. Ah! And don't forget our job is to inspire the others. Our brave
workers who are doing such a dangerous job. All right?  
CHEERLEADERS: All right!  
LEADER: What do you know?  
CHEERLEADERS: We all know Control is right, and we must obey!  
LEADER: Let them know. Let them know.  
CHEERLEADERS: Let them know they're happy!  
LEADER: Greet the morning with a shout.  
CHEERLEADERS: Everyone up. The sun is out.  
LEADER: Rah, rah, rah!  
CHEERLEADERS: Rah, rah, rah!  
LEADER: Oh, that's very good! That's beginning to sound like something. It
still needs a bit more clarity, and I think that the girls could. Say! how did
you get there?  
JAMIE: Oh, well, er, I just, as a matter of fact  
LEADER: Oh, I see. You're one of the dancers.  
JAMIE: One of the dancers? Oh, I'm afraid. Aye. Aye, yes. I'm one of the
dancers.  
LEADER: And you got your dance ready?  
JAMIE: My dance? Ah. Well, er, yes. Yes, it's ready.  
LEADER: Well, go ahead. I'll see it now.  
JAMIE: You'll see it now?  
LEADER: And don't forget you have to be very good to get into the Happy Colony
finals. We want something gay and cheerful.  
JAMIE: Gay and cheerful?  
LEADER: Have you any music?  
JAMIE: Oh, no. I don't need it.  
LEADER: Go ahead. We'll pick up the rhythm and clap to it. All right?  
CHEERLEADERS: All right!  
LEADER: Well, come on. Get on with it. We haven't got all day.  
JAMIE: Oh, aye.  
(Jamie starts dancing. The others clap in time to his steps.)  
LEADER: That's very good. What do you call it?  
JAMIE: The Highland Fling.  
LEADER: Why do you call it the Highland Fling?  
JAMIE: Because we finish the dance by flinging ourselves out the door.  
LEADER: Oh, that's very good! Come on now. Rah, rah, rah!  
CHEERLEADERS: Rah, rah, rah!  
LEADER: Cheers for the Colony. Rah, rah, rah!

**[outside the Hall]**

(Jamie has flung himself out the door and into the guards.)  
OLA: Where did this boy come from?  
LEADER: Oh, he's one of the dancers.  
OLA: Nonsense. He's the escaped stranger. You there, identify him. Is this the
boy you reported?  
BEN: (hesitant) Yes.  
JAMIE: Ben, you gave me away.  
OLA: Tie him up. Go to the Pilot. Tell him the stranger's found. Tell him it
won't be long before we get our hands on his friends as well.  
BEN: Jamie, I'm

**[Pipe room]**

CONTROL [OC]: No permission for the guards to go on forbidden ground. Repeat,
no permission. They are not to cover the exit to the old shaft. This is in use
at this moment by Control. No one is to go near the old shaft.  
DOCTOR: Shh. I hear voices. Very faint.  
POLLY: I don't hear anything.  
DOCTOR: Stay here a minute, Polly.  
POLLY: No, don't leave me.  
CONTROL [OC]: The search for the other strangers must be carried on.  
POLLY: It's the Controller. The voice behind the screen.  
CONTROL [OC]: All guards are detailed to hunt for the Doctor and the girl.
They must be taken dead or alive.  
POLLY: Look! He must be there.  
(The Doctor and Polly climb a ladder towards a port hole. They see a Macra
inhaling the gas.)

**[Control room]**

(The Doctor and Polly are looking in.)  
CONTROL: This is Control. The day shift is to begin work in the emergency gas
shaft. All pressures are to be maintained. The Colony cannot live without gas.

**[Pipe room]**

POLLY: So that's where all the gas goes.  
DOCTOR: Yes, just as I thought. These creatures would die without it.  
POLLY: But how long have they been there? I mean, they weren't always in
control, were they?  
DOCTOR: I couldn't tell you when they were here in the first place, Polly.
They're like germs in the human body. They've got into the body of this
colony. They're living as parasites.  
POLLY: You make it sound like a disease.  
DOCTOR: Polly, that's what I think they are.  
POLLY: They're in the control room. It must be like getting into the brain,
mustn't it?  
DOCTOR: Yes, very likely.  
POLLY: Shh. They might hear you.  
DOCTOR: Now then. One system must provide them with the gas they need, and the
other one must be an outflow.  
POLLY: Doctor, we've got to bring the Pilot here, and then we can show him
these creatures really do exist.  
DOCTOR: Yes, Polly. I think it might work.

**[Pilot's office]**

OLA: (to Jamie) Look at me when I talk to you.  
PILOT: Ola, a word with you. Where exactly did you catch him?  
OLA: In here. In the hall, Pilot.  
PILOT: I see. So in fact, he gave himself up?  
OLA: He should never have been allowed to escape.  
PILOT: Are you criticising Control?  
OLA: I'm criticising the running of the pits.  
PILOT: But that is my job, Ola.  
OLA: I know that. But were it not for my guards, this stranger would still be
a danger to all of us. I am going to report to Control that there is no
discipline in the pits.  
PILOT: That's not the only report Control will get!  
OLA: Ever since these strangers arrived your authority in this Colony has gone
to pieces. They come and go as they please, and even now two of them are still
missing.  
DOCTOR: Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Well, everyone is up bright
and early. And the last two strangers are not missing after all. Oh, come now.
We can't have bad temper and differences of opinion in this happy type colony.
Say you're sorry, Ola. Say you're sorry, Pilot.  
JAMIE: Doctor, what did ye come here for? You've walked into a trap.  
DOCTOR: Good morning, Jamie. It's nice to see you so well cared for.  
JAMIE: Yes, but Doctor  
DOCTOR: Oh, it's all right. I've just come in to have a word with my old
friend, the Pilot. Good morning, Ben. I hope you're feeling more your old
self?  
BEN: Yes, Doctor. I am.  
PILOT: Why did not your guards arrest these strangers?  
OLA: I don't know. Guards, arrest them.  
PILOT: That is no longer necessary.  
DOCTOR: Of course not. You can't arrest us now we've given ourselves up.
That's against the rules.  
PILOT: Now. You wish to see me?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I do, urgently. Come with me.  
CONTROL [OC]: This is Control. Everyone is to return to work immediately. This
order includes all executives. It includes the Pilot. Everyone back to work
immediately.  
PILOT: Well, I shall have to go.  
POLLY: No, wait. You must listen to what the Doctor's got to tell you. They're
only saying that because they know what we've seen.  
CONTROL [OC]: At once!  
DOCTOR: Pilot.  
CONTROL [OC]: At once! That is an order!  
POLLY: Don't take any notice of them. That's not your Controller. Those are
your enemies.  
CONTROL [OC]: There must be no discussion with the strangers!  
POLLY: Why not?  
JAMIE: Aye, what are you afraid of?  
CONTROL [OC]: Arrest the strangers! That is an order! All the strangers!  
BEN: That doesn't sound like a man in control.  
PILOT: What did you wish to tell me?  
OLA: Pilot, you heard Control. Guards, take them all away.  
PILOT: I am still the Pilot here. You will take your orders from me. Get back
to your quarters.  
OLA: Contact Control immediately. Report the Pilot!  
DOCTOR: That was a very brave thing to do.  
PILOT: Or very foolish. What is it you wanted to tell me?  
DOCTOR: Come with me.  
OLA: Pilot!  
PILOT: You will all remain here.  
BEN: He disobeyed Control. The Pilot will be arrested.  
JAMIE: No.  
POLLY: Anything may happen now, Jamie. We've got to be ready to run for it.  
JAMIE: We can't leave the Doctor.  
POLLY: He'll be back in a minute, and Ben seems to be all right now.  
JAMIE: Aye, more like the old Ben, I must admit. But you still canna. Where is
he?

**[Pithead]**

(Ben is hiding amongst the instruments, watching the Doctor and Pilot.) PILOT:
But, Doctor, this is forbidden territory.  
DOCTOR: Yes and you'll soon see why.  
PILOT: Stop! Stop! You're breaking the law!  
DOCTOR: Bad laws were made to be broken. Follow me.  
PILOT: But  
(The Doctor and Pilot go into the Pipe room)  
OFFICIA: What's happened to the Pilot, Ola? The strangers have changed him!  
OLA: The Pilot is a traitor.  
CONTROL [OC]: The Pilot has no more authority. Ola is in command!

**[Pipe room]**

PILOT: I really don't know why I trust you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oh, perhaps I've got an honest face.  
CONTROL [OC]: The Pilot is to be arrested! This is a happy Colony! All must
obey!  
PILOT: Did you hear that?  
DOCTOR: Don't give up now. It's just up here.  
(The Doctor and Pilot climb the ladder.)  
CONTROL [OC]: All guards to report to the pit head. They are to take orders
from Ola. Is this understood?  
(The Doctor and Pilot look through the port hole into the Control room full of
Macra.)  
DOCTOR: There you are. That's what's taken over this Colony. You haven't been
in touch with Control, but with these. They've used this Colony for their own
ends, destroying you to live themselves.  
PILOT: Why, they're horrible. No, Doctor. It is they who must be destroyed. We
must kill them.  
CONTROL [OC]: They're here!  
DOCTOR: Let's go.  
CONTROL [OC]: The Pilot and the stranger! In forbidden territory! They must be
destroyed!  
PILOT: What are they, Doctor? I mean, some monstrous form of bacteria?
Insects? Or what?  
DOCTOR: I don't know, but you must fight them.  
PILOT: How?  
DOCTOR: Take full command!  
PILOT: You mean defy Control?  
DOCTOR: Well, you see what Control really is.  
PILOT: Yes. You're right, Doctor. They must be destroyed.

**[Pithead]**

OLA: We've been waiting for you.  
PILOT: Ola, the Colony is in the hands of grotesque insects!  
OLA: So you've been seeing things?  
PILOT: They're in there. The Macra!  
OLA: You know what happens to people that say that.  
PILOT: But I  
OLA: Now we can deal with you all together.  
POLLY: Did the Pilot has see them?  
PILOT: Yes, I saw the Macra.  
CONTROL [OC]: It is forbidden to say that. Don't let him say that he has seen
Macra!  
PILOT: I saw you! You are the Macra!  
CONTROL [OC]: Silence! Silence the three strangers! That is an order!  
OLA: What shall we do with them, Control?  
CONTROL [OC]: Return them to the pipe room. The three strangers and the Pilot.
They are to be locked in, and you will not let them out.  
OLA: Come on, get in.  
PILOT: Ola.  
POLLY: Doctor!  
OLA: Come on, you heard Control. Get in.  
PILOT: You'll suffer for this, you wait and see.  
JAMIE: Don't worry Polly, I'll look after you.  
POLLY: No!  
JAMIE: Take your hands off her.  
OLA: Get in!  
(The Doctor, Polly, Jamie, and the Pilot are locked in the pipe room.)  
CONTROL [OC]: You have done well, Ola.  
OLA: What instructions, Control?  
CONTROL [OC]: Clear the building. Guards and workers are to return to the hall
for music.  
OLA: I obey, Control.  
CONTROL [OC]: It will take precisely four minutes, and then it will be safe
for everyone to return to work. Four minutes.

**[Pipe room]**

POLLY: Why four minutes?  
JAMIE: Aye, what can they do in four minutes, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. We must be ready for anything.  
JAMIE: It's the gas! It's coming in here.  
DOCTOR: Pilot, do you know where it's coming from?  
PILOT: Why, no. I've never been here before.  
DOCTOR: There must be a hidden inlet.  
CONTROL [OC]: You will not be able to fight it. You cannot stop it.  
POLLY: Doctor, I'm getting dizzy.  
DOCTOR: Polly, hold that in front of your mouth.  
JAMIE: It's coming from over here, Doctor!  
DOCTOR: I think you're right, Jamie.  
PILOT: It's coming from here as well!  
CONTROL [OC]: You are unable to stop it.  
DOCTOR: Polly!  
CONTROL [OC]: It will not last long. Only for four minutes. By that time you  
POLLY: Let us out. Let us out!  
CONTROL: Will be completely helpless. Not quite dead, but helpless.

**[Pithead]**

(Ben knocks on the door.)  
BEN: Hello in there.  
POLLY [OC]: Who is it?  
BEN: Ben.

**[Pipe room]**

DOCTOR: Ben? Is that you? Are you all right?  
BEN [OC]: Can you open the door from your side?  
DOCTOR: No.

**[Pithead]**

BEN: But it's locked. There isn't a key.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Ben, listen.

**[Pipe room]**

DOCTOR: We've got very little time. It's all up to you.  
BEN [OC]: Go ahead Doctor. Tell me what to do.  
DOCTOR: Go to the control desk, and you'll see two switches, one marked
outflow and one marked inflow.

**[Pithead]**

BEN: Hang on.  
CONTROL [OC]: The other stranger has recovered. He is now dangerous! He will
no longer obey Control. The fourth stranger is trying to help his friends. He
is no longer one of us. He must be stopped at once!  
BEN [OC]: I've got them, Doc. Two switches. What next?

**[Pipe room]**

DOCTOR: Good. You see a lever in front of them?  
BEN: Yeah.  
CONTROL [OC]: It is forbidden to touch that instrument! You must not obey the
Doctor! You will kill us all! He intends to create an explosion!

**[Pithead]**

CONTROL [OC]: Come away from those instruments! You will destroy the Colony!  
BEN: Oh, shut up. Okay, Doctor. Fire away.  
CONTROL [OC]: Guards! Stop the strangers!

**[Pipe room]**

DOCTOR: Switch on both inflow and outflow.  
CONTROL [OC]: No! Stop! The pressure will be unbearable! Oh, for human beings
as well.  
DOCTOR: Switch them on, Ben. Then stand by to throw the lever.  
CONTROL [OC]: You are to give no such order!  

**[Pithead]**

BEN: Inflow on. Outflow on. Okay, Doc. Ready with the lever.  
(There is hammering on the main door.)  
BEN: Quickly, Doctor!

**[Pipe room]**

DOCTOR: Throw the lever away from you.  
CONTROL [OC]: No! No! Don't let him.  

**[Pithead]**

(There are sounds of explosions.)  
CONTROL [OC]: No!

**[Hall]**

(There is music and dancing. Jamie does his Highland Fling to the delight of
the colonists.)  
PILOT: Now, my first duty is to thank the strangers, for they have saved our
Colony.  
(The colonists cheer.)  
PILOT: A dance festival will be held every year in their memory, and the
winners will be awarded the Strangers' Trophy.  
BEN: Where's the Doctor?  
JAMIE: Why, he's right over there.  
BEN: Well, I've got a tipoff he'll want to hear. Hey, Doctor? Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Relax. Relax. More haste, more waste. Pleasure is beautiful.  
BEN: Relax? You wait till you hear what they're going to do with you.  
DOCTOR: Oh, well.  
BEN: Yeah, I just heard it on the grapevine. They're going to draft us as
members of the Colony, and make you the next Pilot.  
DOCTOR: They can't do that to me. Let's get out of here.  
BEN: Yes, but how?  
DOCTOR: Take a leaf out of Jamie's book. Give them the old dance routine.  
(The Doctor, Polly, Jamie and Ben dance enthusiastically, slowly moving closer
to the door.)
