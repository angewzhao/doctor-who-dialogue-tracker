Original Airdate: 2 Nov, 1968  

__**Episode One**__

**[Tardis]**

(The Tardis has reassembled itself and everyone is on board.)  
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, it's all right. It worked.  
DOCTOR: Jamie! You're right! We'd better just check, though.  
ZOE: Are we actually on our way, Doctor, or are we stuck somewhere?  
DOCTOR: Well, let's see shall we?  
(The Doctor switches on the scanner to show a cratered body in the foreground
and a blue and white planet further away.)  
JAMIE: Where are we? What's that?  
ZOE: It's the moon, isn't it, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. That's the dark side of the moon. We seem to have stopped in
space.  
ZOE: I remember seeing this before.  
DOCTOR: Shush, Zoe. That light on the Moon's surface. Do you see it?  
ZOE: Doctor! It's getting bigger! It's coming towards us!  
DOCTOR: Zoe, that's a missile!  
JAMIE: A what?  
ZOE: It's a missile? Somebody's fired a missile at us, Jamie! Oh Doctor, come
on, let's get out of here.  
DOCTOR: Now don't fuss me, Zoe.  
ZOE: Well, what's happened?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's the landing circuit. It seems to have jammed. That's why
we're stuck in space. Ah.  
(The Doctor pulls a lever off and thumps the console with it.)  
ZOE: We'll never make it! Oh, we're too late!  
DOCTOR: Oh, the stupid thing! Oh!  
(KaBOOM. The Tardis has vanished and something else flies away from where it
was. In a peaceful pasture, a cow looks up as a disembodied blue flashing
light appears above the ground, followed by a police box. In the Tardis,
everyone gets up from the floor.)  
JAMIE: I think we've landed.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sorry about that, Jamie. Are you all right, Zoe?  
ZOE: Yes, I think so.  
JAMIE: Anyway, we weren't blown to pieces by that missile thing.  
ZOE: Why would anybody want to fire a missile at us? Surely they'd find out
who we were first?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Unless they knew already.  
ZOE: The question is, was the object we saw on the other side of the moon in
this time zone or not?  
JAMIE: You mean it could still be out there?  
DOCTOR: Yes, let's have a look.  
(The scanner shows a curious cow. They all laugh.)  
DOCTOR: We're certainly not on the moon's surface, are we.  
JAMIE: What's the matter with the Tardis, Doctor? It keeps going wrong all the
time.  
DOCTOR: It merely needs an overhaul, Jamie, just like any piece of machinery.  
ZOE: Well, haven't you got any spares?  
DOCTOR: No, no. We shall have to see if we can get some made. Lets have a
further look, shall we?  
(An electricity pylon.)  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, it could be twentieth century. England in summertime, I should
say. See the rain clouds? We might try and look up our old friend Professor
Travers in London. He might be able to help us.  
JAMIE: Aye.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Always supposing he's not a baby or a schoolboy. Now, come along.
Let's just collect this circuit, and I think I'd better see this one. There.
It's all right. It's just a fault in the visual stabiliser circuit. We'd
better take that too.  
(The Tardis vanishes.)  
JAMIE: Doctor? Doctor? Where are you?  
DOCTOR: Come along, take my hand.

**[Road]**

(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe come out of the invisible Tardis and walk across
the field to the road. I hope everyone remembers where they parked. A military
style lorry comes along and the Doctor waves it down.)  
DOCTOR: I wonder if you could help us?  
MAN: Are you trying to get out?  
DOCTOR: We're trying to get to London.  
MAN: Get in.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's very civil of you.  
MAN: Well shut up, will you, and get in.  
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie climb into the back of the lorry. It drives off and
two motorcycles follow. The driver sees them and after a short while has to
pull over. He opens the tailgate.)  
DOCTOR: Is something wrong?  
MAN: Look, we'd better get clear of the lorry. Come on.

**[Roadside]**

(They hide in a small wood by the road.)  
JAMIE: What's happening? Why are we hiding?  
MAN: Company security were on my trail.  
ZOE: Which company?  
MAN: Come on, there's only one company.  
DOCTOR: Well, you see, we're strangers around here.  
MAN: Strangers? Then you're not from the community, then?  
DOCTOR: No.  
MAN: Then how did you get inside the compound?  
DOCTOR: Well, that's rather a long story. You see  
ZOE: This community you talked about, are they prisoners here then?  
MAN: Those who haven't gone over to the company are, yes. Not that they say
you can't get out. They just make it pretty impossible without passes.  
JAMIE: You can move in and out.  
MAN: I got in all right. But getting out might be just a bit more difficult.  
DOCTOR: This company, what do they do?  
MAN: International Electromatics. Now surely you've heard of them?  
DOCTOR: Well, no, we've been a little out of touch.  
MAN: You must have been. They're the worlds biggest electronics manufacturers.
You can hardly buy a piece of equipment that isn't theirs. Quick, get down.  
(Two motorcycles roar past.)  
ZOE: Well, what is this place, this compound?  
MAN: They set up a whole community of their own. Factories. Houses. A vast
network of industrial complexes. All of the local people have been bought out.
Most of them join the company. The others  
ZOE: What about them?  
MAN: My people haven't been able to trace them.  
DOCTOR: Your people?  
MAN: Should be safe now. We're not far from the guard post. You three had
better stay out of sight in the lorry. I'll try and bluff our way out. Come
on.

**[Lorry]**

(They come up to a gate in high chainlink fence topped with barbed wire,
manned by uniformed armed guards.)  
JAMIE: We're slowing down. Must be the guard post now.  
ZOE: Yes, but why are we hiding like this? We've done nothing wrong.  
DOCTOR: We'll find out later. Keep down.  
(One guard checks the man's pass while another walks round the lorry. The man
is allowed to drive on. Shortly afterwards, the motorcycle riders arrive.)

**[Road]**

(The lorry stops and the man opens the tailgate.)  
MAN: They're right behind us.  
DOCTOR: Oh, well, thank you very much.  
MAN: They're there in the distance. Now come on, get lost!  
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie go behind the hedge and leave. The motorcycles pull
up. The riders are wearing the same uniforms as the guards at the gate.)  
BIKER: Hey, you. I want to see your pass. You will come back with us for
questioning.  
MAN: Oh come off it. That pass is in order, isn't it?  
BIKER: Don't argue! Follow us.  
MAN: Oh, no, I'm not going back inside that compound, and there's nothing you
can do to make me.  
BIKER: You will come back with us.  
MAN: Look we're not on IE property now, you've no authority.  
(The bikers aim their pistols at him.)  
MAN: Sorry. You want to hold me, get onto the police. See you.  
(The bikers shoot the man. A little way away, the Doctor flags down a car.)  
DOCTOR: Can you give us a lift to London?  
CAMFIELD: Yes, I suppose so.  
(This is the director, Douglas Camfield.)  
DOCTOR: In you get.  
CAMFIELD: All right?  
(Zoe and Jamie get in the back, while the Doctor takes the passenger seat.)  
JAMIE: Thank you. Thank you very much.  

**[Outside Travers' house]**

(The Doctor goes up the steps to the front door of number 18, St James'
Gardens.)  
DOCTOR: Here we are. Right. That's odd. It says Watkins.  
JAMIE: Must have the wrong house.  
DOCTOR: Well, the telephone directory definitely said number eighteen. We'll
ask.  
(The Doctor rings the bell labelled Watkins several times, until the occupant,
a young woman gets fed up and answers it.)  
ISOBEL: If you don't mind, I'm trying to work!

**[Lounge]**

DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry miss, but we wondered whether you could help us? We
wondered if  
(Isobel takes a camera off its tripod.)  
ISOBEL: Oh look, the stupid thing's gone and jammed.  
DOCTOR: Oh dear. Perhaps I could help you.  
ISOBEL: Well, do you know anything about cameras?  
DOCTOR: Yes, a little. I see  
ISOBEL: Now, I had it on automatic shutter.  
DOCTOR: You're taking photos of yourself?  
ISOBEL: Yes, and then you interrupted me and the stupid thing jammed! Have you
come to see my uncle? He's not here. But who are you? Friends of his? Fellow
nuts?  
DOCTOR: Please let me answer one question at a time.  
ISOBEL: Hey, you be careful of that thing. It cost me a fortune.  
DOCTOR: It's all right, it's a very simple mechanism. Who is your uncle?  
ISOBEL: Professor Watkins.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Then Professor Travers doesn't live here?  
ISOBEL: Well, he did. He left about a month ago. Gone to America for a year
with his daughter.  
JAMIE: Oh, that's just great.  
ISOBEL: My uncle worked at the Cavendish labs. He wanted to do some work so
Professor Travers said he could use his daughter's lab here. And I moved in
because I got kicked out of my studio last week.  
DOCTOR: What field of science is your uncle in?  
ISOBEL: Oh, I don't know. He's in applied physics or something. Always messing
around with computers and things. Complete nuts.  
DOCTOR: Well that is fortunate. Perhaps he might be able to help us. Is he at
home?  
ISOBEL: No.  
DOCTOR: Well, where is he?  
ISOBEL: Well, how do I know? I'm not his keeper. Hey, have you fixed it?  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, that's all right.  
ISOBEL: That's really great. Thanks!  
DOCTOR: Miss.  
ISOBEL: (to Zoe) Hey! That's a jolly outfit. (the glitter catsuit) Would you
mind posing for me?  
ZOE: What?  
ISOBEL: Look, just stand there.  
DOCTOR: Miss?  
ISOBEL: Isobel. Yeah. Now, just stand here. Head over the shoulder.  
DOCTOR: Have you any idea when your uncle is going to be back?  
ISOBEL: No, he left about a week ago, I haven't seen him since.  
JAMIE: A week?  
ISOBEL: Yeah, he was prattling on about some new invention, or something or
other, and having the chance to develop it. Now. Not you.  
JAMIE: Oh.  
ISOBEL: Okay now, just  
DOCTOR: Can't you get in touch with him?  
ISOBEL: No, I tried. I wanted to borrow a couple of quid off him in a hurry,
but well, they said he wasn't available for phone calls.  
DOCTOR: They? Now who is they?  
ISOBEL: Just get that, will you? I don't know. International Electric
something or other.  
ZOE: International Electromatics?  
ISOBEL: Yes, probably.  
DOCTOR: You mean your uncle has gone to work for these people? Well, surely we
can get in touch with him.  
ISOBEL: Well, you can try telephoning but I doubt if you'll get any joy.
Phone's in the hall and the number's scribbled on the wall.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
(The Doctor and Jamie leave.)  
ISOBEL: Hey. Don't go. I don't often get the chance of photographing a real
model.  
ZOE: Oh, all right.  
ISOBEL: Come on. Let's get you fixed up with some gear.

**[Hallway]**

(Jamie reads the number off the wall as the Doctor dials.)  
JAMIE: Three.  
DOCTOR: Three.  
JAMIE: Four.  
DOCTOR: Four.  
JAMIE: Two.  
DOCTOR: Two.  
JAMIE: Doctor, Do you suppose this firm could be the one that driver was
talking about?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sure of it.  
JAMIE: In that case, Watkins could have been kidnapped!  
DOCTOR: Ah, Jamie. You mustn't let your imagination run away with you. I must
admit, it's a bit strange.  
WOMAN [OC]: International Electromatics company. State your business.  
DOCTOR: I would like, please, to speak with Professor Watkins.  
WOMAN [OC]: One moment. (long pause) Party not available.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, you see, but this is very important.  
WOMAN [OC]: Party not available.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but I must speak with him.  
WOMAN [OC]: Party not available. Party not available.  
DOCTOR: But this is an automatic answering device! Ah, shut up, you stupid
machine!  
(The Doctor puts the phone down.)  
JAMIE: Now what?  
DOCTOR: There's only one thing for it. We'll have to go there ourselves.

**[Lounge]**

(Zoe is wearing a feather boa round her neck and a mini-pinafore dress now.
Isobel is photographing her from below.)  
ISOBEL: Okay, that's fabulous. Just keep it like that. Great.  
(The Doctor and Jamie enter.)  
ISOBEL: Any luck?  
DOCTOR: No, it was stupid simple-minded computer answering service.  
ISOBEL: Well, what do we do now?  
DOCTOR: Jamie and I are going to this place. Come on, Zoe.  
ZOE: No, thanks. I think I'll stay here. It's great fun.  
JAMIE: You look like a chicken with all those feathers on!  
DOCTOR: Oh well, come on, Jamie. Oh, the address?  
ISOBEL: Oh, that's scribbled on the wall too.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.  
JAMIE: Do you not write anything down on paper at all?  
ISOBEL: Well, I'd only lose it if I did. Writing on a wall's much safer. You
can't lose a wall, can you?  
JAMIE: No.  
ISOBEL: Okay, listen. Just put your boa round your head. Okay, now bring your
eyes just into me. Okay.

**[IE Reception]**

(The Doctor and Jamie arrive at a large skyscraper \- Millbank Tower actually
- and enter the deserted reception area. There is one door labelled IE - no
unauthorised entry - so the Doctor goes through. Outside, two men in a car
watch them. The Doctor comes face to face with computer bank complete with
magnetic tape and flashing lights.)  
DOCTOR: I thought so.  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: More stupid computers. Automatic receptionists. Right.  
WOMAN: International Electromatic Company. State your business.  
DOCTOR: I would like, please, to speak with Professor Watkins.  
WOMAN: One moment. Party not available.  
DOCTOR: Then I would like to speak with someone in authority.  
WOMAN: Your request will be considered and your appointment arranged. Please
state your name and address.  
DOCTOR: That's no good. I wish to speak with somebody now.  
WOMAN: I am sorry. All personnel are engaged.  
DOCTOR: But I insist. This is an emergency!  
WOMAN: State the nature of the emergency.  
DOCTOR: It's a private matter.  
WOMAN: Private matters have no emergency status.  
DOCTOR: Oh shut up, you stupid machine! Diabolical inventions.  
JAMIE: What now?  
DOCTOR: Come on.  
JAMIE: Where are we going?  
DOCTOR: Well, there must be somebody else in this building except these stupid
machines. Come on.  
(The Doctor and Jamie go out and down a back alley, watched by security
cameras.)

**[Outside IE]**

(In the car.)  
BENTON: HQ are checking now. Where are they?  
TRACY: Gone round the back, down the side alley.  
BENTON: That's a dead end, isn't it? So they've got to come out this way.  
TRACY: If they come out.

**[Vaughn's office]**

(A silver haired man - Vaughn - is watching the Doctor and Jamie on a
monitor.)  
PACKER: Well?  
VAUGHN: The same two?  
PACKER: Yeah.  
VAUGHN: Deal with them.  
(Packer leaves. Vaughn presses a button as Jamie and the Doctor step out of a
lift. Gas pours out of a nozzle, filling the corridor, and they collapse.)

**[Outside IE]**

(In the car.)  
BENTON: Okay lets move.  
TRACY: HQ?  
BENTON: Yes, they've run a check. They want these two. Priority.  
TRACY: Right, let's get 'em.

**[Corridor]**

(Packer and guards come out of the lift and take hold of the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: Wait!  
PACKER: (raising his fist.) This will be my pleasure.  
VAUGHN [on monitor]: Packer! Bring them to my office.  
PACKER: But Mister Vaughn, I haven't interrogated them yet.  
VAUGHN [on monitor]: Packer, please do as I say.  
PACKER: Yes, sir. Come on. This way.

**[Vaughn's office]**

(Sunlight streams through the vertical blinds.)  
VAUGHN: Come and sit down, gentlemen.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
VAUGHN: You can go, Packer.  
PACKER: But Mister Vaughn, I  
VAUGHN: Thank you, Packer. Thank you.  
PACKER: Yes sir.  
(Packer leaves.)  
VAUGHN: I must apologise for Packer's crude devotion to duty. But your method
of entry into my building was rather unconventional, wasn't it?  
JAMIE: Aye, well, there was no need for all that gas and stuff.  
DOCTOR: Jamie. I think perhaps it is we who should be apologising to you,
Mister  
VAUGHN: Vaughn. Tobias Vaughn. I'm the managing director of International
Electromatics. Your business must be very pressing to force you to such
extremes.  
DOCTOR: Yes, it is.  
VAUGHN: Concerning Professor Watkins?  
JAMIE: How did you know?  
VAUGHN: My computer. It reported directly to me.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I see.  
VAUGHN: You've gone to a lot of trouble for nothing, you know. The Professor's
working on an experiment and refuses to see anyone.  
JAMIE: Ah, well, we only want to talk to him, you see.  
VAUGHN: Perhaps I can help.  
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so, thank you very much.  
JAMIE: Oh, come on Doctor. It's only a couple of electronic circuits.  
(The Doctor kicks Jamie on the ankle.)  
VAUGHN: Circuits? Electronic circuits? My technicians are the best in the
world. I'm sure they'd be able to assist you. Show me the circuits.  
DOCTOR: Well, I  
VAUGHN: Please, I'd like to help.  
(The Doctor hands Vaughn the Tardis circuits.)  
VAUGHN: As you say, rather complex. However, I'm sure we'll be able to help
you.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I.  
VAUGHN: I'll have them sent to my workshops immediately.  
DOCTOR: Oh, how very kind.  
VAUGHN: Not at all. Professor Watkins is a valued colleague. Any friend of his
is.  
(Vaughn puts the circuits in a drawer, next to a pistol.)  
VAUGHN: Oh, have you got one of these, young man?  
JAMIE: No. What is it?  
VAUGHN: Surely you've seen them about. They're disposable transistor radios.
One of our latest products. Most popular. We've sold ten million in this
country alone. Here. Compensation for the treatment you received from the
worthy Packer.  
JAMIE: Thank you. How does it work?  
(Jamie presses the only button and loud music plays. The Doctor switches it
off again.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's how you turn it off, Jamie.  
VAUGHN: Now if you'll excuse me, I'm afraid I have an urgent appointment.  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Come along, Jamie.  
VAUGHN: Packer will meet you and show you the way out, Mister?  
DOCTOR: Doctor. Goodbye.  
VAUGHN: Goodbye, Doctor.  
JAMIE: Goodbye, Mister Vaughn. Thank you for the radio.  
VAUGHN: Not at all.  
(The Doctor and Jamie leave. Vaughn looks closely at one of the circuits then
activates his intercom.)  
VAUGHN: Packer?  
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, Mister Vaughn?  
VAUGHN: Show our visitors off the premises, will you?  
PACKER [on monitor]: Very good, sir.

**[Outside IE]**

PACKER: The next time, read the notice on the door.  
JAMIE: Oh, don't tell me you can read as well. What else do you do!?  
DOCTOR: Jamie!  
(Packer goes back inside.)  
JAMIE: Friendly sort of chap.  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
JAMIE: Is something wrong?  
DOCTOR: Yes. That fellow's not what he seems.  
JAMIE: That big idiot? Oh don't worry. I'll soon sort  
DOCTOR: No, no, no. I mean Vaughn. The normal range of human blinking is about
once every ten or fifteen seconds. Vaughn was blinking far less frequently
than that.  
JAMIE: Oh, and he's got a forked tail and wee horns.  
DOCTOR: Oh I'm not joking, Jamie. Underneath all that charm there was
something odd. Sinister. Almost inhuman.

**[Vaughn's office]**

(Vaughn puts the circuit back in the drawer and flicks a switch. Part of the
back wall off the office opens to reveal a very alien computer, at the centre
of which is an oval cybernetic head.)

__**Episode Two**__

**[Street]**

(Jamie and the Doctor are walking down Walmer Road when the Doctor notices a
Jaguar following them. (460WPE) It is Benton and Tracy. They start to run.)

**[Lounge]**

(Zoe is still wearing the boa and holding a pose as Isobel takes an upward
photograph.)  
ISOBEL: Hold it now. Last one. Okay, you can relax.  
ZOE: Oh good. I didn't know standing still could be so exhausting.  
ISOBEL: Would you like some coffee?  
ZOE: Mmm, please. How long have they been gone?  
ISOBEL: Oh, I don't know. About a couple of hours, I suppose.  
ZOE: I hope they're all right.  
ISOBEL: Oh, of course they are. Probably got themselves lost or something.
What's so important about these, er, circuit things you were telling me about,
anyway?  
ZOE: Well, they were part of the. Well, it's a sort of machine we travel in.  
ISOBEL: Oh. You mean a sort of electric car?  
ZOE: Well, it's a bit more sophisticated than that.  
ISOBEL: Oh, well anyway, I'm hope that you're going to stick around for a bit.
I get sick of photographing myself.  
ZOE: Oh, why don't you always use a model?  
ISOBEL: Can't afford it. I've only just got about enough cash to buy all the
junk I need for the camera. It's an expensive business and, well, I'm not good
enough to be a professional yet.  
ZOE: Well, I think you're very good. These photographs of you are splendid.  
ISOBEL: Yeah. Yeah, they're great but I didn't take them. I was just the
model. That's how I earned the loot to pay for all this.  
ZOE: Oh, I see.  
ISOBEL: You're still worried about your two friends, aren't you?  
ZOE: Yes, a bit.  
ISOBEL: They can't have got themselves into any sort of trouble, can they?  
ZOE: Oh, you wouldn't say that if you knew them. If there's trouble to be
found, the Doctor and Jamie can't miss it.

**[Street]**

(The Doctor and Jamie run down another street to find another Jaguar stopped
in front of them. The men get out as the first car comes round the corner
behind them and Benton and Tracy get out.)  
JAMIE: Well, what do we do now, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Accept the situation, Jamie. There's nothing else we can do.  
(The Doctor sits on the curb and starts dealing out playing cards. The four
men walk up.)

**[Vaughn's office]**

(A boffin is looking at the circuit board.)  
VAUGHN: Well? For a Head Research Assistant, Gregory, I expect a little more
coherent a reply than an enigmatic shake of the head.  
GREGORY: I'm sorry, Mister Vaughn. I've never seen anything like these before.
Given time I might be able  
VAUGHN: Then take time, my dear fellow.  
GREGORY: Right, Mister Vaughn.  
VAUGHN: Take one hour.  
(Gregory leaves. Vaughn uses the intercom.)  
VAUGHN: Packer.  
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, Mister Vaughn?  
VAUGHN: Packer, those two uninvited guests we had this morning. I assume they
were photographed?  
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, sir. Security cameras will have taken visual
recordings, sir.  
VAUGHN: Have some prints taken and sent up to me.

**[Lounge]**

(Isobel is playing a 78 record of 'The Teddy Bear's Picnic' on a phonograph.)  
ISOBEL: Great, isn't it? I got it off a barrow in the Portobello Road.  
ZOE: Oh, yes.  
ISOBEL: What's the matter? Don't you like it?  
ZOE: Oh, yes, it's fine.  
ISOBEL: You're still worried about your two friends, aren't you? Why?  
ZOE: Oh, I don't know. I've just got this feeling that something's happened to
them.  
ISOBEL: Why on earth should it have?  
ZOE: No reason at all, really. It's not a logical conclusion, just intuition.  
ISOBEL: Well, I'll tell you what we'll do then. We'll go right out after them,
okay?  
ZOE: Oh yes, please.  
ISOBEL: We'd better leave a note for them just in case they come back when
we're not here.  
ZOE: Okay.  
ISOBEL: I'll go and get my coat first.

**[Aeroplane]**

(Jaguar drives across RAF Fairford to where a Hercules transport plane is
lowering its access ramp. Military personnel put out a pair of smaller ramps
and it drives straight up and onboard. Jamie and the Doctor walk through a
door in a glass map of the northern hemisphere centred on the North Pole into
an area where military personnel in grey uniforms with UNIT shoulder flashes
are working. Benton and Tracy follow.)  
JAMIE: Would you mind telling us what all this is about?  
BENTON: You'll find out, sir.  
JAMIE: Sir?  
(An officer comes out of a forward compartment.)  
BRIGADIER: All right, Benton, thank you.  
BENTON: Sir.  
TRACY: NAAFI break, sir?  
BRIGADIER: Very well.  
(Benton and Tracy leave.)  
BRIGADIER: How nice to see you again, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: It's Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart!  
BRIGADIER: Ah, Brigadier now. I've gone on up in the world.  
JAMIE: Oh course, the Yetis. We met you in the  
BRIGADIER: That's right, McCrimmon, in the underground. Must be four years ago
now.  
JAMIE: That long. It only seems about a couple of weeks ago, doesn't it.  
DOCTOR: I've told you over and over again, Jamie. Time is relative.  
BRIGADIER: Are you still making a nonsense of it. Doctor, in your, what was it
called? Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Yes, we're still travelling. Yes.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, Mister Travers told me all about it. It's er, well it's, to
say the least, an unbelievable machine.  
DOCTOR: Any more unbelievable than the Yetis?  
BRIGADIER: No, true. I'm not quite so much of a sceptic as I was since that
little escapade.  
DOCTOR: But what's all this, and why all the cloak and dagger stuff to bring
us here?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, I'm sorry about that but my chaps have to be a bit
melodramatic in their methods. But I'll explain. Look, do sit down.  
JAMIE: Thank you.  
DOCTOR: How nice.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, Sergeant Walters!  
WALTERS: Yes sir?  
BRIGADIER: Lay on some tea, will you? You'd like some tea, wouldn't you,
Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Oh thank you, and a patty cake biscuit. Thank you.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, since the Yeti do, I've been in charge of an independent
intelligence group that we call UNIT. That's United Nations Intelligence
Taskforce.  
JAMIE: You mean you're like a world secret police.  
BRIGADIER: Not quite. We don't actually arrest people, just investigate them.  
JAMIE: But what about us? I mean, you arrested us.  
BRIGADIER: Not really. You see, my men were keeping a watch on the
International Electromatic Headquarters when you two showed up. I've been
keeping a check on everyone going in that building. Your photographs were
transmitted to this Headquarters and I recognised you.  
DOCTOR: But what's so odd about people going into the building?  
BRIGADIER: Oh, nothing odd about them going in. The trouble is, some of them
haven't come out.

**[IE Reception]**

ZOE: Looks like a robot reception.  
ISOBEL: Yeah. Yes, This probably the same idiot machine that answers the
telephone when you ring up.  
(Zoe switches it on.)  
WOMAN: International Electromatic Company. State your business.  
ZOE: Enquiry. Reference two persons seeking information concerning the
whereabouts of Professor Watkins.  
WOMAN: Wait please.

**[Vaughn's office]**

(Vaughn looks at photograph E091/5D/78 of the Doctor and Jamie looking up at
the skyscraper, then opens the secret panel.)  
VAUGHN: Has the information been considered?  
PLANNER: The images of the two humans have been analysed and registered. They
are known and are hostile.  
VAUGHN: Hostile? How can that be? Have you been on Earth before?  
PLANNER: No, they have been recognised on Planet Fourteen. They are dangerous
and must be destroyed.  
VAUGHN: Planet Fourteen? But how?  
PLANNER: They must be destroyed.  
VAUGHN: Yes, I'll deal with them.  
PLANNER: Plans for invasion are nearing completion. Nothing must be allowed to
interrupt them.  
VAUGHN: Don't worry. Nothing will.  
PLANNER: Nothing must be allowed to interrupt them.  
(Vaughn closes the secret panel. His intercom beeps and the monitor shows Zoe
with his automated receptionist.)

**[IE Reception]**

ZOE: Now listen to me, you stupid, primitive machine, I asked a perfectly
simple question, and I expect an answer.  
WOMAN: No information available.  
ISOBEL: It's no good Zoe.  
ZOE: I will not be beaten by this brainless tin box.  
ISOBEL: But you can't do anything about it.  
ZOE: Can't I? A little problem in ALGOL, I think.  
ISOBEL: In what?  
ZOE: ALGOL. It's a sort of language you talk to computers in. Now watch.  
(Zoe switches on the machine again.)  
WOMAN: International Electromatic Company. State your business.  
ZOE: Begin. Real X sum positive. Delete square. Begin sum two, subscript J.  
ISOBEL: That's ALGOL?  
ZOE: Integer compute. Printout Y to the minus X variable one. I'm enjoying
this.  
WOMAN: International Electro  
ZOE: Go to finish. Continue. Integrate on iversine.  
(Smoke comes from the magnetic tapes.)  
ISOBEL: It seems to be getting a little bit heated.  
ZOE: You bet. This equation is insoluble.  
ISOBEL: Zoe, I think you ought to stand back.  
(ZOE stands back with ISOBEL and tells the computer.)  
ZOE: Now, continue printout continuous integration.  
(The computer goes Bang. Zoe and Isobel laugh.)

**[Vaughn's office]**

(Vaughn is smiling too.)  
VAUGHN: Packer!  
(PACKER appears on the intercom.)  
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, sir?  
VAUGHN: Reception. Two young girls. Bring them to me.  
PACKER [on monitor]: Right, Mister Vaughn.

**[IE Reception]**

ZOE: It'll take more than a soldering iron to put that right.  
ISOBEL: Hey, don't you think we better get out of here before somebody gets
annoyed?  
ZOE: Oh yes. I think perhaps you're right.  
(Zoe and Isobel are grabbed by black uniformed men at the door.)

**[Aeroplane]**

(There are a series of overhead photographs on the map table.)  
BRIGADIER: This is Gordon Jones, lecturer in physics, Churchill College,
Cambridge. Next one's a chap I knew at Sandhurst, old Billy Rutlidge. He's got
himself a very cushy number at the Ministry of Defence.  
DOCTOR: And all these people went into the building, the IE building, and
didn't come out.  
BRIGADIER: No, no, most of them came out again, but there was something
definitely odd about them when they did.  
DOCTOR: Odd?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, old Billy Rutlidge, for instance. He was quite cooperative
about my investigation into Vaughn initially but after he'd been to the IE
Building he started getting a bit sticky about it.  
JAMIE: Doctor, would you look at that one!  
BRIGADIER: Do you know this man?  
DOCTOR: Jamie, yes.  
JAMIE: Aye, he gave us a lift in his lorry.  
BRIGADIER: When did you last see him?  
JAMIE: This morning.  
BRIGADIER: This man's an agent of ours. His report is almost twelve hours
overdue.  
JAMIE: Ah, well he did say something about some security guards on his tail.  
DOCTOR: I expect that he's all right. He was all right this morning when we
left him. Brigadier, tell me more about this International Electromatics set-
up.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, there isn't much to tell. The head of the group is a man named
Tobias Vaughn.  
JAMIE: Oh yes, we've met him. A nice man. He gave me this.  
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie, don't  
BRIGADIER: Oh yes, that's just the small stuff. They control practically all
of the major computer lines.  
DOCTOR: Put it away.  
BRIGADIER: They made their real breakthrough in micro-monolithic circuit
designs, undercutting practically everyone else in the market.  
DOCTOR: But what's your interest in this?  
BRIGADIER: Well, I knew a little about Vaughn before his sudden success. I put
out a routine check on him and we came up with one or two things of interest.  
JAMIE: Like the disappearance of Professor Watkins.  
BRIGADIER: Yes.  
JAMIE: Ah. See?  
DOCTOR: I see. I don't suppose you have any authority to search the building,
have you?  
BRIGADIER: No. Vaughn's too powerful. He's got too many top people on his
side. You see, Doctor, I daren't make a move against him unless I have good
reason to do so.  
DOCTOR: Well, it looks to me if Jamie and I want to find the Professor, we'll
have to find him in our own way.  
BRIGADIER: That's about the sum of it. However, should you find yourself in
any difficulty. Sergeant Walters!  
WALTERS: Yes, sir? BRIGADIER: Got a TM-45 handy?  
WALTERS: Yes, sir. Right here.  
DOCTOR: Is that a tank?  
BRIGADIER: Oh no, no. My units are on constant alert, so should you find
yourselves in any real trouble, you can just give us a call.  
DOCTOR: Jolly good.  
WALTERS: Here you are, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Thank you, Sergeant.  
BRIGADIER: Now, this is a small transceiver, range of about fifty miles on a
set frequency. Just press this button and ask for me.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, that's splendid. Yes, this should come in very handy.  
BRIGADIER: Call me any time. I'm usually available. Now, I'd better lay on
transport to get you two back to London. **[Outside Travers' house]**

(No answer to the doorbell.)  
JAMIE: No. They must have gone out.  
(But the front door opens as Jamie leans on it.)  
DOCTOR: Zoe? Isobel?

**[Lounge]**

JAMIE: Probably gone for a walk.  
DOCTOR: Look, Jamie, sandwiches. I'm hungry. Want one?  
JAMIE: Thank you. You know, Doctor. That chap, Mister Vaughn, doesn't seem
such a bad man.  
(Jamie turns his radio on.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie. How can I think when you've got that thing on?  
JAMIE: Hey!  
(The Doctor examines the little trannie.) DOCTOR: All right, all right.  
JAMIE: Don't break it.  
DOCTOR: All right! I just want to take a look at it, that's all. Oh, yes. It's
an interesting little piece of  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: Well, well, well. What have we here?  
JAMIE: What do you mean, what have we here?  
DOCTOR: There's a micro-monolithic circuit in the back plate of this radio.  
JAMIE: Well, what's that?  
DOCTOR: It's a very complex circuit in miniature.  
JAMIE: What's so odd about that?  
DOCTOR: It has nothing to do with the radio, as far as I can see.  
JAMIE: Oh Doctor, just put it back together again.  
DOCTOR: All right!  
JAMIE: I don't suppose Zoe would have left a note, do you? No, I can't see
anything. Well you might at least help me look for it.  
DOCTOR: I suggest that we try the wall.  
JAMIE: Eh?

**[Hallway]**

DOCTOR: Isobel never writes anything on paper. You can't lose a wall,
remember. JAMIE: Oh. Ah! Tired of waiting. Gone to IE offices to look for you.
Zoe and Isobel. DOCTOR: Jamie! We'd better go after them.

**[Vaughn's office]**

VAUGHN: You and your friend the Doctor, have caused some considerable trouble
today. First he breaks into this building and then you ruin a very expensive
device.  
ISOBEL: Only because the stupid thing wouldn't tell us what we wanted to know.  
VAUGHN: Ah, yes, Miss Watkins. You're concerned about your uncle, aren't you?  
ISOBEL: I'd like to know where he is, yes.  
VAUGHN: He's perfectly well, I assure you, although a little, er,
uncooperative at the moment. Your visit here is most opportune. I think that
you can be very useful to me.  
ISOBEL: Me? But how?  
VAUGHN: Your uncle needs to be persuaded to continue his work for me.  
ISOBEL: But I can't do anything about that.  
VAUGHN: No, But I can now. Packer, I'd like you to take care of these two
young ladies please.  
PACKER: Take them!  
(Burly guards take Zoe and Isobel out.)

**[Outside the IE building]**

(Jamie starts up the entrance steps but the Doctor beckons him on down the
side of the building.)  
JAMIE: I thought that we were going in there to look for Zoe and Isobel?  
DOCTOR: There's no one in there except that stupid computer, and that's won't
tell us anything.  
JAMIE: But how are we going to find out that they are in there?  
DOCTOR: Well, if the Brigadier's men are still around, they should have seen
them go in. Hello?  
MAN [OC]: UNIT to operations, over.  
DOCTOR: Hello, could I speak to the Brigadier?  
MAN [OC]: Stand by. Out.  
DOCTOR: What a splendid little toy this is, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Aye, but doesn't play tunes like mine.

**[Aeroplane]**

BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor. I've got a report here on two girls. About nineteen or
so. One of them dark, one of them fair. One of them was wearing very distinct
clothes.  
JAMIE [OC]: Zoe! Doctor, that could have been Zoe.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Jamie, just a minute please. Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER: Yes?  
DOCTOR [OC]: These clothes. Did they include a rather brightly-coloured
feather boa?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, the little dark one was wearing that. They friends of yours?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, I'm afraid they are.  
JAMIE [OC]: Doctor, come on, let's get after them.  
DOCTOR [OC]: All right, all right, Jamie. Brigadier, we're going to try to get
into the building and try to find them.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, be careful. You may not be so lucky this time. Call me
if you get into trouble.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Thanks.  
BRIGADIER: Right, over and out.  
TURNER: Is it wise to let them go in alone, sir? I mean, they don't exactly
sound like professionals to me.  
BRIGADIER: Don't underestimate them, Jimmy. They may look like amateurs, but
that man has an incredible knack of being one jump ahead of everyone. If there
is a safe way into that place, he'll be the one to find it.

**[Railway sidings]**

(The Doctor and Jamie follow a railway track in Park Royal - Guinness Brewery
really - and look through the chainlink fence at black uniformed men and
freight carriages.)  
JAMIE: You're right, you know. This does lead into the back of the place.  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Jamie. Come on.  
(They go through the gate into the sidings proper.)

**[Vaughn's office]**

GREGORY: I'm sorry, sir, but these circuits don't make sense. The material
isn't any known metal alloy. In fact, the structure's more that of a plastic.
What's more, the connections seems to be to be completely illogical.  
VAUGHN: Hmm. How very interesting. This strange Doctor intrigues me more and
more.  
GREGORY: I can do some more tests on the circuits if you like, sir, but  
VAUGHN: No, I think I know the answer, Gregory. You can go.  
GREGORY: Yes, sir.  
(Gregory leaves and Vaughn opens the secret panel.)  
VAUGHN: I need more data about this man that you say you recognise, this
Doctor.  
PLANNER: It is enough that you know he is hostile. He must be destroyed.  
VAUGHN: You said you recognised him on Planet Fourteen. How is this possible?  
PLANNER: These questions are unnecessary. He must be destroyed.  
VAUGHN: That is for me to decide.  
PLANNER: You will obey.  
VAUGHN: You forget I control the operation from Earth! Unless that's clearly
understood, our partnership will cease! Tell that to your leader.  
PLANNER: It has been agreed.  
VAUGHN: I felt sure you would be reasonable. Now, you say you recognised this
Doctor on Planet Fourteen. How did he get there?  
PLANNER: He has a machine.  
VAUGHN: What sort of machine?  
PLANNER: We have no more information. But he must be destroyed. The invasion
must succeed.  
VAUGHN: It will. The Doctor will be taken care of. I shall see to that
personally.

**[Warehouse]**

(An eight foot metal container with what looks like a bottle cap on both ends
is carried in and laid on the floor. There are lots more already stacked up.
The Doctor and Jamie are watching from behind a wall.)  
DOCTOR: That's incredible!  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: The ease with which that man carried that crate.  
JAMIE: Probably empty.  
DOCTOR: Let's go and see.  
(But their combined efforts do not move it.)  
JAMIE: That man must be a superman.  
DOCTOR: It's odd, Jamie, it's distinctly odd.  
JAMIE: There's someone coming.  
(They run back behind the wall. The man carries in another container, puts it
down and leaves.)  
JAMIE: It's amazing.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
JAMIE: Come on, let's find Zoe and Isobel and get out of here. These fellows
are giving me the creeps.  
DOCTOR: Yes.

**[Vaughn's office]**

(The intercom is beeping.)  
VAUGHN: Yes?  
PACKER [on monitor: They're back again, Mister Vaughn. The Doctor and the boy.
Security eye has picked them up in the warehouse.  
VAUGHN: That's rather unfortunate for them, isn't it, Packer?  
PACKER [on monitor]: Shall I put a full security alert on, sir? VAUGHN: No,
Packer. We don't want to frighten them off, do we? Just close off the area and
we'll flush them out. Have you dealt with the two young ladies yet?  
PACKER [on monitor]: No, sir. I was about to when this new alert happened.  
VAUGHN: How fortunate. We need a sprat to catch our mackerel. Take them down
to the warehouse area.

**[Warehouse]**

JAMIE: This place is like a maze. Doctor, I think we're lost.  
DOCTOR: There must be a door to the main building somewhere.  
(Screams.)  
JAMIE: Zoe and Isobel! Come on.  
(Two warehousemen in overalls carry the unconscious Zoe and Isobel up to a
container.)  
PACKER: Right. Put them inside.  
(The container lid is shut with a piece of feather boa sticking out.)  
PACKER: Load it onto the return van.  
JAMIE: Come on!  
DOCTOR: No, Jamie. Wait.  
(Jamie tackles Packer from behind.)  
PACKER: Guards! Guards!  
DOCTOR: The guards! Come on.  
(The Doctor and Jamie run round walls, but they are cornered by armed guards
and brought back to Packer, who draws his pistol.)  
PACKER: Like rats in a trap.

__**Episode Three**__

**[Warehouse]**

PACKER: You really don't learn, do you? This is private property. A restricted
area.  
JAMIE: Where's Zoe? Where have you taken her?!  
PACKER: Be quiet!  
JAMIE: Look, we heard them scream. If you've hurt her  
PACKER: I said be quiet!  
(Jamie lunges at Packer and gets thrown off into a wall.)  
VAUGHN: Packer! You really must try and control this violent streak in your
nature, Packer. Although I must admit the situation is provoking.  
So here you are again. You really are beginning to try our patience, you know.  
JAMIE: And he's beginning to try mine.  
DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie. We came here looking for two friends of ours.  
VAUGHN: Two young ladies? Yes.  
JAMIE: So he admits that they're here.  
VAUGHN: Correction. They were. It would seem that you've been chasing each
other's tails. They came here looking for you.  
DOCTOR: Where are they now?  
VAUGHN: Why, they left, of course.  
JAMIE: Aye, carted off by two of your thugs in a box.  
VAUGHN: Oh really.  
JAMIE: Look, it's true. We heard them scream and I saw some of Zoe's clothes
trapped in the lid.  
VAUGHN: You really do have a very fertile imagination, young man.  
JAMIE: Now listen you, I'm telling I definitely saw those  
DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie. It would set our minds at rest if we could take a look
inside those boxes.  
VAUGHN: Then you shall. Packer, I presume the only crates going out of here
are the empty ones being returned to the factory?  
PACKER: Yes, sir. They're loading now, sir.  
VAUGHN: Then you shall inspect them at your leisure. After you.  
DOCTOR: How kind.  
(The Doctor, Jamie and the guards leave. Vaughn gestures to Packer and leaves.
Packer speaks into his wrist communicator.)  
PACKER: This is Packer. Get the return van moving immediately. Do you
understand? I said immediately!

**[Outside the warehouse]**

(The freight train rattles off down the line.)  
VAUGHN: Ah, just too late, I'm afraid. Such a pity. Still, all is not lost. I
am myself going down to the factory today. Would you care to join me? We can
meet the train on its arrival.  
DOCTOR: Well, that's very civil of you.  
VAUGHN: My pleasure.

**[Aeroplane]**

BRIGADIER: How long ago did they go in?  
BENTON [OC]: Some time ago, sir. Tracy followed them as far as the official
boundaries of the railway sidings. They went in about an hour ago.  
BRIGADIER: Is Tracy still round there?  
BENTON [OC]: Yes sir.  
BRIGADIER: Right, stick around for a while.  
BENTON [OC]: Just a minute, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, what is it, Benton?  
BENTON [OC]: The Doctor and the boy. They're coming out, sir, with Vaughn.  
(Jamie gets into the Rolls through the door held open by the chauffeur, then
out the other side and into the passenger seat just before Packer got to it.)  
BRIGADIER: Benton, what's happening? What's happening?  
BENTON [OC]: Oh, sorry, sir. Nothing really, they've all got into Vaughn's
private car. Oh, they're driving off, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Is any force being used?  
BENTON [OC]: No, not that I can see. Packer was there but it looked very
friendly to me. Shall we follow?  
BRIGADIER: No, I'll have them tracked more discretely. Over and out. Sergeant
Walters.  
WALTERS: Yes sir?  
BRIGADIER: Alert all area patrols in section three.  
WALTERS: Yes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Did you hear all that, Jimmy?  
WALTERS: I did, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Look, we'll get you aboard a chopper and you can rendezvous with
the tracking agent.  
WALTERS: All right, sir. Are they any specific instructions?  
BRIGADIER: No, we're playing a bit by ear for the moment, so try and keep out
of trouble. Should the Doctor contract us for help, I'll have his signal
relayed straight to you.  
WALTERS: Right, sir.  
(The Rolls is admitted into the IE compound. The guards look up at the sound
of rotors overhead.)

**[Helicopter]**

TURNER: They've just gone into the IE area, sir. Shall I follow?

**[Aeroplane]**

BRIGADIER: No, circle the area. We can't really do anything until we get a
request from the Doctor.  
TURNER [OC]: Standing by, sir.  
BRIGADIER: And Jimmy? Keep out of sight. If Vaughn's private army see you they
might well get the wind up and that might make things rather unhealthy for the
Doctor and the boy. Over and out.

**[Lift]**

(The guards present arms to Vaughn when they arrive at the building and go in.
They walk along a narrow corridor and into a lift.)  
JAMIE: Hey, what's happening? I thought we were looking for Zoe and Isobel.  
VAUGHN: All in good time, young man. The train and the empty crate car will
take some time to get here. In the meantime I'd rather like to talk to you.  
DOCTOR: Oh. really?  
VAUGHN: Yes. Those circuits you gave me, they're rather fascinating. I like to
know more about them.  
(The lift arrives at its destination.)

**[Corridor]**

VAUGHN: This way gentleman.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
(The Doctor and Jamie walk ahead.)  
VAUGHN: Packer. Be a good fellow and see if Professor Watkins is finished,
will you?  
PACKER: Very good, Mister Vaughn.  
VAUGHN: You might offer him a little encouragement. Coming, gentlemen.  
(Packer heads down to floor three with a big grin on his face.)

**[Vaughn's office]**

JAMIE: Hey! Doctor, it's  
VAUGHN: Confusing, isn't it?  
JAMIE: It's exactly the same as your office in London.  
VAUGHN: In all basic essentials, yes, it is. That's the secret of my success,
you see. Uniformity, duplication. My whole empire is based on that principle.
The very essence of business efficiency. Do sit down.  
DOCTOR: Oh, how kind.  
VAUGHN: I must say I'm rather glad we have this opportunity to talk.  
DOCTOR: Really?  
VAUGHN: I should, of course, be angry with you. You've thwarted my elaborate
security precautions twice. I'd like to know why.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's quite simple. I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by
them.  
VAUGHN: Your young friend Zoe.  
JAMIE: Well, what about her?  
VAUGHN: She appears to have the same instincts. She so confused one of my
computers she ruined its memory store.  
JAMIE: So that's why your thugs dragged her and Isobel away.  
VAUGHN: My dear young man, I wasn't angry with her. On the contrary I found
the incident quite amusing. She's a remarkable girl. And you, Doctor, are
obviously a man of no mean scientific ability.  
DOCTOR: Why do you say that?  
VAUGHN: Oh, my research department found these quite fascinating. There's a
totally illogical factor in their construction. Are they of your own
invention?  
Ah, you're determined to guard your secret, I see. I don't blame you, and I
promise not to pry any more. In fact, I'll do all I can to help you.  
DOCTOR: Oh, how kind.  
VAUGHN: Now you say you came here looking for Professor Watkins because you
thought he might be able to help you.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
VAUGHN: Then I'll try to persuade him to put aside his work and er,
concentrate his efforts on your behalf. Make yourself at home.  
(Vaughn leaves.)  
JAMIE: Hey, look, you're not going to trust him, are you? I mean, what about
Zoe and Isobel?  
DOCTOR: I haven't forgotten them, Jamie.  
JAMIE: They're in that box, I'm sure of it.  
DOCTOR: Jamie, we're not going to help Zoe by annoying Mister Vaughn, are we?  
JAMIE: I don't think you could annoy that man even if you want to. He's being
as nice as pie.  
DOCTOR: He's too nice.  
JAMIE: Aye, but why should he be?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. He was a little bit too interested in these circuits for
my liking.  
JAMIE: Hey, do you think he knows about the Tardis then?  
DOCTOR: Well, I don't see how he could do.  
JAMIE: No, well, perhaps this Professor Watkins will be able to tell us what's
going on around here.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but that's what worrying me.  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: Well, if Vaughn has anything to hide, why is he letting us talk to
Watkins?

**[Laboratory]**

PACKER: I'd think about it if I was you, Professor. After all, she's a pretty
girl. It'll be a shame to spoil all that.  
WATKINS: What a vicious sadist, you are, Packer. I don't believe you anyway.  
PACKER: I don't make idle threats, Professor, as you well know. If you want to
see that girl again in one piece I suggest you do as Mister Vaughn asks.  
WATKINS: How do I know that you already haven't harmed her. If you have got
her  
VAUGHN: You can take my word for that, Professor.  
WATKINS: Your word. I know how much I can value I can place on that.  
VAUGHN: Harsh words, Professor, harsh words. Any progress? So, you haven't yet
completed the machine?  
WATKINS: No, and I don't intend to.  
VAUGHN: Oh I think you will, Professor. Much as I detest violence, I find it
difficult to restrain Packer's er, indisputable talent for persuasion. Your
niece is in our custody, and unless you do as I ask, I shall hand her over to
Packer. The choice is yours.  
WATKINS: If I do cooperate, will you let her go?  
VAUGHN: Oh no, she's our guarantee. But she'll come to no harm.  
WATKINS: All right. But I must see Isobel first.  
VAUGHN: Of course. Oh, there is just one other thing. Don't look at me so
suspiciously, my dear Professor. It's merely that there are some friends of
yours here that wish to see you.  
WATKINS: Friends?  
VAUGHN: Yes, they're going to great pains to seek you out.  
WATKINS: But I haven't been allowed visitors since I came here. Why are you
suddenly considerate? I might tell them everything.  
VAUGHN: Everything? My dear Professor, you know nothing that can harm me.
Besides, there's always Isobel to consider, isn't there?  
PACKER: Or would you rather leave her to me?  
VAUGHN: Now, now, Packer. The Professor's going to do exactly as we ask,
aren't you?

**[Vaughn's office]**

(The Doctor and Jamie are looking out of the picture window.)  
JAMIE: There, you see?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, I can see. Let's have a closer look at that, shall we?  
(The Doctor uses Jamie as a support for his telescope.)  
DOCTOR: Now just hold still a minute. Keep your shoulder still. That's odd.
That's very odd.  
JAMIE: What is it?  
(It looks like Fylingdale, which is a neat trick from near London. Sadly those
golf balls no longer exist.)  
DOCTOR: Well, it looks like a deep space radio communication system. What's
it's doing here?  
JAMIE: Don't ask me, you're the brains. Hey look, a helicopter. Could it be
the Brigadier's lot.  
DOCTOR: Yes, it could be.  
JAMIE: Shush. There's someone coming.  
(Packer enters.)  
PACKER: Come along.

**[Aeroplane]**

WALTERS: Hold on, sir, he's just here. Sir, it's Captain Turner.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, Jimmy, any news?  
TURNER [OC]: No, sir. Not a sign of them.  
BRIGADIER: Right, stay in the area. We daren't make a move until we hear from
the Doctor. Over and out.

**[Laboratory]**

WATKINS: Yes, of course, I remember Anne Travers telling me about you. She was
a student of mine, you know, some years ago. Brilliant girl, brilliant.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, they went to America, didn't they?  
WATKINS: Oh, Travers was getting past it a bit, you know, and Anne persuaded
him to go to America with her.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes.  
WATKINS: What are you doing here?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's a long story.

**[Vaughn's office]**

VAUGHN: This strange Doctor's been on another planet, Packer.  
PACKER: That's not possible.  
VAUGHN: It is a fact, Packer. He has some sort of machine. Now let's see if we
can learn more about it, shall we? Switch on, Packer. With sound.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: So we went to see Mister Vaughn. He said that you were
working on something important.  
PACKER: I see. That's why you want to leave them alone together.  
VAUGHN: Exactly, Packer.

**[Laboratory]**

JAMIE: But the Doctor needed some help on some electronic circuits that the
Tardis needed.  
WATKINS: Really?  
JAMIE: Aye, aye.  
(An eye device in a wall moves.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie, I don't think the Professor wants to hear about that.  
WATKINS: On the contrary, what Anne told me about the Tardis was most
intriguing. I'd like to hear a lot more about it.  
DOCTOR: Professor, I think that I should warn you that Anne Travers allowed
her imagination to run a little wild.  
WATKINS: You mean to say there is no such machine?  
JAMIE: Of course there is.  
DOCTOR: Jamie, I think that there are other more important things to talk
about at the moment.  
(The Doctor has gone to one side of the equipment rack and is pointing at the
not very hidden camera.)  
JAMIE: Oh, I see, yes.  
DOCTOR: Professor, tell us about what you're doing here.  
WATKINS: Oh, it's very simple, really. I've been developing a new kind of
teaching machine.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes? A teaching machine?  
JAMIE: What's it called?  
WATKINS: I call it the Cerebraton Mentor.  
JAMIE: Oh, aye?  
WATKINS: The main difference from the other teaching machines is that it is
able to induce emotional changes in the subject.  
JAMIE: Oh.  
(The Doctor puts a small magnet on the camera.)

**[Vaughn's office]**

(The picture is replaced by static.)  
PACKER: Has it broken down?  
VAUGHN: Let's check.  
(Vaughn switches to other cameras around the compound.)  
VAUGHN: All the other monitors are functioning.  
PACKER: Yeah?  
VAUGHN: Our friend the Doctor's a resourceful man. No wonder our allies fear
him.  
PACKER: Our allies know him?  
VAUGHN: Oh, yes. I was ordered to destroy him. But first I must learn the
secrets of this extraordinary machine of his.  
PACKER: If you're been ordered to destroy him  
VAUGHN: I don't take orders, Packer, I give them! Now, I think the time has
come to stop playing games with this Doctor!

**[Laboratory]**

WATKINS: But what can we do? If, as you say, they have Isobel and your young
friend then we're entirely at their mercy.  
DOCTOR: No, no, not entirely. There's my friend the Brigadier, remember.  
WATKINS: Do you think he can help us?  
DOCTOR: Possibly. But quickly, tell me, what is Vaughn up to? What's he doing
here?  
WATKINS: I know no more than you do. He's a ruthless man, without morals or
principles. His object, I'm sure, is to get complete control of the
electronics industry of the world!  
DOCTOR: I wonder. I've a nasty feeling he's aiming somewhat higher than that.  
(Jamie is listening at the door.)  
JAMIE: Doctor, quick, somebody's coming.  
(Vaughn enters.)  
VAUGHN: Don't bother, Doctor. Allow me. Very ingenious. A simple magnet. I
congratulate you.  
DOCTOR: Oh, how kind.  
VAUGHN: However you must surely realise that it's forced me to consider other
methods to make you talk.  
JAMIE: What are you going to do?  
VAUGHN: Your friend Zoe is due to arrive here shortly.  
JAMIE: So you have got her! Listen, if you've harmed her in any way  
VAUGHN: You may still be adolescent enough to make idle threats, young man,
but I can assure you, I am not. I want your travel machine, Doctor. Otherwise
I shall hand your friend Zoe over to Packer. It's a simple choice and
shouldn't take you longer than an hour to consider. Take them away, Packer.  
(The guards manhandle the Doctor and Jamie out of the room.)  
DOCTOR: All right.  
JAMIE: All right.  
PACKER: Leave them to me. I'll take them.  
(Packer leaves.)  
VAUGHN: Now, Professor, I suggest you continue with your work.

**[Corridor]**

DOCTOR: Oh dear. You know, Jamie, I've always been rather scared of lifts.  
JAMIE: Why?  
DOCTOR: I never even like to start them. You'll have to push the button.  
JAMIE: Me?  
PACKER: Keep your mouth shut and do as you're told.  
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. Do as you're told.  
JAMIE: Oh yes, I see  
PACKER: Be quiet!  
(Jamie steps into the lift.)  
DOCTOR: Packer! Mister Packer, I obviously can't let you hurt Zoe, and so I'll
have to tell you all want to know, now.  
PACKER: You mean, you're willing to talk?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure that Mister Vaughn will. Oh, there he is now.  
(Packer turns, the Doctor pushes him away.)  
JAMIE: Quick, Doctor!  
(The Doctor gets into the lift with Jamie and the doors close.)

**[Lift]**

DOCTOR: Your knife.  
JAMIE: Eh?  
DOCTOR: Your knife. Give me your knife.  
JAMIE: What are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: I'm going to try and break the circuit.  
JAMIE: What will that do?  
DOCTOR: It will either stop the lift, or send us out of control.  
JAMIE: But we're six floors up.  
DOCTOR: We'll have to take that risk. Hold tight, here we go.  
(The Doctor pulls the wires in the panel and there's a bang.)

**[Vaughn's office]**

VAUGHN: Why are you so gullible, Packer?  
PACKER: Just wait till I get hold of them. I'll  
VAUGHN: You'll do nothing! I want them in one piece.  
(Packer's wrist communicator buzzes.)  
PACKER: Packer here. Have you got them? Well, what happened? Stuck? How? Well,
get on with it, man! The lift is struck between the fourth and fifth floors.  
VAUGHN: So I gathered, Packer.  
PACKER: Well, it's obviously a mechanical fault. Wait a minute. He did it!  
VAUGHN: Yes, Packer. Our clever Doctor has outwitted you. Oh, then that
wouldn't be too difficult, would it?  
PACKER: Well, it won't do him much good, will it? After all, he can't get
anywhere, can he?  
VAUGHN: No, but then why do it? He might be playing for time, but I doubt it.

**[Lift]**

DOCTOR: There was a fifty-fifty chance, you know, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Yes, but what good has it done us. I mean, we're stuck here in this
lift now.  
DOCTOR: No, no, it's the lift that's stuck, not us. Look.  
(The Doctor points out the emergency exit in the roof.)  
JAMIE: Hey, where does that lead to?  
DOCTOR: Out into the lift shaft, I imagine. Quickly, on me back.  
JAMIE: You know something? You're a clever wee chappie.  
DOCTOR: Jamie.

**[Corridor]**

PACKER: (into comm.) Switch over to the emergency circuits. I want that lift
operational in three minutes! (to guards) I want all lift exits covered. I
want a man on each floor. Move!  
(The guards leave quickly.)  
VAUGHN: Don't panic, Packer. Our birds can't fly away.

**[Lift shaft]**

(Jamie and the Doctor climb onto the roof of the lift and look up the access
ladder.)  
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jamie. Oh my word! Well, that's a long way up, isn't it? Oh
well, we'd better get cracking before they realise what's happened. Perhaps
I'd better shut this.  
JAMIE: Aye.  
(The Doctor closes the lift hatch.)  
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, I've just been thinking. What happens if they get the lift
going before we get to the top?  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's simple.  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: We get squashed.  
JAMIE: What! Well, come on!

**[Corridor]**

PACKER: Right. They've switched over the circuits. The lift's working.  
VAUGHN: How splendid. Bring it up here.  
PACKER: Bring it up to the sixth floor.

**[Lift shaft]**

JAMIE: Hey, that's not what I think it is, is it?  
DOCTOR: I'm very much afraid it is. Come on!  
JAMIE: We'll never make it!  
DOCTOR: Yes, we will! Come on!  
(The lift stops.)  
JAMIE: What's happened?  
DOCTOR: It's stopped. They must be checking. Come on, they may guess where we
are and come after us.

**[Corridor]**

(Packer looks inside the lift.)  
PACKER: They've vanished! They just vanished!  
VAUGHN: Check the other floors!  
PACKER: This is Packer. Check all the lift exits and get me the engineer.
Hello? Yes? Did the lift stop at any other floors on the way up? You're
certain? Right, the engineer's certain.  
VAUGHN: The shaft terminates in the roof, doesn't it, Packer?  
PACKER: Yes, sir.  
VAUGHN: Why didn't you think of that?  
PACKER: I'll get them.  
VAUGHN: Call me when you do, Packer. I'll be in my office. And please don't
fail this time, there's a good fellow.  
(Vaughn leaves.)  
PACKER: This is Packer. Get some men on the roof. They're still in the lift
shaft. No! Don't take the lift. Those two might still be in. (pause) Hey, wait
a minute. I'll take the lift. Tell the engineer to take it right to the top.

**[Lift shaft]**

(The Doctor and Jamie climb past a panel proclaiming Kilroy Was Here!.)  
JAMIE: Only another floor, Doctor. They've started it again!  
DOCTOR: Hurry, Jamie! Hurry!

**[Rooftop]**

(The Doctor and Jamie crawl exhausted out of the lift service door.)  
DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Wait a minute, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: No, come on. Let's see where we are.  
(The Doctor looks over the edge of the building.)  
JAMIE: Now where?  
DOCTOR: Down there.  
JAMIE: Oh no!  
DOCTOR: Well, we can't go down the lift again, can we? Hello. There's a fire
escape. Come on.

**[Vaughn's office]**

VAUGHN: Oh, Packer, you do disappoint me.  
PACKER: They must have got down the fire escape, sir.  
VAUGHN: And, of course, you didn't think to have a guard on that!  
PACKER: Well, normally  
VAUGHN: You're a stupid incompetent! I want that Doctor! Put the whole
compound on alert! Have every available guard on the job! Find him, Packer!
Find him!

**[Freight wagon]**

(The Doctor and Jamie hide between two carriages as a guard passes by and an
alarm sounds, then climb up into an IE marked freight wagon and close the
door.)  
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor. Do you think that this is the train that Zoe and Isobel
came on?  
DOCTOR: It could be.  
JAMIE: Vaughn said that one had empty crates on it, didn't he?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
JAMIE: Well, we'll soon see. Let's look inside.  
(They open a crate. It contains some muslin-like material.)  
JAMIE: Oh no, these are full.  
PACKER [OC]: I want all these trains searched from top to bottom! Move!  
DOCTOR: Jamie! Hide! Quickly, hide!  
(The Doctor goes out of sight and Jamie gets into the crate they just opened.)

**[Crate]**

PACKER [OC]: You two, search this one.  
(Jamie looks on in horror as the material next to him moves.)

__**Episode Four**__

**[Freight wagon]**

(Alarms blaring, Packer and his guards look into the wagon, then close the
door and move on. The Doctor and Jamie come out of their hiding places.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie. Jamie!  
JAMIE: Doctor, I think  
DOCTOR: Shush.  
JAMIE: But Doctor  
DOCTOR: I think the guards are still out there.  
JAMIE: Doctor  
DOCTOR: Keep your voice down.  
JAMIE: That thing in there, it moved. In the crate, there's something alive in
there.  
DOCTOR: Alive? Jamie, the darkness plays funny tricks with the imagination.  
JAMIE: Look, it moved, I tell you.  
DOCTOR: Are you sure?  
JAMIE: Positive.  
DOCTOR: All right, let's have a closer look.  
GUARD [OC]: You two! Over here! Get those two girls over the Main
Administration Building! Move!  
JAMIE: Zoe and Isobel.  
DOCTOR: Wait. We'll follow in a few moments.

**[Vaughn's office]**

PACKER: The whole compound's under alert, Mister Vaughn.  
VAUGHN: And?  
PACKER: Well, er  
VAUGHN: You haven't yet found them.  
PACKER: Well it's only a matter of time.  
VAUGHN: Is it? I doubt it, Packer. This Doctor's far too clever a fish for you
to net.  
PACKER: Well, if you'd let me take care of them properly in the first place
and obeyed the orders of our allies, you might  
VAUGHN: Orders? Me, Packer? I told them and I'll tell you. I give orders, not
take them.  
PACKER: You told them that?  
VAUGHN: The invasion's under my control, and when our purpose has been
achieved I shall still be in control.  
PACKER: You can't fight them.  
VAUGHN: Packer. Why do you think I kept that old fool Watkins alive.  
PACKER: Well, to work on his machine of course.  
VAUGHN: And why did you think I wanted him to do that?  
PACKER: Well, you. I don't know.  
VAUGHN: Our allies appear to find the Professor's machine somewhat disturbing,
so much so in fact that when they saw the prototype they ordered us to destroy
it and all similar machines.  
PACKER: You mean they're frightened of it?  
VAUGHN: The teaching power of the machine didn't worry them, but when I
generated some emotion pulses. I'm convinced, Packer, that emotion could be
used to destroy them.  
PACKER: That's only a guess.  
VAUGHN: A gamble, Packer, a reasonable gamble, and after all we are playing
this game for very high stakes, are we not?  
PACKER: Well, I think you're taking too big a chance.  
VAUGHN: Do you wish to be totally converted? Would you prefer to be one of
them? Completely inhuman?  
PACKER: Oh, no! But  
VAUGHN: That's what'll happen if they take over. We will cease to be human.
So, we must use their force and their might and then discard them.  
PACKER: And you're sure that this machine can do it?  
VAUGHN: Even if we fail, we could escape. The Doctor. We must secure this
spacecraft of his.  
PACKER: Oh yeah, I see. Insurance.  
VAUGHN: Exactly, Packer. The two young ladies have arrived, I hope?  
PACKER: Yes, sir, they're under guard.  
VAUGHN: Good.  
PACKER: They're being taken over to the Main Administration Building now, sir.  
VAUGHN: When they're safely tucked away, we'll flush out our clever Doctor.

**[Outside a building]**

(The Doctor and Jamie watch two crates being taken into the building. One has
a piece of feather boa sticking out.)  
PACKER: Take them inside. Central block, tenth floor.  
(The sound of a helicopter nearby.)  
JAMIE: Could be the Brigadier's lot. Call them up for help!  
DOCTOR: No, no, not yet. We've got to rescue the girls first. Tenth floor,
central block. Come on.

**[Helicopter]**

TURNER: There's a lot of unusual activity, sir. Guards everywhere. It looks
like some sort of emergency.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Any sign of the Doctor and the boy?  
TURNER: No, sir. None at all.  
BRIGADIER: Right, Jimmy. Get out of the area and stand by.  
TURNER: Right, sir. Will do.

**[Aeroplane]**

BRIGADIER: All units, please, Sergeant.  
WALTERS: Yes, sir. Go ahead, sir.  
BRIGADIER: This is the Brigadier. All units stand by. Full penetration of Red
sector imminent.

**[Vaughn's office]**

VAUGHN: A helicopter?  
PACKER: Yes, sir and two of the outer perimeter guard posts reported seeing
strangers in the area outside, sir.  
VAUGHN: I see.  
PACKER: I think this Doctor's with the UNIT organisation. Well, what are we
going to do?  
VAUGHN: Nothing.  
PACKER: Nothing? But they  
VAUGHN: They can't harm us, Packer. We're in control. Or at least I am. Leave
this to me.

**[Outside the Admin building]**

(Jamie and the Doctor sneak around, avoiding guards, until they see a building
with a big A on it.)  
JAMIE: What's that?  
DOCTOR: I should think that's the central block, wouldn't you, Jamie?  
JAMIE: How do we find out which room they're in? And when we have how do we
get them out?  
DOCTOR: Stop looking for problems, Jamie. Let's get along up there, shall we?  
(An announcement comes over the compound tannoys.)  
VAUGHN [OC]: Doctor. If you can hear me, listen. You have ten minutes, Doctor.
Ten minutes to relinquish your freedom. At the end of that time, your young
friend Zoe will pay the consequences of your foolish and totally pointless
opposition. Ten minutes, Doctor, ten minutes.  
JAMIE: There's not much time.  
DOCTOR: There's just about time enough to effect a simple rescue operation.
Come along, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Simple?  
DOCTOR: Yes, come along.

**[Room]**

(Isobel is hammering on the locked door.)  
ISOBEL: Oh, let us out of here, you stupid, idiotic. Oh, why have they brought
us here?  
ZOE: I suppose because I ruined that stupid computer of theirs. Well, I'm
sorry.  
ISOBEL: But why kidnap us? Why don't they just turn us over to the police or
something?  
ZOE: I don't know. Anyway, we've got to get out of here.  
ISOBEL: We can't get out this way. Look, it's a sheer drop. Hey, Zoe! Zoe,
look!  
ZOE: Doctor! Jamie!

**[Fire escape]**

ZOE [OC]: We're up here!  
JAMIE: Doctor, it's them, look!  
DOCTOR: Good. As long they don't give the game away too soon.  
(The Doctor gestures the girls to keep quiet and move back.)

**[Room]**

ISOBEL: It looked as if they were trying to tell us something.  
ZOE: The Doctor wants us to keep away from the window for some reason.  
ISOBEL: I wonder why?  
ZOE: Well, I'm not sure.  
(Zoe spots the surveillance camera.)  
ZOE: Just try and act as though nothing has happened. Don't look now, but
we're being spied on.

**[Aeroplane]**

BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor, come in.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Brigadier, I think we shall require a little assistance in a few
moments.  
BRIGADIER: Why? Are you in trouble?  
DOCTOR [OC]: No, but we shall need help. You have a helicopter in the area?  
BRIGADIER: Yes.  
DOCTOR [OC]: I wonder, have they a rope ladder on board.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, I pretty sure they have. Where are you?  
DOCTOR [OC]: We're just going up to the roof of the main building. That is the
central block on the north side. That should give your helicopter cover should
there be any ground fire. Have you got that?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, I've got that. Over and out.

**[Vaughn's office]**

PACKER: All right, keep looking. Find them!  
(Guards leave.)  
PACKER: I've got the whole place covered, Mister Vaughn.  
VAUGHN: Don't worry, Packer. They won't risk any harm coming to their little
friends. Doctor, you have five minutes. Five minutes.  
PACKER: They won't give themselves up. They'd be mad to.  
(Vaughn goes to the window and looks at the helicopter crossing the compound
boundary.)  
VAUGHN: Not mad Packer, merely human.  
PACKER: It's the same one! The same helicopter.  
VAUGHN: Yes. Perhaps they do mean to save their own skins, after all. Probably
the helicopter's trying to pick them up. Stop them! Shoot it down if
necessary!  
PACKER: Yes, sir.  
(He rushes out.)

**[Rooftop]**

(Jamie and the Doctor reach the top of the fire escape. The helicopter
manoeuvres over them and drops the rope ladder. Jamie grabs it.)  
JAMIE: You're not going to leave the lassies by themselves are you?  
DOCTOR: No, no, of course not. Help me to get this over the side there.  
(They drop the rest of the ladder down the building, across the window to Zoe
and Isobel's prison.)  
DOCTOR: Right. Down you go, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Eh?  
(Jamie goes down. At one point the downdraft makes him lose his grip but he
recovers.)

**[Room]**

ISOBEL: Something must be going on.  
ZOE: It is a helicopter. Hey, look, it's Jamie!  
ISOBEL: Oh yeah!  
ZOE: Give me a hand with this. We have to barricade the door.  
ISOBEL: Oh, yeah.  
(The girls jam a chair under the door handle)  
ZOE: Keep the guards out. Quick, bring the filing cabinet. Push.  
ISOBEL: Oh, sorry. Packer could never get through that.  
ZOE: Jamie, be careful!  
(Jamie climbs in through the window holding the end of the ladder.)  
JAMIE: Right now, quick, up you go.  
ISOBEL: Oh! You don't think we're going up that, do you?  
JAMIE: Do you want to be left here with Vaughn and Packer? Now go on! Get
going. Come on, now. Watch yourself. Easy.  
(Zoe climbs out of the window and starts up the ladder.)  
JAMIE: Hang on to the ladder tightly. Whatever you do, don't let it go. And
don't look down either! Right, Isobel, now you.  
(Jamie follows the mini-skirted girls up the ladder.)

**[Outside the Admin building]**

PACKER: Guards, follow me.  
(The girls are safely on the roof.)  
PACKER: There he is. Fire!  
(The guards open fire with automatic weapons. Jamie reaches the roof.

**[Rooftop]**

DOCTOR: Well done, Jamie.  

**[Outside the Admin building]**

PACKER: Get up there. Stop them!

**[Rooftop]**

ISOBEL: Oh, thank goodness that's over.  
DOCTOR: I'm afraid it isn't quite yet, Isobel.  
ISOBEL: Oh, no.  
(One at a time they start up the ladder to the helicopter.)

**[Outside the Admin building]**

PACKER: Come on! Get up there after them! Quickly!  
(Zoe gets on board, and Isobel is following as the Doctor dodges shrapnel from
the bullets hitting the edge of the building. Then he climbs the ladder.)

**[Helicopter]**

DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. Hurry up!  
(Guards have reached the rooftop and have a clear shot at Jamie.)  
DOCTOR: Get us out of here! Hold on, Jamie!  
(The helicopter gains altitude as Jamie hangs onto the ladder then climbs
onboard.)

**[Aeroplane]**

(Gunfire is heard over the RT.)  
BRIGADIER: Jimmy! What's happening, Jimmy? Do you want ground support?  
TURNER [OC]: Hello, sir. No, mission accomplished. On our way back now.  
BRIGADIER: Splendid. No casualties?  
TURNER [OC]: No, sir. All well. Fortunately Vaughn's jackboots couldn't shoot
a flying elephant. Over and out.  
BRIGADIER: All units, please, Sergeant.  
WALTERS: Yes, sir. Go ahead, sir.  
BRIGADIER: All UNIT groups. Red alert cancelled. I say again, Red alert
cancelled. Return to base.

**[Vaughn's office]**

PACKER: That helicopter was one of the UNIT force group. I told you.  
VAUGHN: Don't panic, Packer. You've blundered again, but fortunately it won't
really matter.  
PACKER: Matter? There's bound to be an official reaction.  
VAUGHN: There will be no official reaction. I've told you, we are in command.  
PACKER: But  
VAUGHN: Don't argue, Packer! Just do as you're told, man! And for once, do it
right!  
PACKER: Yes, sir.  
VAUGHN: Now, I want Professor Watkins' Cerebraton machine loaded into my car.
We're going back to London.  
PACKER: Back to London, sir? But you can't go back  
VAUGHN: Due to your clumsiness, Packer, we must now alter our plans. I intend
to bring the invasion forward. We have twenty four hours to prepare for it.  
PACKER: Twenty four hours? But they'll never agree to it. The invasion forces
aren't anywhere near complete, sir.  
VAUGHN: They'll be sufficient for our immediate purpose. After the invasion,
we'll no longer have no need for secrecy. Now, you attend to the Professor and
I'll deal with our UNIT friends. Bring Watkins up here to me when you're
ready.  
PACKER: Yes, sir.  
(Packer leaves. Vaughn goes to his intercom.)  
VAUGHN: Get me the Ministry of Defence and switch it through to my visual
circuit.  
SECRETARY [on monitor]: Good morning. Ministry of Defence. Can I help you?  
VAUGHN: Yes, get me. Ah, good morning. Major General Rutlidge, please.  
SECRETARY [on monitor]: Just one moment. Who is calling, please?  
VAUGHN: Tobias Vaughn.

**[Rutlidge's office]**

(Rutlidge is already on the telephone.)  
RUTLIDGE: Fine, sir, fine. We'll meet this evening for dinner, then. What? oh,
about eight. Yes, at the club. Good. Fine. Goodbye, sir.  
(Rutlidge puts down the handset and it switches to line two.)  
RUTLIDGE: Yes?  
SECRETARY [OC]: Outside call for you, sir.  
RUTLIDGE: Male or female?  
SECRETARY [OC]: It's a Mister Tobias Vaughn, sir.  
RUTLIDGE: Vaughn?  
SECRETARY [OC]: Yes sir. Shall I put him through?  
RUTLIDGE: Vaughn? Yes, yes.  
SECRETARY [OC]: Just one moment.  
RUTLIDGE: Operator?  
SECRETARY [OC]: Yes, sir?  
RUTLIDGE: Priority scramble.  
SECRETARY [OC]: Yes, sir.  
(Vaughn's face appears where the dial would normally be on a telephone set.)  
VAUGHN [on monitor]: Ah, Rutlidge. Can we be overheard?  
RUTLIDGE: No, no, no. Priority scramble is in operation.  
VAUGHN [on monitor]: Good. Now listen. Your friends in the UNIT groups has
been causing trouble. They must be stopped, understand?  
RUTLIDGE: I, er, I understand.  
VAUGHN [on monitor]: There must be no more interference.  
RUTLIDGE: No, no. I'll deal with it.  
VAUGHN [on monitor: Good fellow. Knew I could rely on you.  
(Transmission ends.)  
RUTLIDGE: I understand.

**[Aeroplane]**

BRIGADIER: You were lucky. Dead lucky.  
JAMIE: He said that it would be a simple rescue operation. Simple.  
ISOBEL: But what about my uncle? They've still got him prisoner.  
BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Miss Watkins. As soon we return to base, I'm going to
raise hell and get some action.  
JAMIE: You think they'll listen to you now?  
BRIGADIER: No one, not even Tobias Vaughn, can go as far as trying to shoot
down one of my helicopters.  
ISOBEL: Oh, I wished I had my camera. I could have got a fortune with those
pictures.  
TURNER: Yes, it was a pity. That would have clinched it as far as the Ministry
are concerned, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Jimmy. Billy Rutlidge will have to take some action
now.  
JAMIE: Doctor? Hey, Doctor, what's the matter?  
DOCTOR: Hmm? Jamie, that object on the other side of the moon.  
BRIGADIER: Other side of the?  
ZOE: Yes. The Tardis went wrong, you see, and we had a sort of, well what,
Doctor? A forced landing?  
DOCTOR: Mmm? Yeah.  
ZOE: And then they fired a missile at us.  
BRIGADIER: Who?  
ZOE: Well, whoever it was who was on that spaceship on the other side of the
moon.  
BRIGADIER: Spaceships? On the other side of the Moon?  
DOCTOR: And then there was that deep space radio transmitter. I wonder.  
TURNER: Look, sir. I know this may sound ridiculous, but could those reported
sightings of UFOs have anything to do with this?  
JAMIE: UFOs? What's that?  
ISOBEL: Unidentified Flying Objects. Flying saucers?  
TURNER: But these weren't saucers. All of the sightings were quite clear on
that.  
DOCTOR: Did anyone, by any chance, photograph any of these objects?  
TURNER: Oh yes, we've got several in the files. Shall I get them?  
DOCTOR: Oh, if you would be so kind.  
TURNER: Right.  
DOCTOR: Unidentified Flying Objects.

**[Laboratory]**

WATKINS: What was that shooting going on? If you harmed Isobel  
VAUGHN: She's perfectly safe, Professor.  
WATKINS: Why am I being taken back to London? What about my niece? What's
happened to Isobel?  
VAUGHN: I tell you, she's perfectly safe.  
WATKINS: Well, I want to see her!  
VAUGHN: So you shall, when you've finished working on your machine. Do as I
ask and you shall both go free.  
WATKINS: You don't even expect me to believe you, do you?  
VAUGHN: Well, you've very little choice. Now, we're going back to London.
There you will work on your machine to my specifications. You will have twenty
four hours to complete it. Only if you hasn't finished your work by that time,
would you have cause to worry about your niece.  
(Vaughn leaves.)  
PACKER: Got everything you need?  
WATKINS: Everything.  
PACKER: Come on, then. Move.

**[Aeroplane]**

(Top secret photographs are scattered over the map table.)  
BRIGADIER: Mean anything to you, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Possibly. How long ago were these objects first sighted?  
BRIGADIER: Reports have been drifting in for well over a year now. We sent up
fighter planes to investigate, but nothing ever came of it.  
TURNER: The odd thing about these sightings is that they usually seem to
disappear somewhere over south east England.  
ISOBEL: But isn't that where all those factories and laboratories of Vaughn's
are?  
TURNER: Exactly. That's why I brought it up.  
DOCTOR: Jamie, when you were hiding in that crate, you say something moved?  
JAMIE: Aye, it was wrapped up in that gauze stuff.  
DOCTOR: Did you recognise it at all?  
JAMIE: No.  
ZOE: What do you think it was, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. We've got to find out and quickly.  
ZOE: How?  
DOCTOR: Well, obviously they bring these things, whatever they are, up from
the factory in the country to the London premises. That's where we're going to
find the answer.  
JAMIE: You mean go back to Vaughn's place?  
BRIGADIER: I don't think that's wise, Doctor. You're been lucky so far.  
JAMIE: Aye, if you think I'm going back inside there  
DOCTOR: Jamie, we have to find what is inside these crates. Brigadier, have
you got a map? Including the London premises.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, yes, I think so. Sergeant Walters!  
WALTERS: Sir.  
BRIGADIER: May we have map number eight please?  
WALTERS: Yes, sir.  
TURNER: I'll get it, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Thank you. Here we are. Now this, this is the whole area in detail.
London offices, warehouse area and surrounding buildings.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I see.  
JAMIE: But Doctor, you can't go back the same way again. They'll be waiting
for us this time.  
DOCTOR: Oh my word. How very fortunate.  
BRIGADIER: Anything I can do to help?  
DOCTOR: Brigadier, you don't, by any chance, know where I can find a canoe?

**[Canal]**

(The Doctor and Jamie paddle a rigid canoe down the Regents canal leading
under a bridge.  
JAMIE: Are you sure this is how we get in?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Now come on.  
(They moor the canoe by the tow path.)  
DOCTOR: Go on, I'm holding it steady.  
(The Doctor and Jamie walk up some steps and along narrow alleys, avoiding
armed guards.

**[Warehouse]**

(The Doctor and Jamie see two men in protective suits and a white-coated
scientist with one of the crates leaning against a wall, open.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie, I'm afraid I was right.  
JAMIE: Eh?  
(A whirly device is switched on. It starts throbbing. A man attaches two
cables to the wrapped object and the scientist turns dials. A second sound
starts up and the thing inside the fabric moves. The cloth is suddenly ripped
apart to reveal - a Cyberman!)

__**Episode Five**__

**[Warehouse]**

JAMIE: (sotto) The Cybermen.  
DOCTOR: Shush.  
JAMIE: Where do they come from?  
DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie, but they're here, aren't they?! Come on, let's go
back to the canoe.  
(They paddle back down the canal.)

**[Aeroplane]**

ZOE: And what do you think will happen?  
TURNER: Well, it's not really a military matter now.  
ISOBEL: You'll simply hand this over to the police.  
TURNER: More or less.  
ISOBEL: Pity. I could have got some great pictures and made a bomb selling
them to the papers. Oh, well.  
TURNER: Look, perhaps I can compensate by buying you dinner.  
ISOBEL: That would be nice. Hey are you stinking rich?  
TURNER: Not on a Captain's pay, I'm not.  
ISOBEL: It's not my day, is it?  
TURNER: Money isn't everything, you know.  
(The Doctor and Jamie enter.)  
ZOE: Doctor, any luck? What did you find out?  
JAMIE: Some old friends of ours are here, Zoe.  
ZOE: Who?  
JAMIE: The Cybermen.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid it's true, Zoe.  
ZOE: That's what you suspected, wasn't it?  
ISOBEL: What on Earth are Cybermen?  
DOCTOR: They're from another world. Inhuman killers.  
TURNER: You mean they're from space, or something.  
DOCTOR + ZOE: Yes.  
ZOE: And that spaceship we saw on the other side of the Moon was obviously
their craft.  
ISOBEL: What are they? Little green men? Oh, you're serious?  
ZOE: We've met Cybermen before and seen what they can do.  
TURNER: Where exactly are they and how many?  
JAMIE: At Vaughn's headquarters in London.  
DOCTOR: Oh, there's hundreds of them, possibly thousands.  
ZOE: So Vaughn's helping them.  
DOCTOR: That deep space radio transmitter is obviously being used by the
Cybermen spaceships to home in on.  
TURNER: So that's what those UFOs were. But there have been hundreds of those
sightings.  
JAMIE: Aye, they must have quite an army by now. The thing is, where are they
hiding them all?  
DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. Captain, where's the Brigadier.  
TURNER: At the Ministry of Defence. I better get on to him immediately and
tell him what you've discovered.  
DOCTOR: No, no, Captain. The people who went into Vaughn's headquarters were
different when they came out, weren't they?  
TURNER: Yes.  
ZOE: Do you think they're being controlled, Doctor?  
TURNER: Controlled?  
ZOE: Yes, the Cybermen have means of controlling people's minds. They appear
to be almost normal but they're not, they're controlled.  
DOCTOR: Who is the Brigadier is immediately answerable to?  
TURNER: Major-General Rutlidge.

**[Rutlidge's office]**

BRIGADIER: No cause for alarm? Billy, do you realise what's happened? They
tried to shoot down one of my helicopters.  
RUTLIDGE: You were trespassing over their top security area.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, for heaven sake. If you can't trust a UNIT force, who can you
trust?  
RUTLIDGE: There's nothing we  
BRIGADIER: What's the matter?  
RUTLIDGE: Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.  
BRIGADIER: Look, Billy, Vaughn's a powerful chap, I know that. But surely we
can at least request a thorough investigation.  
RUTLIDGE: This isn't our province.  
BRIGADIER: Well then, who's province is it?  
RUTLIDGE: It's no good in getting angry about this. You must see this from my
point of view. All you've given me is vague reports, nothing conclusive, no
proof.  
BRIGADIER: No proof!  
RUTLIDGE: I'm sure this is a misunderstanding. I talk to the C in C of
internal security myself.  
BRIGADIER: But Billy, talk isn't going to help. I want some sort of action,
and I want it now. At least get the civil authorities to investigate.  
RUTLIDGE: You have to leave this matter with me.  
BRIGADIER: Will I?  
RUTLIDGE: If you're thinking of going to see the C in C yourself, I shouldn't
bother. You'll be wasting your time.  
BRIGADIER: So you're going to do nothing? What sort of hold has Vaughn got on
you?  
RUTLIDGE: Vaughn? I. Brigadier, your UNIT force will take no precipitous
action without top-priority permission. That is an order.  
BRIGADIER: I see, sir. Well, you can override my authority but not that of
UNIT Central Command. I'm sending a full report to them in Geneva.  
(Lethbridge-Stewart salutes and leaves. Rutlidge activates his intercom.)  
RUTLIDGE: International Electromatics, Central Office.  
SECRETARY [OC]: Just one moment please, sir.  
RUTLIDGE: Oh, er, with priority scramble.  
SECRETARY [OC]: Yes sir.

**[Vaughn's office]**

VAUGHN: Have Gregory work with Professor Watkins on the machine.  
PACKER: Yes, Mister Vaughn. VAUGHN: No, wait.  
(Vaughn answers his intercom.)  
VAUGHN: Report.  
MAN [OC]: Communication from Major General Rutlidge on public video.  
VAUGHN: Switch to visual circuit. What is it, Rutlidge?  
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: The UNIT group.  
VAUGHN: Well?  
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: There'll be trouble. I can't stop it.  
VAUGHN: Why not? You have authority to.  
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: I have no authority outside this country. A report is
being made to UNIT Central Control. They're bound to investigate and take
action.  
VAUGHN: I see. How long before this will be effective?  
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: I think I should (stops)  
VAUGHN: Rutlidge. Rutlidge!  
PACKER: What's the matter with him?  
VAUGHN: Listen to me, Rutlidge? Listen! You will obey my commands. You
understand?  
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: Your commands.  
VAUGHN: You will leave your office and come here to me.  
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: To you.  
VAUGHN: Immediately. Do you understand?  
RUTLIDGE [on monitor]: I must. Your commands.  
VAUGHN: Do you understand?  
RUTLIDGE [on monitor] : Yes. I understand. I understand.  
VAUGHN: Good fellow.  
(Transmission ends.)  
PACKER: What was the matter with him?  
VAUGHN: Our control over him is weakening.  
PACKER: Well, that could be dangerous. If he doesn't obey your orders to come
over here, he might  
VAUGHN: Oh, he will, Packer, he will.

**[Aeroplane]**

(Walters takes a telephone call.)  
WALTERS: Are you sure, Miss? I see. Right, thanks. Sir!  
TURNER: Got him?  
WALTERS: No sir, General Rutlidge's secretary said he left some time ago.  
TURNER: I see. What about the Brigadier?  
WALTERS: Apparently he wasn't there long, sir. He must be on his way back now.  
TURNER: Right. Doctor, it seems we're too late. The Brigadier's already been
in to see Rutlidge.  
DOCTOR: Oh, dear.  
TURNER: Yes. The question is now, where exactly do we stand with Rutlidge?

**[Vaughn's office]**

VAUGHN: I must know, Rutlidge. You must tell me. How long? How long before the
UNIT forces can take action!  
RUTLIDGE: I. One day, maybe two.  
VAUGHN: Good. Time enough.  
PACKER: Well, I don't like it. Supposing the UNIT forces move faster than
that? Suppose they want to come over  
VAUGHN: Let me do the supposing, Packer.  
PACKER: Yes, Mister Vaughn.  
VAUGHN: Now, just to be on the safe side, I think we'd better conduct an
experiment.  
PACKER: What do you mean?  
VAUGHN: Have the Professor's machine taken down to the warehouse. Wait
outside. I'll join you later.  
PACKER: What are you going to do?  
VAUGHN: Wait and see, Packer. Wait and see.  
PACKER: Yes, sir. What about him?  
VAUGHN: Oh, leave him to me.  
(Packer leaves. Vaughn opens the secret panel.)  
VAUGHN: There has been some difficulty. We must alter our plans.  
PLANNER: Report the difficulty and we will assess it.  
VAUGHN: We must bring the invasion forward.  
PLANNER: Our invasion force is not yet complete.  
VAUGHN: The invasion must take place in fifteen hours time, otherwise we may
have to face the combined forces of the entire world.  
PLANNER: Wait while the report will be assessed.  
VAUGHN: You will accept what I say or our partnership is at an end. The
invasion will take place at dawn tomorrow.  
PLANNER: It has been agreed. The data will be computed and the invasion
details transmitted to you. Discussion terminated.

**[Warehouse]**

(More Cybermen are being reactivated.)  
PACKER: How many more?  
WORKMAN: About fifty more crates.  
PACKER: Hurry it up.  
WORKMAN: Yes, sir.  
(Packer opens a secret door in a nearby brick wall.)  
PACKER: Follow me.

**[Secret room]**

(Packer goes up a wooden staircase.)  
PACKER: Have you received your instructions?  
CYBERMEN: Yes.  
PACKER: You will proceed through the sewer tunnels to your allotted sectors.
There you will obey the commands of your sector leader.  
CYBERMEN: We understand.  
PACKER: Proceed.

**[Aeroplane]**

(The Doctor has a diagram labelled Main Drainage.)  
DOCTOR: You see, a network of tunnels underneath London.  
BRIGADIER: And that's where you think they might be?  
DOCTOR: Yes. And look. There's a main flood relief sewer running right
underneath the warehouse.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, but if there's water in the sewers, wouldn't that affect them?  
DOCTOR: Oh no, no. Besides, many of these tunnels are dry and only flood
during heavy rainfall.  
ISOBEL: What do we do, pray for a cloudburst?  
BRIGADIER: Miss Watkins, this could be very serious.  
ISOBEL: I'm sorry, but, well, it's a pretty fantastic story to swallow.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, but so was the attack from the Yeti, but nevertheless it
happened.  
TURNER: With all due respect sir, she's right. No one believed in the Yetis
until they saw them. If you go to Central Command with this story, they'll
think you're mad.  
BRIGADIER: Yes. Yes, Jimmy, you're right. Of course, what we really need is
some sort of evidence, some proof.  
DOCTOR: It might be better at the moment to find out what form this attack's
going to take. Jamie?  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: That transistor radio that Vaughn gave you. Have you still got it?  
JAMIE: Aye, here.  
(Jamie hands it over and the Doctor starts to dismantle it.)  
DOCTOR: Brigadier, have you any IE equipment here?  
BRIGADIER: Er, Jimmy, have we?  
JIMMY: Yes, we have, sir. A computer and various radio and radar components.  
DOCTOR: May I see them, please?  
BRIGADIER: Certainty. Jimmy, would you?  
TURNER: I'll show you, Doctor. This way  
DOCTOR: Thank you.

**[Warehouse]**

(Packer watches Cybermen carefully go down a manhole in the secret room, then
goes back out to the warehouse proper.)  
VAUGHN: Ah, there you are, Packer. Everything going well?  
PACKER: Yes, Mister Vaughn.  
VAUGHN: Good. Time for our little experiment.  
GREGORY: Mister Vaughn, I don't think you should  
VAUGHN: We must try the machine, Gregory.  
GREGORY: But it's dangerous.  
VAUGHN: It would be even more dangerous if we didn't try it. We must make sure
we have an effective weapon against the Cybermen.  
PACKER: You're going to try it on one of them?  
VAUGHN: Why not?  
(Vaughn goes up to a crate.)  
VAUGHN: Revive it just enough to bring it out of its cocoon.  
TECHNICIAN: Yes, sir.  
(The technicians attach the cables to the cocoon then switch on the machine.
The Cyberman rips open the material.)  
VAUGHN: Hold it there. Now, Gregory, connect the Professor's machine.  
(Gregory puts a box on the floor and holds a cable nervously.)  
GREGORY: Mister Vaughn, please.  
VAUGHN: Connect it!  
(Gregory puts the 'stethoscope' attachment onto the Cyberman's head, picks up
his box and backs away.)  
GREGORY: What emotion shall I induce?  
VAUGHN: Fear. Let's see how the Cybermen will react to fear.  
(Gregory switches on his box.)  
Increase the power.  
(The Cyberman starts to sway and make groaning electronic noises.)  
VAUGHN: More power!  
GREGORY: That's all there is.  
(The Cyberman rips the attachment from its head and staggers around, flailing
its arms. Guards shoot at it to no effect.)  
PACKER: Quick!  
The humans get out of its way as the Cyberman staggers into the secret room.)  
GREGORY: I warned you, the machine isn't ready yet. It's following the others
into the sewers.  
VAUGHN: Let it go.  
PACKER: It's gone mad. It could have killed us all.  
VAUGHN: Possibly, but I think we've proved that the Professor's machine can be
effective. Get him to work on it, Gregory. I want twice as much power and I
want directional control.  
PACKER: Yeah, but what about that one? You can't let it roam down there alone!  
VAUGHN: Why not?  
PACKER: Well, it'll kill anything that gets in its way.  
VAUGHN: Good. Anyone fool enough to be down in those sewers deserves to die.

**[Aeroplane]**

ISOBEL: Now you really believe that these Cybermen things are down in the
sewers.  
BRIGADIER: Seems to make sense.  
ISOBEL: But you can't do anything about it without proof or evidence.  
BRIGADIER: Central Command would think I was mad.  
ISOBEL: Well, the answer's simple, surely. Go and get some proof.  
BRIGADIER: And how do I prove that in the sewers of London there are creatures
from outer space waiting to attack us. Go and get one?  
ZOE: You wouldn't stand a chance against them, Isobel.  
ISOBEL: Ah, you wouldn't have to go anywhere near them. Photograph them.  
BRIGADIER: That's not a bad idea. Now, wait a minute, it'd be pitch dark down
in those tunnels.  
ISOBEL: You could use an infrared film, a twenty five filter on a thirty five
mil camera with a telephoto lens, and why, you could take frame after frame
without getting anywhere near them.  
BRIGADIER: Is that all gibberish or do you really know what you're talking
about?  
ISOBEL: Of course I know.  
BRIGADIER: If you're right, it could well be the sort of proof I need to get
some action.  
ISOBEL: Well, all I need is my cameras from the house and then I'm all set.  
BRIGADIER: Now, wait a minute, This is hardly a job for you.  
ISOBEL: Why ever not?  
BRIGADIER: Well, you're a young woman. This is a job for my men.  
ISOBEL: Well, of all the bigoted, anti-feminist, cretinous remarks  
BRIGADIER: This is no job for a girl like you. Now that's final.  
ISOBEL: Oh, you, you, you man!  
BRIGADIER: I'll get in touch with my photographic unit and get them onto it.  
ISOBEL: Oh, that stupid bigoted idiotic  
JAMIE: Aye, well, he's right, you know.  
ZOE: Jamie McCrimmon!  
JAMIE: Well, he is.  
ZOE: Just because you're a man you think that you're superior, do you?  
JAMIE: Now, I didn't say that. Of course, it's true.  
ZOE: Is it really? Right. Coming, Isobel?  
ISOBEL: What a splendid idea.  
JAMIE: Where are you going?  
ZOE: Do you think we should let him come with us?  
ISOBEL: Oh, I don't know. Men aren't much good in situations like this.  
JAMIE: Just a moment. Where are you're going?  
ISOBEL: London. Coming?  
JAMIE: London? Now we shouldn't do anything without the Doctor! Och.  
(Isobel and Zoe leave, followed by Jamie. In another section of the big
Hercules transport -)  
DOCTOR: This is rather like looking for the proverbial needle in the
proverbial. Just a minute  
TURNER: Found something?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. Wait a minute.  
(The Doctor pulls a small computer chip from a piece of UNIT equipment.)  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm almost sure that this is same sort of circuit that was
in Jamie's radio.  
TURNER: But what does it do?  
DOCTOR: I've no idea. But it's certainly not part of that equipment. Have a
look.  
TURNER: But why put it a circuit if it doesn't do anything.  
DOCTOR: Oh, it does something, all right. The question is what?

**[Vaughn's office]**

PLANNER: One hour before invasion, the Cyber-transmitter units will be
launched into orbit around Earth.  
VAUGHN: The effect will be immediate?  
PLANNER: Yes. Transmissions will penetrate all areas.  
VAUGHN: And if it doesn't work?  
PLANNER: Humans cannot resist Cyber-control. Our forces will penetrate all
areas and select suitable humans for cybernetic conversion.  
VAUGHN: Conversion to Cybermen?  
PLANNER: Yes. The unsuitable humans will be destroyed.  
VAUGHN: No! This is not as we agreed!  
PLANNER: It has been decided.  
VAUGHN: We agreed that I should remain in control of Earth. In return, I
supply the minerals you require. You will honour that bargain, otherwise there
will be no invasion!  
PLANNER: To control, you must undergo complete conversion and become one of
us.  
VAUGHN: No! My body may be cybernetic but my mind stays human. That is final!  
PLANNER: It has been agreed. Discussion concluded.  
(Vaughn closes the secret panel.)  
PACKER: You don't trust them?  
VAUGHN: Of course not. I know they'll try to take control from me when the
invasion's complete, but then, they don't know about the Cerebraton Machine,
do they?  
PACKER: Well, I don't like it. That thing just said humans can't resist
control. How do we know these Cyber-transmissions aren't going to affect us?  
VAUGHN: They won't. We shall be protected by the implanted audio-rejection
capsules. You see, Packer, I've thought all this out in detail. Nothing has
been overlooked.

**[Aeroplane]**

TURNER: Found anything?  
DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid not. What I really need is laboratory facilities. I'm
sure that this micro-monolithic circuit is something to do with the Cybermen's
invasion plan.  
TURNER: Perhaps we can find a lab for you to work in.  
DOCTOR: Oh, no, that's no problem, I can go up to London and use Professor
Watkins' laboratory at Travers's house.  
TURNER: Right. I'll arrange transport.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
(Turner peers at the circuit in Jamie's transistor radio. Meanwhile, the
Brigadier is on the RT.)  
BRIGADIER: I'll arrange for a helicopter to transport the photographic detail
here for a briefing. Over.  
MAN [OC]: Very good, sir. They'll be standing by. Out.  
DOCTOR: Brigadier?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Where's Jamie and Zoe and Isobel.  
BRIGADIER: I've no idea. Sergeant Walters?  
WALTERS: Yes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Friends of the Doctors. Any idea where they are?  
WALTERS: They took a van and went back to London, sir.  
DOCTOR: London? What on earth for?  
WALTERS: Well, they said that they were going to get something important for
the Brigadier, sir.  
BRIGADIER: For me?  
WALTERS: Yes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, no, they surely couldn't have been so stupid as. Sergeant
Walters.  
WALTERS: Sir?  
BRIGADIER: Get Benton on the radio link.  
WALTERS: Yes, sir.  
DOCTOR: What's the matter? What's happened?  
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Doctor, but I think those crazy kids have gone off to
the sewers to get photos of the Cybermen!  
DOCTOR: What?

**[Street]**

(Corporal Benton is now in a UNIT uniform. He parks the Land Rover Jeep by a
meter. Isobel has got a camera with her.)  
JAMIE: Well, at least let's call the Doctor up first.  
ZOE: Scared, Jamie?  
JAMIE: No. I mean, I don't even know what we're going to do.  
ISOBEL: Well, come on then.  
JAMIE: Och. Women.  
(Isobel, Zoe and Jamie leave Benton in the jeep.)  
RADIO [OC]: UNIT transport car two three report in, over.  
(BENTON picks up the microphone to his radio.)  
BENTON: Car two three to UNIT command. Receiving you, over.

**[Aeroplane]**

WALTERS: There you are, sir.  
BRIGADIER: This is the Brigadier. Have you still got your passengers?  
BENTON [OC]: No, sir. I've just dropped them.  
BRIGADIER: Your position.  
BENTON [OC]: In the vicinity of Red sector one, sir. Shepherd Street.  
WALTERS: That's almost on top of Vaughn's HQ, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Benton, listen. Try and make contact with your passengers again and
get them to report in to me.  
BENTON [OC]: I'll try, sir, but I'm not sure which way they've gone.  
BRIGADIER: Don't make excuses, Benton. This is a top priority alert. Out. (to
Walters) Thank you. Jimmy, I want you to take charge of this operation. Get
over there at once, will you?  
TURNER: Right, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Sergeant.  
DOCTOR: I'd better go back to London with him and see if I can make some sort
of sense of these circuits. I'm going to have to leave my three friends in
your very capable hands.  
BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Doctor. We'll get them back.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
(The Doctor leaves.)  
BRIGADIER: I hope.

**[Sewers]**

(At the junction of Fore Street and Moor Lane, a manhole cover clangs onto the
tarmac. The City of London is so easy to film in on a Sunday.)  
JAMIE [OC]: Third time lucky.  
ZOE: Good. Go on, then, Jamie. Down we go.  
JAMIE: Me? But, er. Och.  
(Jamie climbs down the ladder, not looking up at Zoe's knickers.)  
ZOE: Right, come on, Isobel.  
JAMIE: Shush!  
ZOE: Lower your camera down to me.

**[Fore Street]**

(A policeman walks past the Post Office - not there now - and calls to Isobel
as she sits in the open manhole.)  
POLICEMAN: Hey you! What do you think you're doing going down there for, you
young idiots!  
(Isobel goes down the ladder. Benton arrives in the jeep and goes over to the
policeman.)  
POLICEMAN: Hey, you kids! Come on out of there, or I'll come down after you.

**[Sewers]**

POLICEMAN [OC]: I know you're down there. Are you going to come up or do I
have to come down to fetch you.  
JAMIE: (sotto) That's all we need. If he carrying on shouting like that we'll
have every Cyberman in the area on top of us.  
ZOE: Shush. Jamie, look. I think that there's something further down the
tunnel.  
ISOBEL: I can't see anything. Just in case, though.  
JAMIE: I think that we better get back. Come on.  
ZOE: Oh Jamie, look! I was right!  
(A silver figure casts a shadow on the curved brick wall.)  
ISOBEL: Fantastic.  
(Isobel steps forward and starts taking photographs.)  
JAMIE: Come on, back.  
(The policeman has climbed down ladder and is shining his torch around.)  
POLICEMAN: Right, you kids, where are you? Come on now, stop playing about.
Are you down there, then?  
(Further along, Isobel is taking pictures.)  
POLICEMAN [OC]: Come on, come on. I know that you're down here somewhere.  
JAMIE: Come on, you're just risking our necks.  
ISOBEL: Just a couple more  
JAMIE: There isn't time. Come on! Out.  
(The policeman has gone a different direction from our group.)  
POLICEMAN: Come on, come on. You'll get lost if you go wandering about down
there. Come on. What the heck?  
(Two Cyberman stand in front of the policeman. One uses its chest unit to kill
him.)  
ISOBEL: The policeman!  
ZOE: They've killed him!  
JAMIE: Right, come on!  
ZOE: Oh, Jamie, no!  
JAMIE: What?  
ZOE: Don't you realise? We can't go back that way.  
JAMIE: And we can't go that way. That Cyberman's after. Yes, they're coming at
us from both directions.  
(The Cyberman behind them is the one that Vaughn has made crazed with fear.)

__**Episode Six**__

**[Fore Street]**

(Another jeep has arrived. Benton is at the open manhole.)  
BENTON: Down here sir.  
TURNER: Sergeant, get the torch.

**[Sewers]**

ZOE: What are we going to do?  
JAMIE: Back! Against the wall!  
(Jamie shields Zoe and Isobel, but the demented Cyberman goes straight past
them, wailing.)  
ZOE: He ignored us.  
JAMIE: It's out of control. It's sort of wild.  
(At the bottom of the manhole, armed soldiers are gathering. The demented
Cyberman can be heard.)  
WALTERS: (sotto) Come on, lads, let's hurry it up.  
BENTON: What's that noise, sir?  
TURNER: I don't know. Come on, let's try this way. (a little way along)
Isobel, where are you? Jamie?  
(Further along.)  
TURNER [OC]: This is Captain Turner! Where are you?  
ISOBEL: That's him. Somebody's coming. I told you.  
JAMIE: No, wait. There are Cybermen between us, remember.  
ISOBEL: What are we going to do? We just can't wait here. Some more might come
along.  
TURNER [OC]: Are you down there?  
ISOBEL: Look, at least let him know we're here.  
JAMIE: Aye, and the other Cybermen too.  
(Back with the soldiers.)  
TURNER: Not a sound.  
WALTERS: Reckon they copped it as well, sir?  
TURNER: Can't be sure, that's the trouble.  
WALTERS: Aye, these sewers are a right maze. They could be anywhere.  
TURNER: Yes. We'd better get in touch with the Brigadier immediately.  
(They turn to head back.)  
TURNER: What the? WALTERS: Sir, what  
(The pair of Cybermen are coming up the tunnel.)  
TURNER: Move back, all of you slowly.  
CYBERMAN: Do not move!  
TURNER: Sergeant, grenades.  
WALTERS: Yes, sir.  
CYBERMAN: Do not resist. You will obey instructions.  
TURNER: What do you want us to do?  
CYBERMAN: You will come with us. Obey.  
(Walters hands a grenade to Turner.)  
WALTERS: Ready sir.  
CYBERMAN: Obey or you will be destroyed.  
(The demented Cyberman comes up behind the pair as Walters prepares to throw
his grenade.)  
TURNER: Wait.  
(The pair turn to deal with their flailing brother.)  
TURNER: Now!  
(Turner and Walters throw their grenades.)  
TURNER: Get down!  
(Boom, Boom. One Cyberman gets up again.)  
TURNER: And again, Sergeant.  
WALTERS: Grenade, quick! Come on, Perkins, Come on.  
PERKINS: It's too late, Sergeant. I'm getting out!  
(Private Perkins runs away.)  
TURNER: Perkins! Come back, man!  
(The Cyberman uses its chest unit on Perkins, killing him. Further along -)  
ISOBEL: Oh, at least we should have warned them.  
(Boom. Boom. Boom.)  
TURNER [OC]: Isobel, Jamie, Zoe! Are you down there?  
JAMIE, ZOE + ISOBEL: Yes!  
ISOBEL: Yes, we are!  
TURNER [OC]: Get to the ladder as quickly as you can.  
JAMIE: Right.  
(By the ladder.)  
TURNER: Come on, hurry it up. Come on, Sergeant, keep those men moving. Get
the body here quickly.  
ISOBEL: Oh, thank goodness.  
TURNER: Shut up! Come on, get out of here and keep out of the way. I've
already lost one man and I don't want to lose anymore. Now up that ladder. Get
moving! Jamie, are there any more behind you?  
JAMIE: No.  
TURNER: Good. Right, get the body up. Jamie, keep a good look out. I think one
of those Cybermen is still alive.

**[Fore Street]**

(Jamie is the last man out.)  
TURNER: Quickly! All right, I'm with you.  
(But a silver hand grabs Jamie's ankle as he gets out.)  
JAMIE: My leg!  
TURNER: All right. Hold on, Jamie!  
(The Cyberman struggles with both Jamie and Turner.)  
TURNER: Sergeant!  
(Walters grabs a rifle and hits the Cyberman with the butt repeatedly.
Eventually it lets go of Jamie and goes back down the ladder.)  
WALTERS: That's it. Got it, got it.  
TURNER: Benton, grenade!  
BENTON [OC]: Coming, sir!  
TURNER: Quick, man!  
WALTERS: Hurry!  
(Benton pulls the pin from a grenade and drops it down the manhole. Boom!)  
WALTERS: I just don't believe it, sir. All them grenades and he still came out
of it.  
TURNER: Yes. Come on, let's get out of here.

**[Laboratory]**

(In Travers' house, the Doctor is peering into a microscope.)  
BRIGADIER: Any success?  
DOCTOR: No, not yet. There's an alien logic in these circuits but I haven't
been able to work it out yet.  
BRIGADIER: So we're no further ahead.  
DOCTOR: No, not yet.  
BRIGADIER: Miss Watkins is developing her photographs. I'm taking a full
report to Geneva and UNIT Central Command.  
DOCTOR: How long will that take?  
BRIGADIER: Depends. I leave in the morning. If I can get the report to the
Council tomorrow we should get some action within two or three days.  
DOCTOR: But that might be too late!  
(Isobel enters.)  
ISOBEL: Here we are. Some beauties.  
(Jamie and Zoe enter. Isobel shows her prints to the Brigadier.)  
BRIGADIER: Yes.  
ISOBEL: What's the matter?  
BRIGADIER: Nothing. They're very good. I don't want to hurt your professional
pride, Miss Watkins, but they do look a little like fakes.  
ISOBEL: Fakes?  
(The photographs are blurred.)  
ZOE: Yes, I see what you mean.  
ISOBEL: Oh, charming, I don't know why I bothered.  
(Isobel leaves.)  
JAMIE: Of course they're Cybermen. Any fool can see that.  
BRIGADIER: Well, you do, McCrimmon.  
JAMIE: Eh?  
BRIGADIER: You know them.  
JAMIE: Oh.  
BRIGADIER: The people I'm trying to convince are a little more sceptical.  
DOCTOR: Yes of course!  
JAMIE: What?  
BRIGADIER: What?  
DOCTOR: It could be, it just could be.

**[Vaughn's office]**

PACKER: It was definitely the UNIT force. They attacked three Cybermen and
destroyed two of them.  
VAUGHN: How very clever of them.  
PACKER: They got out alive. Now if they report on what they saw  
VAUGHN: Their reports will be meaningless, Packer. In a few hours time the
invasion will be complete. There cannot possibly be any serious opposition.  
PACKER: Well, I hope you're right.  
VAUGHN: I am, Packer, I am. Just look at it out there. Soon we shall control
all that. Has the Professor completed his work on the Cerebraton Mentor
machine?  
PACKER: Yes. Gregory's bringing him now.  
(Door bell.)  
PACKER: That'll be them.  
(Packer opens the door. Watkins is carrying the box, Gregory and a guard right
behind him.)  
VAUGHN: Ah, come in gentlemen. Well, Gregory, success?  
GREGORY: I don't know yet, sir. We've added narrow bandwidth transducers.
Should make transmission more directional.  
VAUGHN: Good, good. Show me.  
WATKINS: This is madness. That machine is a deadly weapon now.  
VAUGHN: Really?  
WATKINS: The modifications were quite unnecessary. It worked perfectly well as
it was.  
VAUGHN: For your purposes, perhaps, Professor. I have a somewhat different use
for it.  
WATKINS: All right, all right. Do with it what you will. The machine's yours
now. Now, will you let me get out of this place? And let Isobel go free as you
promise?  
VAUGHN: But my dear fellow, she is free.  
WATKINS: Free? Where? Where is she?  
VAUGHN: Probably sitting quite comfortably at home. Now then, how does one
operate this?  
GREGORY: Careful, Mister Vaughn. Don't point it at anyone.  
VAUGHN: No? Dangerous is it? Fear, Watkins. Do you know what fear is?  
WATKINS: No, don't! Don't do that! Don't!  
(Vaughn switches the machine on with its trumpet pointing at Watkins, who
tenses up in pain and fear.)  
GREGORY: Mister Vaughn, you'll kill him! Stop!  
VAUGHN: Perhaps we should try the effects of the machine on you, Gregory! At
full power!  
GREGORY: No, no, Mister Vaughn. I was only afraid that if we still needed the
Professor  
VAUGHN: I'm aware of that. Unfortunately I suppose that I still need you,
otherwise I. (to guard) Pick him up.  
(Gregory and the guard hold Watkins up.)  
VAUGHN: Professor, you'll be taken back to the factory compound. I want these
machines on the production lines immediately. Do you understand?  
WATKINS: Vaughn, obviously I can't choose but to work for you. If I refuse,
you'll torture me or kill me. I know I can't stand up to torture, and I don't
want to die. You're an evil man, Vaughn. You're sadistic. You're a
megalomaniac. You're insane. I pity you, but if I get half a chance, I'll kill
you.  
VAUGHN: Kill me? Would you? Give me your gun, Packer.  
(Shades of Richard III by Shakespeare. Packer gives Vaughn his pistol. Vaughn
points it at Watkin's head then turns it round and offers it to the little
man.)  
VAUGHN: Take it. There you are. Take it.  
(Vaughn puts the gun in Watkins' hand. Gregory and Packer and the guard back
away.)  
VAUGHN: Now you're free to shoot me, Professor. Shoot. Shoot!  
(Vaughn knocks Watkins down.)  
VAUGHN: Come on, the gun's loaded, or haven't you got the courage to pull the
trigger?  
(Watkins gets up and fires three times, point blank, then faints. Vaughn has
three smoking holes in his shirt, but is standing there laughing.)  
VAUGHN: Take him away. Get work started on the machine immediately.

**[Laboratory]**

(Isobel enters with three mugs on a tray. Turner looks around and smiles.)  
ISOBEL: Tea, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.  
(Jamie is sleeping in a chair.)  
ISOBEL: Jamie. Jamie, tea.  
(She puts his mug on the floor.)  
TURNER: Captain Turner calling UNIT Control. Captain Turner calling UNIT
Control. How do you read me, over?  
WALTERS [OC]: UNIT Control. Loud and clear, sir. Over.  
TURNER: Relay all important messages and reports direct through to here,
Sergeant. Over.  
WALTERS [OC]: Wilco. Over.  
TURNER: Good. Over and out. Thanks.  
ISOBEL: I'm forgiven then?  
TURNER: What?  
ISOBEL: For being such a twit and going down those sewers. I'm sorry about the
soldier.  
TURNER: Yes, well, it's all right. You weren't to know what you were really
letting yourself in for.  
ISOBEL: Why, I would have got us all killed. I just didn't realise. I mean,
those Cybermen things. I've just been listening to Zoe telling the Brigadier
all about them for his report, and they really do sound as murderous as they
look.  
TURNER: You know, we dropped five grenades right on top of them and one of
them still came out of it. I'd hate to have to fight a whole army of them.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no!  
JAMIE: What's the matter, Doctor? Would someone mind telling me what's going
on?  
TURNER: Don't worry, Jamie. Finish your tea and go back to sleep.  
WALTERS [OC]: UNIT Control to CO. UNIT Control to CO. Over.  
TURNER: Captain Turner here, Sergeant. Stand by. Isobel, will you get the
Brigadier for me?  
ISOBEL: Oh, sure.  
(ISOBEL runs out of the room.)  
TURNER: Brigadier's on his way now, Sergeant. What's the flap? Over.  
WALTERS [OC]: Report from Red sector one, sir, at twenty thirty hours  
(Isobel meets the Brigadier at the door.)  
TURNER: Hold on a sec. Right, the Brigadier's listening now. Go ahead,
Sergeant.  
WALTERS [OC]: Benton on routine observation reports two guards and another man
leaving with the Professor. He's on their tail now, sir. Over.  
TURNER: Hold on, Sergeant. Look, sir, we could intercept and release the
Professor.  
BRIGADIER: Well, officially we  
ISOBEL: Oh do. Please, do.  
DOCTOR: Brigadier, if you could rescue him, he might be able to help us with
our problem.  
BRIGADIER: All right. Your shindig Jimmy.  
TURNER: Sergeant, tell Benton to stay with them. I'm on my way now. I'll
contact him on route. Over.  
WALTERS [OC]: Wilco. Over.  
BRIGADIER: Jimmy, don't take any chances. Vaughn's lot know we mean business
so they won't be playing games.  
TURNER: No, sir, neither will I. I'll take the full assault platoon with me.  
BRIGADIER: Right.  
TURNER: Sergeant, alert the full assault platoon. I'll relay instructions on
route. Have you got that, over?  
WALTERS [OC]: Yes, sir. Over.  
TURNER: Good. Over and out.  
ISOBEL: Good luck.  
TURNER: Thanks.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, good luck, Jimmy.  
TURNER: Sir. (Turner leaves.)  
TURNER: I think Mister Vaughn is going to have quite a scrap on his hands.

**[Vaughn's office]**

GREGORY: There were at least thirty of them, all UNIT men and all armed,
Mister Vaughn. We didn't stand a chance. Out of nowhere. They just came out of
nowhere.  
VAUGHN: And they just took the Professor?  
GREGORY: What could we do? There were at least  
VAUGHN: Thirty of them, you say?  
GREGORY: It was hopeless. They shot the two guards, and they'd have shot me if  
VAUGHN: If you hadn't run away.  
GREGORY: Well, yes.  
VAUGHN: You realise of course that without the Professor's assistance it will
not be possible to get the Cerebraton Machine on the production line.  
GREGORY: No, Mister Vaughn, I can. Given a little time, I'm sure I can!  
VAUGHN: But you have no time, Gregory. No time at all.

**[Sewers]**

PACKER: Kill him!  
(Two Cybermen use their chest units on the fleeing Gregory.)

**[Laboratory]**

WATKINS: I'm sorry. I can't tell you.  
DOCTOR: (You've no idea what these micro-monolithic circuits are for.  
WATKINS: No.  
DOCTOR: Oh, my word.  
WATKINS: I couldn't understand why Vaughn wanted the modifications to the
machine.  
DOCTOR: You say he's going to mass produce these machines?  
WATKINS: Yes.  
BRIGADIER: Why should he want a weapon like that if he's got the Cybermen to
fight for him?  
DOCTOR: I've no idea. Unless. Professor! You say that you developed this
machine to produce excessively powerful emotional pulses.  
WATKINS: Yes, that's true.  
DOCTOR: Well, that's it! Vaughn going to use it as a weapon against the
Cybermen once he has no further use for them.  
BRIGADIER: What, the Professor's machine?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Emotion is alien to the Cybermen's nervous system. It'll destroy
it. The micro-monolithic circuits. They're emotional circuits! No wonder they
weren't logical. Now why didn't I think of this before. Now, let's see.  
(The Doctor goes to the microscope.)  
JAMIE: Now what's he up to?  
ZOE: I've no idea.  
WATKINS: Doctor. Doctor.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, look, Jimmy, I'd better get back to Control. I leave for
Geneva at dawn. If the Doctor should come up with anything, let me know.  
TURNER: Right, sir.  
JAMIE: Oh. Oh well, if anything exciting happens, wake me up, will you? I was
in the middle of a lovely dream.  
ZOE: Honestly, Jamie. Cybermen underneath London and all you can think about
is your sleep.  
(More pairs of Cybermen are dispersing through the sewers. Some of them are
carrying ray guns. Later - )  
ZOE: Jamie. Jamie, wake up.  
JAMIE: Och, there's no peace. What is it?  
ZOE: The Doctor discovered something important. Come on!  
DOCTOR: Let's hope it isn't. Oh, how do you do, Jamie? Now then, here is the
Earth. And here is the Moon.  
(The Doctor points to a rough drawing he has made on a piece of board.)  
DOCTOR: And these are the communication satellites circling the Earth. And
here is the Cybermen's spaceship, the invasion spaceship, the one that we saw.
Right, now if I'm right, I think that this will come to this side of the Moon
and boost signals to the Earth.  
WATKINS: The signals will activate these circuits.  
DOCTOR: Precisely.  
ZOE: But you still haven't told us what that will do.  
DOCTOR: The micro-monolithic circuits are artificial nervous systems. Once
activated they will produce the Cyber-hypnotic force that controls human
beings.  
TURNER: But there are hundreds, thousands of these circuits in IE equipment
all over the world.  
WATKINS: Exactly.  
ISOBEL: So everybody will come under their control.  
ZOE: Yes, the Cybermen will take over everybody.  
TURNER: Well, isn't there anything we can do?  
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a way to block the signals, isn't there, Zoe.  
ZOE: The depolariser. Worn at the back of the neck, it will jam the Cyber-
control waves.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Have you any neuristors here, Professor?  
WATKINS: Well, a few, I think.  
DOCTOR: Zoe, I want you to show the Professor what to do. The invasion could
come at any moment.

**[Vaughn's office]**

(A buzzer sounds. Vaughn opens the secret panel.)  
PLANNER: Is all in readiness?  
VAUGHN: Of course.  
PLANNER: There is one hour to invasion time. Countdown will start from now.  
VAUGHN: Excellent.  
PLANNER: We are moving into position now. Ready to transmit the Cyber-signal.  

**[Laboratory]**

DOCTOR: Brigadier, they must all be fitted once. The invasion could come at
any moment.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: I'll get all UNIT groups onto it as soon as possible, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Good. Good. If you want any help, just call me up.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Will do. Out.  
DOCTOR: Now then, now many have you made, Zoe?  
ZOE: Only three, I'm afraid. We couldn't find any more neuristors.  
DOCTOR: What? There must be some more amongst all this gubbins. Come on, let's
have a look. We must protect everyone here at least. Now search, everybody.
Come along.

**[Vaughn's office]**

PLANNER: We are proceeding to our position now. Transmitter will be ready in
thirty minutes.  
(Packer enters.)  
VAUGHN: A few minutes, Packer. A few minutes and then I shall control the
world.  
PACKER: You? You're sure?  
VAUGHN: Quite certain, Packer. Quite certain.

**[Isobel's room]**

(Daybreak in London. Stock photographs of Australia House, St Pauls Cathedral
as birds sing.)  
TURNER: Penny for them?  
ISOBEL: It's all so peaceful.  
TURNER: Do you think the Doctor could be wrong this time? I mean about the
invasion.  
ISOBEL: Well, he's been right up to now.  
TURNER: Yes, true, but, well, I don't know. Look.  
ISOBEL: Yeah, I know what you mean. Why, it's just incredible, isn't it?
Looking at all that peace out there, it's so difficult to imagine.  
(An electronic sound starts up.)  
ISOBEL: What's that noise?

**[Laboratory]**

(Fashion note - Zoe is back in the glitter cat suit. The Doctor grabs the back
of his neck.)  
DOCTOR: Zoe, my depolariser. It must have fallen off!  
(The Doctor collapses.)  
ZOE: Oh Professor, get a depolarizer, quickly.  
(A businessman walking along Distaff Lane grabs at the concrete lattice wall.
A woman puts her hands over her ears. A car driver passes out, resting on the
horn. A man cleaning the gates of the College of Arms looks up in horror.)  
ZOE: Quickly!  
(Zoe puts a depolariser on the back of the Doctor's neck.)  
ZOE: Doctor! Doctor!  
ISOBEL: Is he all right?  
ZOE: I don't know.  
ISOBEL: Oh, whatever is that noise?  
JAMIE [OC]: Doctor? Doctor!  
(Jamie and Turner enter.)  
JAMIE: Hey!  
ISOBEL: What is it? What's happened?  
TURNER: It's the Cybermen. We've just seen hundreds coming out of the sewers.  
(Cybermen march down St Peter's Steps, along Knightrider Street and Queen
Victoria Street as the Cyber-signal hypnotises the humans.)

__**Episode Seven**__

**[Laboratory]**

(The Doctor starts to wake up, groaning.)  
ISOBEL: Oh, are you all right, Doctor?  
JAMIE: Doctor! The invasion, it's begun.  
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, I rather gathered that. Is everyone else all right?  
ALL: Yes.  
ISOBEL: We're fine.  
DOCTOR: Oh, what about the Brigadier, and the rest of the men?  
TURNER: I'll check.  
JAMIE: Are you all right to stand up now?  
ISOBEL: Come on, up you get.  
TURNER: Captain Turner calling UNIT Control. Captain Turner calling UNIT
Control. Are you receiving me? Over. Are you receiving me? Over,  
WALTERS [OC]: UNIT control receiving you. Over.  
TURNER: Sergeant, is the Brigadier there?  
WALTERS [OC]: Hold on a moment, sir.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Here, Jimmy. Are you all right?  
TURNER: Yes, sir.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Well, chaos here. Only half the crew recovered so far.  
DOCTOR: Brigadier, what about the rest of the UNIT men?  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Well, hard to say. Reports still coming in. Look, I'll send
transport for you. You'll be safer here with us.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Jimmy?  
DOCTOR: Jamie?  
TURNER: Yes, sir, I heard.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Right. Now stay put. As far as I can gather, the streets are
packed with Cybermen. Sergeant Walters will try to get through with a jeep.  
TURNER: Right, sir. Over and out. Well, sounds like total success for Vaughn
and the Cybermen.  
DOCTOR: Yes. We appear to be sitting right in the middle of the hornet's nest.

**[Vaughn's office]**

(Vaughn is writing on a clipboard.)  
PLANNER: All areas are now covered by our transmission. The full invasion
force is preparing for flight. Transmit the radio beam for the transporter
ships to home on.  
VAUGHN: It will be prepared.  
PLANNER: Control and supervision of Cybermen in all key positions will be
arranged. Prepare your communication network.  
VAUGHN: Wait. My organisation will now take over. The Cyberman army must stay
under my control.  
PLANNER: Why do you oppose us.  
VAUGHN: I don't oppose you. We're allies. But you do not understand the world
and it's organisation. I do.  
PLANNER: This is not necessary. Humans are now under Cyber-control.  
VAUGHN: I must control them! Look, let's understand one another. You will not
get what you want unless I too achieve my object. Is this agreed?  
PLANNER: It has been agreed.  
VAUGHN: Good! Then the invasion will continue under my direction. Discussion
terminated.  
(Vaughn closes the secret panel.)  
VAUGHN: Packer!  
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes sir.  
VAUGHN: Have you discovered where the Professor is?  
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, Mister Vaughn.  
VAUGHN :Go and collect him.  
PACKER [on monitor]: But sir, the UNIT people.  
VAUGHN: You won't meet with any resistance. They're all under Cyber-control.  
PACKER [on monitor]: Right, Mister Vaughn.  
VAUGHN: I want work started on the production of the machines immediately. Go
and recapture Watkins. Don't let anything or anyone stop you.

**[Hallway]**

(An army jeep pulls up in front of Travers' house. Walters grabs a rifle, runs
up to the front door and rings the bell. Turner lets him in, pistol ready.)  
WALTERS: Oh, thanks, sir.  
TURNER: Thank goodness you made it. Any trouble?  
WALTERS: Hundreds of Cybermen about, sir.  
TURNER: Well, the sooner we get out of here, the better. Everybody ready?  
ALL [OC] Yes!  
ISOBEL [OC]: Ready, we're coming.  
WALTERS: Listen!  
(Turner looks outside as an IE jeep screeches to a halt across the road.)  
TURNER: We've had the jeep. We'd better get out of here, out of the back way
as quickly as possible.  
WALTERS: Right!  
TURNER: Come on, move, everybody. Quickly! Out of the back door. Hurry it up.
Come on Jamie. Professor, all right? Good.  
(Watkins is carrying the R/T. A rifle barrel smashes the glass in the front
door and he is shot.)  
WATKINS: My leg!  
(Turner fires two shots then his pistol jams.)  
TURNER: Come on, Jamie. Get the radio out of here.  
JAMIE: Right.  
TURNER: Leave the Professor to me.  
JAMIE: Okay. Have you got him?  
TURNER: Yes. Right, I've got him.  
JAMIE: Right.  
TURNER: Come on.  
(Three more shots come through the front door and Jamie is hit but manages to
stagger to the back of the house.)

**[Aeroplane]**

BRIGADIER: Yes, Jimmy, where are you?  
TURNER [OC]: In bother, sir. We need help. Can you give us a chopper.  
BRIGADIER: Yes. Can you make sector five?  
TURNER [OC]: We can try, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Right, I'll get the chopper there. Out. UNIT Control calling sector
five chopper. Over.  
PILOT [OC]: Receiving you. Over.  
BRIGADIER: This is the Brigadier. Are you airborne?  
PILOT [OC]: Yes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Right. Proceed to sector five and pick up Captain Turner and party,
and bring them here.  
PILOT [OC]: Wilco. Out.

**[Vaughn's office]**

VAUGHN: How could they escape the Cyber-control?  
PACKER: It's that Doctor, something to do with him. You should have got rid of
him when you had the chance.  
VAUGHN: Shut up, Packer! I must go on with the invasion.  
PACKER: But what about the Professor? Without him, we can't make any more
machines. Without machines we can't control the Cybermen.  
VAUGHN: Let me worry about that. For the moment, I have the Cybermen exactly
where I want them.  
PACKER: Yeah, but for how long? Now, can you honestly say that everything's
going according to plan, that nothing's been overlooked? Well, can you?  
VAUGHN: Just obey my orders! Now, get in touch with the compound and have the
radio beam projected. The invasion fleet must be brought in.

**[Aeroplane]**

(In flight.)  
WALTERS: New York's off the air, sir. Moscow's dead and Peking. In fact,
nothing. No radio communication at all.  
BRIGADIER: Right, Sergeant. Keep trying all frequencies.  
WALTERS: Yes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: It seems to be a total blanket all over the world.  
TURNER: Look, couldn't we make hundreds of these neuristor things, sir, and
distribute them.  
BRIGADIER: I doubt there's time for that Jimmy. What do you think, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I agree. The Cybermen will attack in force now. There must be
thousands of them in outer space.  
BRIGADIER: Is there nothing we can do?  
DOCTOR: Not unless we can stop the Cyber-control signals.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, but if your theory's right, they'll be coming from somewhere
near the moon. That means we're going to need a missile of some sort.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid it does.  
TURNER: That would need an orbital launch vehicle. We simply haven't got
anything of that size.  
BRIGADIER: No, only the Americans and the Russians have. Wait a minute.  
(Lethbridge-Stewart gets thick lever binder from a safe.)  
BRIGADIER: I seem to remember reading. Ah, yes, yes, here we are. The Russians
were planning a countdown at the time we were attacked.  
TURNER: For the moon, sir?  
BRIGADIER: Yes, a manned orbital survey. That means they'll have a launching
vehicle almost ready to go.  
TURNER: You mean we could put a warhead on it, in place of the astronaut
capsule?  
BRIGADIER: It's a possibility.  
DOCTOR: How long would all this take?  
BRIGADIER: Well, we could get a small party there in about two hours. Of
course, we'll have to revive the rocket personnel from Cyber-control. After
that, well, that'd be up to the Russians.  
TURNER: It means it's all a question of time. How long do you think we have,
Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm surprised they're not here already.  
BRIGADIER: Jimmy, here's the gen on the Russian rocket base. You deal with
that.  
TURNER: All right, sir.  
BRIGADIER: And get your skates on.  
TURNER: Yes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Now, Doctor, we must deal with this invasion you say is coming.  
DOCTOR: Yes, at least we know where they'll land. They'll home in on Vaughn's
radio signal.  
BRIGADIER: Would we be able to pick them off with anti-missile missiles?  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a good idea. We might have a try.  
BRIGADIER: Right. There's a base near Henlow Downs. Just a minute. Sergeant
Walters?  
(Zoe enters.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, Zoe, sit down. It's a big bumpy. Now, how's Jamie's leg?  
ZOE: Oh, it's just a slight flesh wound. But he's furious because the Army
doctor won't let him walk on it.  
DOCTOR: Well, he would be, wouldn't he. How's the Professor?  
ZOE: Oh, he'll be all right, Isobel's with him. Anything I can do, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Well I suggest that you go with the Brigadier. Much as I detest
computers, I think that remarkable brain of yours will come in very handy.  
ZOE: Right. What are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: I think it's about time I had a serious talk with our Mister Vaughn.  
ZOE: What, go back? But he'd kill you as soon as look at you.  
DOCTOR: No, we need time if we're going to stop this attack, and I think I can
get us that time.  
BRIGADIER: No, this is madness, I can't afford to let you take that risk.  
DOCTOR: You can't afford not to, Brigadier. If you're going to attack the
Cybermen with missiles, they're going to retaliate, and we want to know how
and with what.  
ZOE: But how can you find that out?  
DOCTOR: I'll leave my radio on, and then you'll hear every word that passes
between me and Vaughn.  
BRIGADIER: But you'll never get near the place. The whole area will be
crawling with Cybermen.  
DOCTOR: Oh, there's one particular place where there'll be no Cybermen.  
BRIGADIER: Where's that?  
DOCTOR: In the sewers.  
WALTERS: We're coming in to land, sir.

**[Airfield]**

(The Brigadier and Zoe watch as the Doctor drives a Land Rover out of the
Hercules.)  
DOCTOR: Bye bye.  
(He drives away. Captain Turner comes down with another one.)  
BRIGADIER: All set, Jimmy?  
TURNER: Yes, sir. I've got a hypersonic jet laid on. We'll be in Russia in no
time.  
BRIGADIER: Splendid.  
ZOE: Good luck.  
TURNER: Thank you.

**[Aeroplane]**

WALTERS: All sections prepare for take-off. Secure loading bay and stand by in
flight positions. All UNIT ground section leaders stand by on full alert
readiness.  
BRIGADIER: Sergeant Walters, ask Wing Commander Robbins to bring us down at
the nearest airstrip to Henlow Downs Defence base.  
WALTERS: Yes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, and Sergeant, make sure that a chopper stays in Red sector one
area. The Doctor might need it in a hurry.

**[Sewers]**

DOCTOR: (sotto) UNIT control. This is the Doctor. Is the Brigadier there,
please?  
WALTERS [OC]: Hold on a moment, sir. I'll get him.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Yes, Doctor, go ahead.  
DOCTOR: Brigadier, I've just entered the sewers. I'm going to make my way to
Vaughn's headquarters. I'll give you a call when I get there.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Right. We'll have a chopper in the area in case you get in
trouble.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
(The Doctor puts the radio in his inside pocket then tosses a coin to decide
which way he should go.)

**[Aeroplane]**

ZOE: But your helicopter isn't going to be much use to the Doctor if he does
meet any Cybermen down in those sewers.  
BRIGADIER: If you've got any better suggestions, I'll be pleased to hear them.  
WALTERS: Excuse me, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Yes.  
WALTERS: Captain Turner's airborne. ETA over Russia two hours seven minutes
from takeoff.  
BRIGADIER: Good. Keep the Doctor's channel open and let me know the moment he
contacts you.  
WALTERS: Yes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Well, don't look so worried. Fancy a cup of tea?

**[Vaughn's office]**

PACKER: With particularly heavy concentrations here, here, here, and here.  
VAUGHN: And all the main communication centres are now manned by our forces?  
PACKER: Yes, but, er  
VAUGHN: What? But what, Packer?  
PACKER: Well, we can't make a complete takeover without the full invasion
force.  
VAUGHN: They'll arrive, Packer, they'll arrive. And when they do, there won't
be one city in the entire world that we don't control. Think of it, Packer,
the entire world!  
(An alarm sounds.)  
PACKER: It's the security alarm. The UNIT forces must have  
VAUGHN: Packer!  
(Vaughn goes through the security camera views until - .)  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Oh, there you are. Can you hear me, Mister Vaughn?  
VAUGHN: Yes?  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: I hope I haven't called at an inconvenient moment, but I
would rather like a word with you.  
VAUGHN: Clever of you to avoid our Cyber-control beam.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Oh, it was nothing. I'll come up. I know the way.  
(Transmission ends.)  
PACKER: He must be out of his mind.  
VAUGHN: Far from it, Packer. Have the guards search the building, just in case
he's brought any friends with him.  
PACKER: Why not just kill him? He's caused enough trouble already.  
VAUGHN: You forget, Packer. He's our insurance.

**[Aeroplane]**

(Lethbridge-Stewart is strapping on his gun belt.)  
WALTERS: Approaching Henlow airstrip now, sir. Two minutes to touchdown.  
BRIGADIER: Fine. Tell the raiding party to stand by.  
WALTERS: Yes, sir.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Brigadier. Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor, go ahead.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Ah. I'm just about to enter the lion's den. I will leave the
radio on as from now.  
BRIGADIER: Right. Good luck.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Thank you.  
BRIGADIER: Keep that channel open and get the whole thing on tape.  
WALTERS: Yes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: If he yells for help while I'm away, send in everything we've got
to get him out.  
WALTERS: Right.  
VAUGHN [OC]: Ah Doctor, what an unexpected pleasure. Do come in.

**[Vaughn's office]**

DOCTOR: And you trust them?  
VAUGHN: Doctor, I've worked with the Cybermen for five years preparing this
invasion. I know them, the way they think, the single-mindedness of their
purpose.  
DOCTOR: Then you must know what ruthless and inhuman killers they are.  
VAUGHN: Of course. But then, they are my allies, not my enemies.  
DOCTOR: Do you really think they'll honour any bargain that you make with
them?  
VAUGHN: Oh, I've planned this whole operation in great detail, allowing for
every possible factor. It was I who contacted them in deep space, provided the
means by which they travelled to Earth, and masterminded the whole operation
from A to Z. They have merely provided their advanced scientific skills, their
might and strength.  
DOCTOR: What do they get out of all this?  
VAUGHN: What they want, and what they're going to get, are two entirely
different things.  
DOCTOR: Oh, you're a fool, Vaughn. When they get here, they'll take over.  
VAUGHN: All Cybermen here are conditioned to obey my orders. They are directly
under my command.  
DOCTOR: Oh, possibly. But what about the others, out there in space? Are they
conditioned to obey your commands?  
VAUGHN: If they're not, I'll destroy them.  
DOCTOR: With the Professor's machine?  
VAUGHN: Yes.  
DOCTOR: With one machine?  
VAUGHN: I'll have more made.  
DOCTOR: But you'll have to have the Professor's help to do that, won't you?
We've got the Professor.  
VAUGHN: They'll be under my command, exactly like the others.  
DOCTOR: But you can't be sure of that, can you?

**[Henlow Downs]**

(Everyone here is out cold when Lethbridge-Stewart, Zoe and two soldiers
enter.)  
BRIGADIER: Get all these men fitted with neuristors, and put the radio over
there.  
(Zoe starts on the nearest man).  
BRIGADIER: UNIT Control, UNIT Control, how do you read me? Over.  
WALTERS [OC]: Loud and clear, sir. Over.  
BRIGADIER: Any trouble?  
WALTERS [OC]: No, sir. Captain Turner reports they're over the Russian border
now, sir. Over.  
ZOE: How about the Doctor?  
BRIGADIER: Sergeant, how about the Doctor?  
WALTERS [OC]: So far, so good, sir. Over.  
BRIGADIER: Right. Out.  
(The men with new neuristers start to wake.).  
BRIGADIER: Take it easy, Major.  
BRANWELL: What happened? Were we, were we attacked?  
BRIGADIER: Now just try and clear your head. There's a great deal to be done.

**[Vaughn's office]**

DOCTOR: But you daren't take the risk! Once the Cybermen take over, they'll
destroy the Earth as we know it!  
VAUGHN: You're just playing for time, aren't you?  
DOCTOR: I'm trying to stop you from destroying the human race!  
VAUGHN: Your UNIT friends. You presumably managed to protect them from the
Cyber-control as well? What are they planning?  
DOCTOR: I don't know what you're talking about.  
VAUGHN: Packer?  
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, sir.  
VAUGHN: Is the radio beam in the compound aligned yet?  
PACKER [on monitor]: Yes, sir. It's all ready.  
VAUGHN: Good. Then link the beam to the invasion fleet.  
PACKER [on monitor]: Right, Mister Vaughn.  
VAUGHN: Whatever it is your UNIT friends are trying to do, it's too late.

**[Henlow Downs]**

BRANWELL: But this is fantastic. Unbelievable.  
BRIGADIER: Nevertheless true. We believe they'll be sending their full
invasion fleet at any time. If they get here, we've had it.  
BRANWELL: I see, sir. Sergeant Peters?  
PETERS: Sir.  
BRANWELL: Anything on the scope?  
PETERS: Not a glimmer, sir.  
BRANWELL: Well, sir?  
BRIGADIER: I suppose we could be too late.  
ZOE: What's the maximum range of your radar?  
PETERS: Accurate up to fifty thousand miles, miss. Dodgy after that.  
ZOE: Well, that means we're not likely to pick them up until they're almost on
top of us.  
BRANWELL: Yes, that's true. Well, let's be prepared in case they do appear on
the screens. Sergeant Peters, prepare all launch pads. Begin fuel priming and
start preliminary countdown.  
PETERS: Sir.  
(Pads 1-8 go to stand by, with their triple missile complements swinging up
and round ready to launch.)

**[Vaughn's office]**

PLANNER: The transporters will be launched.  
VAUGHN: It's all arranged.  
PLANNER: The invasion fleet will arrive in two parts.  
DOCTOR: You must stop them! This is madness! You can't trust them!  
VAUGHN: Don't you understand yet? I have no alternative. (sotto) I can't see
all these years of work destroyed. I must go on, I must!

**[Henlow Downs]**

WALTERS [OC]: That's what we hear, sir. The rest of them are on their way.
Over.  
BRANWELL: Something coming in now, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Anything from Captain Turner? Have they landed in Russia yet?  
WALTERS [OC]: They've landed, sir, but we've heard nothing more. Over.  
BRIGADIER: I see. Out.  
PETERS: Sir, it's just on range limits now, sir. Faint yet, but moving in
fast.  
BRIGADIER: Is this it?  
BRANWELL: It looks like it, sir.  
PETERS: More now, sir, look. They're on a ballistic trajectory.  
(A V formation of dots heads towards the middle of the radar screen.)  
ZOE: How long before they'll be within range of your missiles?  
PETERS: At this rate, a couple of minutes at the moment, miss.  
BRANWELL: Sergeant Peters?  
PETERS: Sir!  
BRANWELL: Where are we on countdown?  
PETERS: T minus forty five seconds sir.  
BRANWELL: Hold.  
(Branwell uses the base intercom. The status board has moved from Stand By to
Phasing and Readiness.)  
BRANWELL: Launch crew hear this. Forty five seconds to lift off. Prepare fuse
locks.  
WOMAN [OC]: Fuse locks in preparation. Arming code running.  
BRANWELL: Run co-ordinates programme A theta.  
PETERS: Sir!  
ZOE: There are more of them!  
PETERS: Sir.  
BRANWELL: Sky range probes active. Yes, what is it.  
PETERS: More of them, sir!  
WOMAN [OC]: Arming code run. All warheads ready for lift off activation.  
BRANWELL: Well, we can't get them all. Let's take as many as we can. Lift off
the activation check.  
PETERS: Coordinate programme running sir.  
BRANWELL: Link programme to telemeter guidance.  
PETERS: Roger.  
ZOE: Major, I think we stand a good chance of getting at least ninety percent
of them.  
BRANWELL: How? We haven't got enough missiles.  
ZOE: Oh please, Major. Just knocking out half a dozen of them would do very
little good at all. Let's try for them all.  
BRANWELL: Look, Miss, I know my business and I'm telling you we haven't got
enough missiles.  
ZOE: Yes, you have. These things are coming in in a formation pattern. Now if
you set your missiles carefully you can set up a chain reaction of explosions.  
BRANWELL: No. There isn't time to compute all the relevant information. They'd
be on top of us by then.  
ZOE: Give me thirty seconds.  
BRIGADIER: Give her what she asks, Major. Thirty seconds.  
BRANWELL: But sir, this is ridiculous!  
BRIGADIER: Just thirty seconds.  
BRANWELL: Hold for thirty seconds!  
PETERS: Sir, that doesn't give us much time.  
BRANWELL: All right Sergeant, I know. Countdown to begin T minus forty five
seconds.  
(Zoe grabs a clipboard, takes data from the control panels along the wall and
does some sums.)  
ZOE: Here. Feed this into your computer.  
BRANWELL: Do as she says, now. I'll take over here.  
PETERS: Sir.  
BRANWELL: You'd better be right.  
ZOE: I am.  
BRANWELL: T minus forty five seconds from now.  
PETERS: Information computed, sir. Thank you, miss.  
(Zoe lets Peters sit down again.)  
BRANWELL: Align to telemeter guidance.  
PETERS: Sir. T minus thirty two seconds.  
WOMAN [OC]: Launch crew clear, sir.  
PETERS: Automatic.  
BRANWELL: Yes, all guidance now to computer control. Check.  
PETERS: T minus twenty eight seconds T minus twenty two seconds. Eighteen
seconds  
BRANWELL: No hold-ups, please.  
PETERS: T minus fourteen seconds. Thirteen, twelve. Ten, nine  
(Branwell inserts the firing keys.)  
PETERS: Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, aero.  
(Branwell presses the launch button and the missile clusters hurtle up into
the air, shedding their booster rockets. Once in space, they strike the Cyber-
fleet. KaBOOMs all round.)

**[Vaughn's office]**

PLANNER: The first transporter fleet is being attacked and destroyed. You have
betrayed us.  
VAUGHN: No!  
PLANNER: The failure of this mission is due to you. We will now take over the
invasion.  
VAUGHN: No! Wait! Give me time! I can stop this opposition!  
PLANNER: There is no more time.  
VAUGHN: I won't allow this invasion to  
(Vaughn steps into the Planner's alcove but is stopped and forced back by an
energy wall.)  
PLANNER: We no longer need you. A Cyber-megatron bomb will be delivered. We
must destroy life on Earth completely. Every living being.  
DOCTOR: Is this what you wanted? To be the ruler of a dead world?

__**Episode Eight**__

**[Aeroplane]**

VAUGHN [OC]: You can't do that. You can't destroy the world. What about me?  
PLANNER [OC]: You are of no further use to us. The Cyber-invasion must
succeed. The bomb will be delivered.  
ISOBEL: Hey, you'd better call  
BENTON: UNIT Control calling the Brigadier. UNIT Control calling the
Brigadier. Over.

**[Henlow Downs]**

BRANWELL: Every single one of them, knocked right out of the sky.  
BRIGADIER: Exactly as you predicted, a chain reaction of explosions.  
BRANWELL: It's fantastic. How do you do it?  
ZOE: Well, it's all quite logical really. Hardly any calculation needed at
all. Except for simple stuff like speed, angle of descent and relative
positions of the spaceships.  
PETERS: Can't we keep her on, sir? She's much prettier than a computer.  
BENTON [OC]: Calling the Brigadier.  
BRIGADIER: Quiet, everyone!  
BENTON [OC]: UNIT control calling the Brigadier. Over.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, Sergeant, what's the flap?  
BENTON [OC]: Corporal Benton here, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Benton? Well, what's happened to Sergeant Walters?  
BENTON [OC]: He's taken over the Geneva link, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Oh, I see. Well, what's the flap?  
BENTON [OC]: It's news from the Doctor, sir, just come through on his open
channel. They're going to drop some sort of bomb.  
BRIGADIER: Bomb? You mean the Cyberman are?  
BENTON [OC]: Yes, sir. Something called a Cyber-megatron bomb. They're going
to wipe us all out, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Right, Benton, stand by. We're on our way back. Out. We're moving
out. Keep in touch, Major. We'll keep all radio communication on open network
so that you'll know what's going on.  
BRANWELL: Right sir.  
BRIGADIER: And keep your eyes skinned in case they start sending any more
stuff in. And try and get a fix on that bomb.  
BRANWELL: If we do, sir, we'll try to touch it off on its approach orbit.  
BRIGADIER: Right. Let's go!

**[Vaughn's office]**

VAUGHN: But if you do, you'll destroy everything here. Even your own Cybermen!  
PLANNER: The sacrifice will be small.  
VAUGHN: You can't do this! I won't let you!  
PLANNER: You cannot stop us. No one can.  
DOCTOR: Now you're beginning to understand the Cybermen, Vaughn, you can't
make bargains with them!  
VAUGHN: I won't let them take over. I won't! You think you're indestructible?
Well, I can destroy all of you!  
(Vaughn aims Walter's device at the Planner and turns it on.)  
PLANNER: Opposition is useless. The Cybermen will  
DOCTOR: Vaughn! Switch it off, you'll blow us all sky high!  
VAUGHN: I'll destroy them all! All!  
(The Cyber-Planner goes boom!)  
VAUGHN: It's dead. I killed it. I destroyed it.  
DOCTOR: That won't stop them. They're still out there in space preparing to
destroy the world.  
VAUGHN: Five years, and in less than five seconds!  
DOCTOR: Vaughn, listen to me. The Cybermen will deliver their bomb on the same
radio beam they used for their invasion. You've got to turn it off, man.
You've got to turn it off!  
VAUGHN: What?  
DOCTOR: We're both on the same side now, both fighting for our lives. You've
got to turn the radio beam off!  
VAUGHN: The radio?  
DOCTOR: Yes! That's how they'll deliver their bomb!  
VAUGHN: The radio beam! Yes, yes, Packer must. Packer! Packer! Where are you?  
(A Cyberman appears on the monitor. Packer enters.)  
PACKER: Vaughn! They've taken over! The Cybermen, they won't obey! They've
killed the. They're coming after us. Vaughn, what have you done to us? What
have you done?  
(A Cyberman enters. Packer tries shooting it but is killed by the beam from
its chest unit. The Doctor pops up from behind Vaughn's desk and turns
Walter's device on it. The Cyberman collapses in smoke.)  
DOCTOR: Vaughn, where is the transmitter for the radio beam?  
VAUGHN: We can't fight them. They're too powerful. Too many of them.  
DOCTOR: Oh, don't be a fool, man. Where do we turn it off?  
VAUGHN: At the compound, but they'll be there.  
DOCTOR: Right. We must stop them. Brigadier, Brigadier, this is the Doctor.
Can you still hear me.

**[Aeroplane]**

BRIGADIER: Yes Doctor, we heard everything. What do we do?  
DOCTOR [OC]: There are only two possibilities. We must either cut off the
transmitter of the radio beam at the compound or destroy the Cyberman
spaceship.  
BRIGADIER: How much time do we have?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh, I've no idea, it could be minutes or hours. Depends how long
it'll takes them to prepare this bomb of theirs.  
BRIGADIER: Well, destroying the spaceship is going to take time. Now, we've
heard from Captain Turner. The Russians are with us, but they say it'll take
at least ten hours or more to get a missile that far.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Then there's only one chance. The radio beam. Wait. Vaughn. Now,
Vaughn, will you help us? We must try to get to the controls of the radio
beam. We'll never do it in time unless you help us!

**[Vaughn's office]**

VAUGHN: You still think you have a chance?  
DOCTOR: Yes, if you'll help us!  
VAUGHN: Help you? Why should I?  
DOCTOR: Well, to save us. To save yourself!  
VAUGHN: And if I survive, what future have I got? What will the world do with
me?  
DOCTOR: Oh, for heaven's sake, stop thinking about yourself! Think of the
millions of people on earth who are about to die!  
VAUGHN: Appealing to my better nature? No. If I help you it'll be because I
hate them. The Cybermen, my allies. You think I'm mad, that all I want is
power for its own sake. No, I have to have power. The world is weak,
vulnerable, a mess of uncoordinated and impossible ideals. It needs a strong
man, a single mind. A leader!  
DOCTOR: Vaughn, will you listen?  
VAUGHN: Right. I'll help you to destroy them because I hate them. They
destroyed my dream.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Brigadier?  
BRIGADIER [OC]: We have a chopper in the area. Can you get up to the roof?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, we'll wait there for you.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Wilco. Out.  
VAUGHN: Your UNIT friends are very efficient. I'll lead the way to the roof.  
(The Doctor picks up Walter's device.)  
VAUGHN: No, no, no, I'll take that. The Cybermen will be guarding the radio
transmitter.  
DOCTOR: Oh, dear.

**[Aeroplane]**

BRIGADIER: Brigadier to Wing Commander. Get us airborne and head for the
nearest airstrip to the compound area. Red sector two.  
WING COMMANDER [OC]: Wilco.  
BRIGADIER: Take over, Benton.  
BENTON: Right, sir.  
ISOBEL: Are we going to go in and help the Doctor?  
BRIGADIER: Ah yes.  
ZOE: He'll need it if he's got to fight his way through two hundred Cybermen.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, I only wish we had more time to release more men from the
Cyber-control. As it is we've only got a platoon.  
TURNER [OC]: Captain Turner to UNIT Control. Come in Control. Do you read me,
over?  
BENTON: Loud and clear. Hang on, sir!  
BRIGADIER: Yes, Jimmy. Over.  
TURNER [OC]: Hello sir. The Russians have fitted a warhead to the rocket now,
sir. A super-cooled hydrogen device. It's a solid fuel booster so it's nearly
ready for liftoff. Over.  
BRIGADIER: Good, Jimmy, sounds promising. We probably haven't got all that
much time, but there's no reason why we shouldn't chuck everything we've got
at them. Out.  
WING COMMANDER [OC]: Ready for take off, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Take off.

**[Henlow Downs]**

BENTON [OC]: All UNIT personnel to flight positions. Standard take off
procedure. Assault platoon, prepare for action. ETA, fifteen minutes
approximately. All mobile UNIT groups proceed to Red sector two area. I say
again, all mobile UNIT groups proceed to Red sector two area.  
PETERS: Do you think that Russian rocket stands any chance?  
BRANWELL: At that distance? Not enough time.  
PETERS: No, I suppose not.  
BRANWELL: That's why those Cybermen things are keeping their range. They know
they're safe.  
PETERS: But you never know, they could take time to get that bomb of theirs
ready, and that Russian rocket might make it.  
BRANWELL: Yeah, it just might.  
(The rocket and its deadly payload lift off, presumably from Krasnoyarsk or
somewhere similar.)

**[Aeroplane]**

BENTON: Sir, Captain Turner reports Russian missile on it's way.  
BRIGADIER: Wish them luck. Now, Captain Turner will be keeping us posted stage
by stage, so keep listening, Benton.  
BENTON: Sir.  
PILOT [OC]: UNIT sector five chopper to Command. Over.  
BENTON: Command here. Receiving you. Over.  
PILOT [OC]: Coming in to land at the compound, Red sector two. My passenger
wants a word. Over.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Er, Brigadier. We're just coming in to land at the compound.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, hang on till we get there. We'll give you support.  
DOCTOR [OC]: No, no, I'm sorry, Brigadier. We must go in right away, otherwise
we'll be too late.  
BRIGADIER: But that's madness. You don't stand a chance against the Cybermen
without us.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Don't worry. We have the Professor's machine. It's proved to be
very effective so far.  
BRIGADIER: Well, don't take any chances. We'll get there as soon as we can.
Where should we head for?  
DOCTOR: Vaughn says that the transmitter controls are in the old IE factory.
That's on the east side of the compound.  
BRIGADIER: Right.  
PILOT: Chopper Pilot to Command, sir. Coming down now. What shall I do, stick
around? Over.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, hover above them. It'll give us a bearing.  
PILOT: Wilco. Out.  
BRIGADIER: How long before we touch down, Benton?  
BENTON: About ten minutes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Right, get the men out as soon as we've taxied in.  
BENTON: Right, sir. Assault platoon prepare for action. Maintain constant
communication with control on Red alert frequency.  
ZOE: Can we come with you?  
BRIGADIER: Well I don't really think  
ISOBEL: It'll be the last chance I'll get to photograph the Cybermen. Please.  
BRIGADIER: As long as you keep out of the way. At least I'll be able to keep
an eye on you this time.

**[Factory grounds]**

(The Doctor and Vaughn are making their way to the building. They spot a
Cyberman patrolling and Vaughn readies Watkin's device, but the Doctor pulls
him back.)  
VAUGHN: What are you doing? We must destroy them!  
DOCTOR: We want to get to the radio transmitter control room. The Cybermen
don't know we're here yet. Let's keep that element of surprise. Come on, we'll
try down here.  
(This time there is no avoiding another Cyberman, but Vaughn gets it before it
can fire its weapon.)  
DOCTOR: Now they know we're here.  
VAUGHN: Right. Up there. We'll go over the roofs.  
(They run up the fire escape and look down on an area where several Cybermen
are standing.)  
VAUGHN: That's it. That's where we've got to get to. Down there.

**[Factory entrance]**

(UNIT and 2nd Battalion Coldsteam Guards arrive.)  
BRIGADIER: There's the chopper. The Doctor's over that way. Follow me!  
SOLDIER: Yes, sir.

**[Factory rooftop]**

DOCTOR: Look out!  
(Another Cyberman gets treated to a blast of strong emotions. It tumbles over
the edge of the roof and lands with a clang.)  
DOCTOR: Look out! Come on!  
(A group of four Cybermen are coming their way.)  
DOCTOR: Is this the only way down?  
VAUGHN: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Come on, then.  
(The Doctor and Vaughn go down another ladder.)

**[Factory compound]**

BRIGADIER: Cybermen! Take cover!  
(The army engage the enemy.)  
BRIGADIER: Grenades!  
(The explosions take out some Cybermen, but the rest keep coming, killing the
soldiers.)  
BRIGADIER: Bazooka!  
(That is effective too. The Doctor and Vaughn can hear the gunfire.)  
BRIGADIER: If they come around, move.  
(More grenades and bazooka fire.)  
BRIGADIER: Stop! Forward!  
(Zoe and Isobel accompany the Brigadier as he views the remains of the enemy.)  
BRIGADIER: And that was just a dozen of them. I'd hate to have to meet a
hundred of them. Forward!  
SOLDIER: Forward!  
(Isobel takes some souvenir pictures. The Doctor and Vaughn come to a building
with a small door.)  
VAUGHN: That's where the main control switch is for the radio beam.  
DOCTOR: There don't seem to be any Cybermen about at all. That's odd.  
VAUGHN: Well let's not waste time, then.  
(Vaughn goes up to the small door, as three of Cybermen come out of a nearby
building.)  
DOCTOR: Look behind you!  
(Vaughn uses the device and takes out two of them, but the third one fires his
weapon and kills him. The Doctor runs, dodging explosions from the cyber-
weapon. The army arrive.)  
BRIGADIER: Doctor, get down!  
(The Doctor obeys instantly.)  
BRIGADIER: Right, bazooka!  
(The Cyberman is killed.)  
BRIGADIER: You all right, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: What? Yes, yes, it's there, in that building. The radio transmitter
control, you've got to destroy it!  
BRIGADIER: Leave it to us. Forward!  
ISOBEL: Just a second.  
(Isobel takes photographs of the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, but I  
(As the soldiers run past, the Doctor tries to tidy himself up for the
camera.)  
ISOBEL: That's it. That's better. Sit still.

**[Aeroplane]**

BRIGADIER: And for the moment, the crisis is over. The radio transmitter's
been destroyed, so the Cybermen can no longer deliver their bomb. But their
spaceship is still sending out its hypnotic signals. The world is still
paralysed.

**[Henlow Downs]**

BRIGADIER [OC]: To stop these signals, we have to destroy the Cyberman
spaceship.  
PETERS: Sir!  
BRIGADIER [OC]: The Russians have already launched a missile which should
arrive on target in approximately six hours from now.  
BRANWELL: What is it, Sergeant?  
PETERS: Something on the screen, moving in fast.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: If this is successful,  
PETERS: Look at the size of it!  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Then the world will be released from the Cyber-control, and we
can mobilise our forces to fight the Cybermen  
BRANWELL: That can only be one thing. The spaceship.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Remaining on earth. In this case, I'd like all units  
BRANWELL: Hello, UNIT Control. Hello, UNIT Control. Henlow Downs calling UNIT
control. Over.  
BRIGADIER [OC]: Yes, Major.  
BRANWELL: Sorry to interrupt you sir, but we've picked up a large UFO
approaching Earth.

**[Aeroplane]**

BRANWELL [OC]: It's standing off at about fifty thousand miles. Outside our
range, I'm afraid. Over.  
ZOE: They've moved in. Why?  
BRIGADIER: Thank you, Major. Out. Get Captain Turner.  
BENTON: Right, sir. UNIT Control calling Captain Turner. UNIT Control calling
Captain Turner. Do you read me?  
BRIGADIER: Why do you think they've moved their spaceship in so close, Doctor?  
BENTON: UNIT Control calling Captain Turner. UNIT Control calling Captain
Turner. Do you read me?  
DOCTOR: I'm not sure. Possibly to try to avoid the Russian missile or  
BRIGADIER: Or to deliver their bomb by other means.  
BENTON: UNIT Control calling Captain Turner. UNIT control Calling Captain
Turner. Do you read me?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid so. You see, from where they were, let's say two
hundred and thirty thousand miles out in space, their conventional missiles
couldn't deliver the bomb, so they had to come in close.  
ZOE: But in moving in fifty thousand miles, they've come into range of the
Russian missiles. Well, it can't be more than a few miles from them.  
DOCTOR: But it's going in the opposite direction!  
TURNER [OC]: Captain Turner here. Over.  
BENTON: Here we are, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, Jimmy.  
TURNER [OC]: Sir. Sorry about the delay but we've had a bit of a flap on here.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, we know. Can the Russians turn their missile?  
TURNER [OC]: Yes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: How long before it strikes?  
TURNER [OC]: They estimate twelve point five minutes, sir.  
BRIGADIER: Thank you, Jimmy. Out. That's more than time enough for them to
deliver their bomb and move out to safety, isn't it?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Brigadier, I'm afraid it is.  
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, this is going to be a long twelve minutes.  
(The clock moves from two twenty to two twenty six. The only sound is Benton
knocking over his tea mug.)  
BENTON: Sorry, sir.

**[Henlow Downs]**

PETERS: There it is. The Russian missile.  
BRANWELL: Thank heavens for that. I'll tell UNIT control.  
PETERS: Ah! Must be the Cybermen's bomb.  
BRANWELL: Red alert procedure! Raise all missiles!

**[Aeroplane]**

BRANWELL [OC]: It'll be in range in about thirty seconds, sir. It's travelling
fast but we stand a good chance of picking it off. Over.  
BRIGADIER: How about the Cyber-spaceship, is that still there?  
BRANWELL [OC]: Still there, sir. If they don't shift soon that Russian missile
will hit it right on the button.  
BRIGADIER: Let's hope so.

**[Henlow Downs]**

PETERS: Coming into range sir.  
BRANWELL: Must go, sir. Over and out.  
PETERS: Fifteen seconds.  
BRANWELL: Right. Let's get it first time, lads!  
PETERS: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six  
(Branwell arms the system.)  
PETERS: Five, four, three, two, one, zero!  
(A missile zooms away.)  
PETERS: She's going wide!  
BRANWELL: Prepare two!  
PETERS: Two away, and it looks good.  
BRANWELL: Splendid! Stand by three, just in case.  
PETERS: Standing by.  
PETERS: Ten seconds and it's on the button! It's on the button! We've done it!  
BRANWELL: Hello, UNIT Control. Hello, UNIT Control. Henlow Downs calling UNIT
Control. Over.  
PETERS: Sir, the Russian missile, it's almost on top of the spaceship! I think
they've got her!  
(KaBOOM!)

**[Lounge]**

(Back at the house Professor Walters is renting from Professor Travers -
another photographic session is underway.)  
ISOBEL: Tired?  
ZOE: No, exhausted!  
ISOBEL: Okay, you can take a breather.  
ZOE: Thanks.  
ISOBEL: Thank goodness I don't have to do any more modelling for a living.  
ZOE: What is this new job of yours, then?  
ISOBEL: Well, because of my photographs of the Cybermen in action, I've got an
exclusive contract with a publishing group. So I'll be travelling all over the
world, snapping away with my little black box. What will you do now?  
ZOE: Oh, when the Doctor's finished making his circuits, we'll be off again, I
suppose.  
ISOBEL: Where to?  
ZOE: Well, we're never really sure.  
(Turner enters.)  
TURNER: Hello.  
ISOBEL: Ah! Here comes my dolly soldier.  
TURNER: Cheeky. Zoe, the Doctor says he's almost ready to leave. I've got the
Jeep outside.  
ZOE: Oh fine. But what about Jamie?  
TURNER: Oh, he's all right. He's just having a check-up at the hospital. We'll
pick him up on the way.  
ISOBEL: Well, can I come with you?  
TURNER: As long as you promise not to call me your dolly soldier in front of
the Brigadier, yes. Come on.  
ZOE: Right, come on!

**[Field]**

(Turner drives Isobel, the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe back to where they parked the
invisible Tardis.)  
ISOBEL: Here?  
DOCTOR: Yes. This is fine, thank you.  
TURNER: A field? There's nothing here.  
ZOE: Are you sure this is the place, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Well I'm very much obliged to you, Captain.  
TURNER: Oh, goodbye.  
DOCTOR: Goodbye to you. Goodbye, Isobel. Goodbye, everyone. Come along, Jamie.  
(They all exchange farewells and the Doctor, Zoe and Jamie go through the gate
into the field proper.)  
ISOBEL: Why are they going into that field?  
TURNER: I've no idea.  
DOCTOR: Now, then, where exactly did we leave it? You two try over there.  
(The travellers spread their arms wide in a game of reverse blind-man's bluff
to find the Tardis.)  
ISOBEL: What's he doing?  
TURNER: Search me.  
(The Doctor scratches his head and discovers that his elbow has disappeared.
The invisibility field obviously extends a couple of inches beyond the Tardis
exterior. He unlocks it and goes inside. The engine starts up and the Tardis
appears. The Doctor steps outside.)  
DOCTOR: There we are, all done and ready to go. Bye bye. Bye!  
ZOE: Bye.  
JAMIE: Bye.  
ISOBEL: A police box? I don't believe it.  
(Jamie, Zoe and the Doctor enter the Tardis, and it dematerialises.)
