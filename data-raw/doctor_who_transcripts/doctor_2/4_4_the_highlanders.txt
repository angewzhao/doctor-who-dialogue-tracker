__**Episode One**__

**[Culloden moor]**

(1746. Scottish Highland clans, loyal to Bonnie Prince Charles Edward, battle
with the English and German regiments loyal to the English monarch, King
George. Finally overpowered by superior forces, the Highlanders break ranks
and leave the battlefield. The leader of Clan McLaren, Colin, is badly
injured. His son Alexander, daughter Kirsty and a young piper called Jamie
McCrimmon, accompany him. Confronted on the path by two Redcoats, Alexander
engages the soldiers in a sword fight. He kills one Redcoat and the other
flees, allowing the small group to move on seeking refuge. The Tardis
materialises in small hollow, concealed from view by bushes and brambles. Ben
comes out, followed by Polly and the Doctor.)  
POLLY: It's so cool.  
BEN: Hey, Polly.  
POLLY: What?  
BEN: Where does this remind you of?  
POLLY: Oh, it's cold and damp.  
BEN: No, where does it remind you of?  
POLLY: Ouch! Prickles! What?  
BEN: Where else could it be? We're home, Duchess!  
POLLY: Oh, you never give up hope, do you? We'll ask the Doctor. Hey, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Listen.  
(There's an explosion in the distance.)  
BEN: It sounds like the cup final.  
(Something whistles towards them, fast.)  
POLLY: Look out!  
(Ben and Polly throw themselves to the ground as the something goes Boom
nearby. The Doctor hides in the brambles, hands over his head.)  
DOCTOR: What are you doing down there?  
BEN: What was it? It looks like an old-time cannon ball. Ow! It's hot.  
DOCTOR: Allow me. Yes, a ten pounder. That does it.  
POLLY: But Doctor, we can't leave. This looks like England.  
BEN: Yeah, I'm going to look over that hill.  
POLLY: Doctor, you don't want us to think you're afraid, do you?  
DOCTOR: Why not?  
POLLY: Look, we can't let Ben go up there on his own. We don't know what he's
going to find. Come on.

**[Cottage]**

(In a ruined cottage, Kirsty is tending her father's wounds.)  
COLIN: Ahh, Kirsty. Ahh.  
KIRSTY: He badly needs a doctor.  
(Everyone say Hi to Hannah Gordon.)  
ALEXANDER: Aye, and food.  
COLIN: Water. Water.  
KIRSTY: Whist, father.  
ALEXANDER: Water. Water.  
JAMIE: There's a wee drop left yet.  
(Everyone say Hi! to handsome young Fraser Hines as the McLaren drinks from
the canteen and Jamie looks at the remaining piece of his bagpipes - the
chanter.)  
COLIN: The battle. The battle!  
ALEXANDER: It's done. The clans are broken, shot to pieces by the English
guns. Never had the chance to get to within claymore's length of them.  
COLIN: Ah, the slaughter.  
(Jamie starts to play.)  
ALEXANDER: Whist! Do you want to bring the redcoats upon us?  
JAMIE: They'll be here soon enough, have no fear.  
COLIN: The Prince?  
JAMIE: Dinna fash yourself. He was the first to leave the field.  
ALEXANDER: What's that you say about the Prince?  
COLIN: Ah stay, the pair of you. Why didn't you leave me to die on the field?  
ALEXANDER: You're the Laird himself.  
COLIN: The Laird of what? All the men of our clan are lying in the mud of the
Culloden Moor. Oh, I should be with them. Oh, Kirsty, my Kirsty.  
ALEXANDER: We may not be long joining them. The English troops are butchering
all their wounded and hanging all their prisoners.  
JAMIE: They canna hang us all, can they?  
ALEXANDER: They'll never hang me, piper. You may be sure of that.  
(Alexander sees movement outside)  
ALEXANDER: Whist!  
KIRSTY: The English?  
ALEXANDER: There is but three of them.  
JAMIE: They're not soldiers.  
COLIN: Our people?  
ALEXANDER: Well, I'll find out. Jamie, at the rear. You gang that way. Wait my
signal.

**[Near the cottage]**

(Jamie and Alexander set off in opposite directions to circle round. Ben spots
an abandoned field gun.)  
BEN: Hey, look! This must be where that cannon ball came from.  
DOCTOR: It's unlikely.  
BEN: What do you mean it's unlikely?  
DOCTOR: It's been spiked.  
BEN: Been what?  
DOCTOR: It's been spiked.  
(A long spike has been hammered down the barrel.)  
BEN: Well, how did you know?  
(The Doctor has spotted a bonnet with eagle feather and Jacobite cockade.)  
DOCTOR: I would like a hat like this. How do I look?  
POLLY: It's got words on it. With Charles our brave and merciful Prince Royal,
we'll greatly fall or nobly save our country.  
DOCTOR: Bah. Romantic piffle.  
(The Doctor throws the bonnet to the ground.)  
ALEXANDER: You'll pick it up.  
(His claymore is at the Doctor's throat.)  
JAMIE: Careful, like.  
(Jamie has his dirk at Ben's chest. The Doctor picks up the bonnet.)  
ALEXANDER: This way with you. Quick!  
(The battle draws closer.)

**[Cottage]**

COLIN: We're going to awa' to the caves.  
KIRSTY: Father, you're in no fit state to travel.  
ALEXANDER: Kirsty! Get away with you.  
COLIN: Who are they?  
ALEXANDER: I know not. They're no Scot. They threw down the Prince's cockade.  
POLLY: Cockade?  
BEN: What Prince?  
DOCTOR: Prince Charles Edward. Bonnie Prince Charlie.  
ALEXANDER: You have the tongue. Aye, I thought so. English, the three of them.
Camp followers to the Duke of Cumberland, come to steal from the dead.  
COLIN: Abide a moment! Do you wish to pray before you die?  
DOCTOR: Die?  
POLLY: Die for what?  
BEN: Well, you can't kill us in cold blood.  
JAMIE: Well, our bloods warm enough! Your English troopers gave no quarter to
men, women and bairns.  
POLLY: Doctor, tell them who we are.  
KIRSTY: Doctor?  
ALEXANDER: Get away with you, woman.  
KIRSTY: We have need of a doctor.  
ALEXANDER: The Laird.  
COLIN: Get me a doctor. Get me a doctor.  
KIRSTY: Look, kill them after. Let them help the Laird first.  
ALEXANDER: We're not going to trust the Laird with these sassenachs, woman.  
(Ben dives forward and snatches a pistol from Colin's side.)  
KIRSTY: But if they can help him at all  
ALEXANDER: Kirsty, get away, will you.  
DOCTOR: Just think of the women.  
BEN: Right, back both of you! Or your Laird won't need a doctor.  
DOCTOR: Well done, Ben. And now, gentlemen.  
ALEXANDER: I'm warning you!  
DOCTOR: Your swords, I think. Ben, cock the pistol.  
KIRSTY: But why? Give them up!  
DOCTOR: Polly, take the swords. That's the style. Now, back against the wall,
both of you. Go on! That's better. Now, I'm going to have a look at the wound.
Come along, come along, let me see. Yes. We're going to need some clean water
to bathe the wound. Ah.  
(The Doctor picks up a bucket and gives it to Kirsty.)  
KIRSTY: I'll not leave him.  
DOCTOR: We're not going to harm him. Polly?  
POLLY: Yes.  
DOCTOR: You go with her.  
POLLY: All right.  
DOCTOR: Off you go then.  
POLLY: Will you show me where the stream is?  
ALEXANDER: Here, Kirsty. Take the Laird's spyglass with you and watch out for
these Sassenach dragoons.  
(Polly and Kirsty leave.)  
DOCTOR: You can put that away now, Ben.  
BEN: Put it away? But  
DOCTOR: Will you both give us your word that you'll not molest us? We're only
trying to save your Laird from bleeding to death.  
ALEXANDER: Aye.  
JAMIE: You have our word.  
DOCTOR: Put it away, Ben.  
BEN: What, are you going to trust these blokes?  
DOCTOR: A Highlanders word is his bond. At least don't point it at me!  
(Ben tosses the pistol onto the table. Bang!)  
BEN: It just went off.  
ALEXANDER: You fool!  
JAMIE: You'll have every English soldier within miles!  
BEN: Well, what's wrong with that?  
DOCTOR: What's? You should have paid more attention to your history books,
Ben.  
BEN: Ay?  
JAMIE: Redcoats! There's about six of them.  
ALEXANDER: They'll slaughter us.

**[Culloden moor]**

(An elegant officer, Algernon Ffinch, gazes down at the cottage.)  
SERGEANT: Sir! A rebel's been sighted, sir, at the door the cottage where the
shooting seemed to come from.  
FFINCH: Good. Only one?  
SERGEANT: Only one seen, sire. There could be more.  
FFINCH: There better be. We haven't seen many, have we?  
SERGEANT: No, well, the troopers were ahead of us, sir.  
FFINCH: And done a good job. Now, I wish they'd left us some pickings.  
SERGEANT: Ah, perhaps when they got away they took their possessions with
them.  
FFINCH: Let's hope so. Take a man around the rear, Sergeant. We'll out-flank
them.  
SERGEANT: Sir!  
FFINCH: Tell them to shoot first and take no risks. Remember these rebels will
be desperate by now.  
SERGEANT: Yes, sir!  
FFINCH: Advance in battle order.  
(His soldiers fix bayonets and advance.)

**[Cottage]**

JAMIE: We'll be caught like rats in a trap. Can we not run for it?  
ALEXANDER: And leave the Laird to their mercy? There is but one chance. It is
but a very slim one. I will try and draw them away from this cottage.  
DOCTOR: Wait! Wait!  
(Alexander runs out to face the Redcoats.)

**[Culloden moor]**

ALEXANDER: Creag an tuire!  
(He is shot repeatedly.)

**[Cottage]**

SERGEANT: Surrender in the King's name!  
BEN: Blimey, it's good to hear a London voice again.  
SERGEANT: Silence, you rebel dog.  
BEN: Rebel? What are you talking about? I'm no rebel! Me and the Doctor here,
have just arrived.  
SERGEANT: Deserter, then. You'll hang just the same.  
DOCTOR: (German accent) I'm glad you've come, Sergeant. I was waiting for an
escort.  
SERGEANT: Who the devil do  
DOCTOR: Civil tongue, Sergeant! You are in charge of these men?  
FFINCH: No, I am.  
DOCTOR: A gentleman at last. Doctor von Wer, at your service.  
SERGEANT: Doctor who?  
DOCTOR: (sotto) That's what I said.  
FFINCH: One of those confounded froggies that came over with the Pretender.  
BEN: We ain't French. Are we?  
DOCTOR: German, from Hanover. Where your good King George comes from. And I
speak English a good deal better than he does.  
SERGEANT: Hear that, sir. Treason! Shall we hang them now?  
FFINCH: Wait a moment. Who is that?  
JAMIE: Colin McLaren, the Laird, and I'm his piper.  
SERGEANT: Ah, they're a poor lot, sir. We'll get no pickings here. Let's hang
them and have done.  
BEN: Well, a right shower you are! What have we done? Nothing! And what have
you got against these two? They lost a battle, right? Well, doesn't that make
them prisoners of war?  
FFINCH: Rebels are not treated as prisoners of war. Right, Sergeant, prepare
to hang them.  
SERGEANT: Sir. Take him out.  
DOCTOR: Didn't I tell you I was  
SERGEANT: And you.  
BEN: But we haven't done anything!  
SERGEANT: And you.  
JAMIE: But he can't walk!  
SERGEANT: Drag him!

**[Duke of Cumberland's line]**

(On a supply wagon, an English solicitor called Grey has been watching the
battle through a telescope. His secretary, Perkins, is setting up luncheon.)  
GREY: Perkins. Perkins!  
PERKINS: Yes, sir.  
GREY: Not a very inspiring battle, would you say, Perkins?  
PERKINS: Don't really know, sir. I've never seen one before.  
GREY: This one was over in a brief hour. Never have I seen such brave fellows
so poorly led. And now, Cumberland's troops are butchering the wounded. It's
such a waste of manpower. A little wine, Perkins?  
PERKINS: Oh, yes, sir. Quite ready for it, I am, sir. This sharp northern air,
sir, gives one quite an appetite.  
(Two soldiers appear with a Scottish prisoner. The wounded Highlander looks
longingly at the food as he is dragged past.)  
GREY: Ah, all these fine sturdy Highlanders. Used to hard work and little
food. Think what a price they'd fetch in Jamaica or Barbados, Perkins.  
PERKINS: A pretty penny, no doubt, sir. No doubt at all.  
GREY: Indeed, and I'll have them, Perkins. I did not give up a thriving legal
practise, just for the honour of serving King George as his Commissioner of
Prisons.  
PERKINS: I thought there was more behind it, sir.  
GREY: With Mister Trask and his ship at our service, we may expect to clear
some measure of profit out of this rebellion, ay Perkins?  
PERKINS: Yes, sir.  
GREY: Depending, of course, on how many of the wretched rebels we can deliver
from his Majesty's over zealous soldiers.  
(Grey tastes his wine and spits it out in disgust, throwing the rest into
Perkins' face.)  
GREY: The wine was corked. If you wish to remain in my service, you'll have to
be more careful, won't you, Perkins?  
PERKINS: Yes, sir. My apologies, sir. It won't happen again, sir.  
GREY: I think we best be about our business, otherwise there'll be nothing but
corpses left on the battlefield. And corpses are of little use to us, ay
Perkins?  
PERKINS: Yes, sir. Wagon, sir?  
GREY: No, I think not. I've had enough for one day. Come, Perkins, we'll walk.  
PERKINS: Yes, sir.  
(Grey strides off, leaving Perkins to cope with the hamper.)  
GREY: Perkins.  
PERKINS: Yes, sir?  
(Perkins takes a mouthful of wine.)  
GREY: Perkins!

**[Culloden moor]**

(Polly and Kirsty are returning to the cottage with the water. At the top of
the hill they spot the soldiers outside the cottage.)  
KIRSTY: Down!  
POLLY: Oh, you've spilt the water. Who are those men?  
KIRSTY: Don't pretend you can't recognise English Redcoats when you see them,
even at this distance.  
POLLY: English? Well, that's all right, then. We're safe.  
KIRSTY: Do you want to get us both killed? Tortured? Look, they're going to
hang our men.  
(Polly takes the telescope to see nooses being hung over the branch of an oak
tree.)  
POLLY: You're right. It's horrible. They've got to be stopped.  
KIRSTY: How?  
POLLY: Well, there must be something we can do?  
KIRSTY: We can but mourn.  
POLLY: Crying's no good. Have you still got breath to run. Come on. We're
going to create a diversion.  
(Polly throws a stone in the direction of the cottage.)

**[Outside the cottage]**

FFINCH: What was that?  
(A second stone hits a soldier.)  
SERGEANT: Look, sir, over there, on that hill.  
FFINCH: Looks like a wench. Stab me, there's another one.  
SERGEANT: Yeah, puts me in mind of what Sergeant King of the Dragoons said,
sir.  
FFINCH: What?  
SERGEANT: Well, the Dragoons have got orders to stop every woman. Not that
they need them, mind.  
FFINCH: Get to the point, Sergeant.  
SERGEANT: Well, they've heard that the Prince is trying to escape disguised as
a woman. Shall I go after them, sir?  
FFINCH: No, I'll go. You two men, come with me.  
SERGEANT: Yeah, but I

**[Culloden moor]**

POLLY: This is our chance. The officer's coming after us. They can't hang them
with the officer away. Let's go.  
KIRSTY: It'll do no good.  
POLLY: Besides which, you must know this place better than they do.  
KIRSTY: There's a high track.  
POLLY: And we're younger than they are. They'll never catch us. Come on.  
KIRSTY: But, look  
POLLY: Leave that.  
(Kirsty leaves the bucket. After a short while Polly has to abandon her shoes
and go barefoot to keep up with Kirsty. The soldiers start to fall behind.)

**[Outside the Cottage]**

(The Doctor, Ben, Jamie and Colin all have nooses around their necks.)  
DOCTOR: What a great devotion to duty your Lieutenant shows, Sergeant.  
SERGEANT: Devotion to duty. Devotion to thirty thousand pound reward, that's
all.  
DOCTOR: You think he will catch them?  
SERGEANT: That young whelp? Couldn't catch his own grandmother.  
DOCTOR: Disrespect to your superior officer, Sergeant? I could report you.  
SERGEANT: You could, but you won't.  
DOCTOR: Ah, but at a price, Sergeant.  
SERGEANT: You won't, cause you won't be here when he gets back. All right you
scum, proceed with the hanging.  
BEN: Well, you can't hang us with the officer away.  
SERGEANT: Why do you think he went away? Got a delicate stomach, he has.
Always leaves the dirty stuff to me. Right! Get them up!  
(The prisoners are forced to stand on a bench.)  
SERGEANT: Take the strain! Stand by!  
(A drum roll starts.)  
GREY: Halt!  
SERGEANT: What do you want?  
GREY: One moment!  
SERGEANT: Who the devil are you?  
GREY: Perkins.  
PERKINS: Solicitor Grey, Lincolns Inn Fields. His Majesty's Commissioner for
the disposal of rebel prisoners.  
GREY: There's a fine sturdy young man. Take the nooses off them. Set that
young man down.  
PERKINS: Set him down.  
SERGEANT: I don't care who you are. You've got no charge over my men.  
GREY: Can you not read, Sergeant? I have charge over all rebel prisoners.  
PERKINS: Of course he has. Appointed by the Chief Justice of England. All
prisoners.  
SERGEANT: Not these.  
GREY: Perkins.  
(Perkins searches in his pocket.)  
GREY: The other pocket, I think.  
(Perkins produces some silver coins.)  
GREY: I admit your prior claim, Sergeant, but I think you are a reasonable
man.  
(The payment is refused.)  
GREY: Continue, Perkins. Continue, I said. Of course, I regret any
inconvenience encountered by yourself and these fine fellows of yours.  
SERGEANT: All right, you heard what the Commissioner said. Nooses off. Get him
down.  
BEN: Oh, thanks, sir.  
GREY: A trifle, I assure you. Strong ruffians like you and this other young
rebel here, are needed in his Majesty's service.  
DOCTOR: Ah, yes.  
(Grey gestures to the Doctor and Colin.)  
GREY: You can despatch this one, Sergeant, and this strange looking scoundrel.  
DOCTOR: Article Seventeen, Aliens Act, 1730.  
GREY: What?  
DOCTOR: You are gentlemen of the law?  
PERKINS: How dare you speak to Mister Grey like that.  
GREY: I am a lawyer, yes.  
DOCTOR: Then you are doubtless familiar with Article Seventeen. You cannot
hang a citizen of a foreign power, without first informing his ambassador.  
PERKINS: Article Seventeen, Aliens Act?  
GREY: Who is this extraordinary rogue?  
SERGEANT: He says he's a frog doctor, sir.  
DOCTOR: German. And I know more about the English law than you do, it seems.  
SERGEANT: I'm the only law what matters to you right now, matey. And if this
gentleman don't want you, you hang.  
GREY: No, wait. You show a touching faith in his Majesty's justice, sir. A
doctor, eh? We need doctors where you're going. Send him along with the other
prisoners to Inverness.  
JAMIE: The Laird goes too or you can hang me with him. I'll not go with ye.  
COLIN: No, go, Jamie, go.  
SERGEANT: We'll see about that.  
GREY: Sergeant! What do you think, Doctor? Can this man be healed of his
wound?  
DOCTOR: With proper care, yes.  
GREY: Whether he'll get that where he is going is very doubtful. But I'll
leave him in your care. Take him away, Sergeant.  
SERGEANT: Sir! 'Shun! You men escort these gentlemen and these prisoners to
Inverness. I'll wait here for the Lieutenant. Come on, out. Get him down.  
DOCTOR: What will happen to us?  
GREY: First you go to Inverness, and then perhaps a sea voyage?  
SERGEANT: Do you good, rogue. Come on.  
GREY: Just in time, Perkins. Just in time.

**[Cave]**

KIRSTY: This is the cave. They'll not find us here.  
(A narrow fissure widens out into a large cave.)  
POLLY: You don't live here, do you?  
KIRSTY: Oh, no. The family use it as a hide out after a cattle raid.  
POLLY: A cattle raid? You mean you rob people?  
KIRSTY: No! We only take from those who steal from us.  
POLLY: Oh, it's dark.  
KIRSTY: Ah, there we are.  
POLLY: That's a funny kind of match.  
KIRSTY: What?  
POLLY: Match. Oh, it doesn't matter.  
KIRSTY: Now, we keep a supply of food here. Oh no, there's only one wheat
biscuit.  
POLLY: When was it left here?  
KIRSTY: Well, about three months ago.  
POLLY: Oh, it's a dog biscuit.  
KIRSTY: Biscuits are not baked for dogs. But please do begin.  
POLLY: Oh, no, no, you start. I don't want to lose all my fillings. Teeth.
Doesn't matter. You start. I'm not hungry, really. Got to make a plan. We saw
them being marched away. Now where would they be taking them?  
KIRSTY: Inverness gaol.  
POLLY: Oh, look, don't start crying again. If they've taken them to gaol, then
we've got to get them out. Have you got any money?  
KIRSTY: But what would we need money for?  
POLLY: Well, for food, of course. That biscuit isn't going to last very long.
And for bribing guards with. What have we got we can sell?  
(Polly looks at her bracelet.)  
POLLY: This won't fetch much, but at least its a start.  
KIRSTY: Why should you help us? You're English.  
POLLY: They've got my friends too, remember? Yes, and I must get some proper
clothes.  
KIRSTY: Aye, why do you wear the short skirts of a bairn? You're a grown
woman.  
POLLY: Well, it would take too long to explain.  
(Polly notices a large ring on Kirsty's finger.)  
POLLY: Hey, that ring. It's gold. Look, you've got to trust me.  
KIRSTY: It doesn't belong to me. It's my father's.  
POLLY: Well, let me just look at it. Come on, now. I just want to look at it,
that's all. It's beautiful. We should get a lot for that.  
KIRSTY: We're not going to sell it!  
POLLY: Not even to save your father's life?  
KIRSTY: He wouldn't thank me.  
POLLY: Oh, you're hopeless. Why not, for goodness sake?  
KIRSTY: He entrusted it to me before the battle. He would kill me if I ever
parted with it.  
POLLY: I don't understand you people. Come on, give it to me.  
KIRSTY: No.  
POLLY: Look, give it to me! It's the. Please yourself! You're just a stupid
peasant. I'm off to help my friends. You can stay here and guard your precious
ring.  
KIRSTY: Look, mind your step. It'll be dark soon.  
POLLY [OC]: Watch out for yourself.  
KIRSTY: You'll get lost.

**[Culloden moor]**

(Polly walks along a rough track. An owl hoots. Suddenly the ground gives way
under her feet and she falls. Polly screams. Winded but unhurt, Polly realises
she has fallen into an animal trap. She tries to scramble out, as a hand
clutching a dagger appears over her head. She screams again.)

__**Episode Two**__

**[Animal trap]**

POLLY: Don't.  
KIRSTY: Oh, it's yourself.  
POLLY: You! Of course it's myself. Who did you think it was?  
KIRSTY: I thought a Redcoat had fallen into the animal trap.  
POLLY: Well, by the look on your face I'm glad it wasn't. Come on, help me out
of here.  
KIRSTY: Well, look, give me your hand then.  
POLLY: Wait a minute, I can't  
KIRSTY: Well, come on.  
POLLY: Pull!  
KIRSTY: I'm pulling!  
(Kirsty falls into the pit as well.)  
POLLY: Are you hurt?  
KIRSTY: Oh, no. Just a wee bruise or two and a lot of dirt. Now we're both
trapped.  
POLLY: No we're not! Even your dour Scots lassies must have played piggy-back.  
KIRSTY: What? I don't understand.  
POLLY: Well, you bend down and I climb on top of you and scramble up. Look,
I'll show you.  
KIRSTY: What?  
POLLY: Bend down here a minute. All right.  
KIRSTY: Oh!  
POLLY: You okay?  
KIRSTY: Quick, will ye! You're no light weight. Oh, go on. Hurry! Come on.  
POLLY: Shh! There's a light. Soldiers.  
KIRSTY: Redcoats. Oh, we're cornered.  
POLLY: No, we're not. They'll soon pass.  
(They both crouch down as Ffinch and his men approach.)

**[Culloden moor]**

FFINCH: (to the other soldiers) Halt! You dolt. Couldn't catch a couple of
wenches, could you? Call yourselves soldiers? The terror of the Highlands? You
wouldn't frighten an one-armed dairy maid. Well, I've done enough walking for
one day. Go and fetch my horse. If you're not back within one hour, three
hundred lashes apiece. Imbeciles! Give the lantern to me. I don't want to be
left here in the dark. Right then, march!  
(The soldiers leave.)

**[Animal trap]**

KIRSTY: He's staying there.  
POLLY: Oh, not again. Didn't the women of your age do anything but cry?  
KIRSTY: What?  
POLLY: It doesn't matter. Listen, I've got an idea. Since our officer has so
obligingly parked himself outside our pit, we'll lure him in to join us.  
KIRSTY: Oh, glory.  
POLLY: We'll be able to deal with him. Now, this is what we are going to do.

**[Culloden moor]**

(Ffinch has started eating when an owl hoots.)  
FFINCH: What's that?  
(He raises the lantern. Another woo sound and he draws his sword, moving
towards the trap. More noises and then he falls in.)

**[Animal trap]**

KIRSTY: Move and I'll blow your brains out.  
POLLY: She will too, so you better keep still. I'm going to take the sash for
his feet and you take the belt for his wrists.  
FFINCH: Outrageous! Do you know that for assaulting a King's Officer you could  
POLLY: I know. But you're not in charge now. The next thing is his pockets.  
KIRSTY: Ach, no!  
POLLY: Look, he's probably got money and we need it.  
FFINCH: You can't mean to rob me.  
KIRSTY: Look, you and your kind have robbed our glens. Look, he's got food.
Chicken and bread.  
POLLY: Great! Now, my gallant officer.  
FFINCH: I've done you no harm.  
KIRSTY: 'Tis no thanks to you that my father and Jamie weren't hanged. They're
probably rotting in gaol in Inverness by now.

**[Gaol]**

(Sounds of coughing in the dungeon that serves as Inverness gaol.)  
BEN: Look after him, mate. He'll be all right. Okay, mate, okay. Take it easy,
take it easy. Sit down.  
(Their cell is circular, waterlogged and moss-lined.)  
BEN: A right rat hole this is, isn't it?  
JAMIE: Oh, King George has worse than this, never fear.  
BEN: Yeah, well, I'm glad Polly's out of it. Why did we ever get mixed up in
this, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I'm glad we did. I'm just beginning to enjoy myself. Down with King
George!  
(Cheers.)  
SENTRY: Silence, you Jacobite pigs. You don't want to feel this bayonet.  
JAMIE: Oh, enjoy yourselves. So you are for the Prince after all?  
DOCTOR: No, not really. I just like hearing the echo, that's all. Let's have a
look at his wound, shall we?  
JAMIE: Would you not be letting him now?  
DOCTOR: With care that'll heal.  
JAMIE: Ach, here's you saying you're a doctor, you've not even bled him yet.  
BEN: What's he on about?  
DOCTOR: Blood letting.  
BEN: Yeah, but that's stupid.  
JAMIE: It's the only way of curing the sick.  
BEN: Killing him, more like. He's lost enough blood already.  
DOCTOR: Oh, Isis and Osiris, is it meet? Aquarius, Aries, Taurus.  
JAMIE: Oh, aye.  
BEN: (Now what are you mumbling about?  
JAMIE: Whist, man.  
DOCTOR: Gemini and Taurus. When was the Laird born?  
JAMIE: In the fifth month.  
DOCTOR: That's what I thought. Now, blood letting must wait until Taurus is in
the ascendant. So it is willed.  
BEN: You don't believe all that codswallop, do you?  
DOCTOR: Of course I do. So does he. He's never heard of germs.  
JAMIE: What was that word?  
DOCTOR: It's a secret word.  
BEN: Yeah, germs, they're all around us.  
DOCTOR: Used by German doctors.  
JAMIE: Oh, Ger-man. Germs.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Have you got a handkerchief, Ben?  
BEN: Yeah, here you are.  
DOCTOR: Good.  
JAMIE: Ach, that wee lassies kerchief? Here, Doctor, use mine.  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Just a fresh dressing.  
(As the Doctor binds Colin's wound he notices an embroidered silk cloth under
his plaid.)  
DOCTOR: Hello, what's this?  
JAMIE: Prince Charlie's personal standard.  
BEN: What's he doing with it?  
JAMIE: Protecting it. Now put it back, will ye. If a sentry saw it  
DOCTOR: No, wait.  
The Doctor wraps it around his body under his coat.)  
JAMIE: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: What chance do you think he has of evading the gallows with this on
him?  
JAMIE: Well  
DOCTOR: Besides, it's really rather nice and warm. Let's have a tune to cheer
us all up.  
(The Doctor produces his recorder.)  
BEN: Yeah, I didn't think we'd heard the last of that.  
SENTRY: Silence!  
JAMIE: Whist, man!  
DOCTOR: Well, you're a loyal Jacobite, aren't you? This is your tune. Come on,
everybody, join in.  
SENTRY: Silence, I say! I warned you rebels once! Now we'll see what a touch
of the bayonet will do. Now then!  
BEN: The guard is coming down now.  
SENTRY: You!  
DOCTOR: (German) Thank heavens. Did you hear that tune?  
SENTRY: Heard a rebel dirge.  
DOCTOR: They were singing it to drive me out of my mind, as I'm a loyal
subject to King George the Second!  
SENTRY: Now what's that got to do with me?  
DOCTOR: They know of a plot to murder your general, the Duke of Cumberland.  
JAMIE: What?  
BEN: Oh, come off it, Doctor.  
JAMIE: I knew he wasne one of us.  
DOCTOR: Take me to Solicitor Grey. Perhaps we're in time to prevent it.  
SENTRY: Why didn't you speak about this before?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's only just discovered. That rogue is party to it!  
(The prisoners shout and the guards take the Doctor away.)  
BEN: Well done, mate.  
JAMIE: What do you mean? Why don't you go and join your friend?  
BEN: Oh, calm down. Can't you see it was all a fiddle?  
JAMIE: Fiddle?  
BEN: Well, a trick, a ruse to get out of here.  
JAMIE: I don't understand you.  
BEN: Oh, blimey, look. Outside he's got a chance to get away and rescue us.
What chance do you think he's got paddling round in here?  
JAMIE: Aye, nevertheless, I'm still worried.  
BEN: Now don't you worry about him, mate, worry about us. See that line? Well,
that's where the water level comes up to. And tonight is not my bath night.

**[Animal trap]**

POLLY: seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty. Twenty guineas. How far do you
think it will get us?  
KIRSTY: I've never seen so much money in all my days.  
FFINCH: You'll both hang for this, you know.  
POLLY: You're very fond of hanging, aren't you, Mister. Hey, what's your name?  
FFINCH: I refuse to tell you.  
POLLY: Oh, we're very brave all of a sudden. Watch him, Kirsty. He must have
some form of. Ah-ha, yes. Algernon Thomas Alfred Ffinch. Two 'f's! Lieutenant
in the Honourable Colonel Atwood's Rifles. So, I bet the Colonel would be
highly interested to hear how his Lieutenant F-finch was captured by two
girls.  
FFINCH: You would not tell.  
POLLY: Oh, wouldn't we? Give me the knife, Kirsty.  
FFINCH: What are you going to do?  
POLLY: Never fear, Algernon Thomas F-finch. We're just after a small souvenir,
that's all. There we are. This piece of hair and this disc will be proof
enough in case the Colonel doesn't believe us.  
KIRSTY: But, but why?  
POLLY: We need an ally in the enemy camp and I think we've found one. Right,
Algernon?  
FFINCH: It's sheer blackmail.  
POLLY: Right again. Come on, Kirsty, let's go before this officer's soldiers
get back. Bye bye, Algy dear. We'll be seeing you in Inverness. Come on,
Kirsty. Up you go. All right?  
KIRSTY: Oh no. I

**[Inverness - Sea Eagle inn]**

(The lawyers meet with a sea captain in private.)  
TRASK: Well, lawyer, my old cattle boat's ready for its livestock. Belay
there! What in thunder are you laughing at?  
GREY: It will be no laughing matter for any of us if we are caught, I can
assure you. That is why we must begin loading the prisoners tonight.  
TRASK: Tonight?  
GREY: Before the judges are ready to try the rebels, we'll have them all
safely on plantations.  
TRASK: Arr. A Highlander will do twice the work of one of your black slaves.  
PERKINS: At least twice.  
TRASK: Who asked for your opinion?  
GREY: Silence, Captain. I will not have my clerk bullied. I have enough
evidence on you to send you to the gallows ten times over, and don't you
forget it.  
(A knock on the door.)  
GREY: Come in! Well?  
SENTRY: One of the prisoners, sir. He insists on seeing you. Says he has some
important information about a plot against the Duke's life, sir.  
GREY: Why come to me?  
SENTRY: Says he won't speak to no one else but you, sir.  
GREY: Which prisoner is it?  
SENTRY: The German doctor, sir.  
GREY: Ah, interesting. Bring him in at once.  
SENTRY: Sir.  
GREY: Well man, what are you waiting? Perkins.  
(Perkins reluctantly hands a shilling to the sentry, who then leaves.)  
GREY: Now, gentlemen, I suggest you start loading the prisoners at once. Here
is your warrant. And to avoid comment, you'd better take them the back way.  
SENTRY: The prisoner, sir.  
GREY: Perkins. Trask.  
(Trask and Perkins leave past the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: Auf Wiedersehen.  
TRASK: Arr.  
(Grey takes a flintlock pistol from the case on his desk and puts it on the
table.)  
GREY: You may go.  
SENTRY: Sir.  
(The sentry leaves.)  
GREY: Now, Doctor, your story. I hope it is an entertaining one. It has cost
me a silver shilling. Very well then, what is the nature of this plot?  
DOCTOR: There is no plot.  
GREY: Have a care, Doctor. You waste my time at your peril.  
DOCTOR: Would the chance to lay your hands on 15,000 pounds be a waste of your
time?  
GREY: What would a vagabond like you know of such a sum, pray?  
DOCTOR: The personal standard of Prince Charles Edward.  
GREY: Indeed.  
DOCTOR: Whoever was entrusted with this standard stood closest to the councils
of the Prince, you would agree? He would also know where the Prince was most
likely to run to.  
GREY: Which prisoner carried this standard?  
DOCTOR: That must remain my secret for the time being.  
GREY: There are ways to force your tongue.  
DOCTOR: But why employ them, since we are both on the same side? The 30,000
pounds reward for the capture of the Prince is surely enough to satisfy both
of us.  
GREY: Ah, you have some fresh information as to his whereabouts?  
DOCTOR: I am on the track of some, but I need a free hand.  
(Throwing the flag over Grey's head, the Doctor snatches the pistol.)  
DOCTOR: Don't cry out. I'm not very expert with these things and it just might
go off in your face. Turn around and put your hands behind you.  
GREY: You'll pay for this.  
DOCTOR: Just keep very still.  
(The Doctor uses Grey's own belt to tie his hands.)  
DOCTOR: There, now turn around. Why, great heavens, man, your throat.  
GREY: What?  
DOCTOR: It's so swollen. Does it hurt you?  
GREY: No, of course not.  
DOCTOR: Say ahh.  
GREY: What?  
DOCTOR: Ahh.  
GREY: Ahh. Mphf!  
(The Doctor stuffs a handkerchief into Grey's mouth.)  
DOCTOR: I've never seen a silent lawyer before.  
(A knock at the door.)  
DOCTOR: Would you mind just waiting in here? Another patient, you understand.  
(The Doctor shoves Grey into a cupboard then sits at the solicitor's desk.)  
DOCTOR: Enter.  
PERKINS: Oh, er, pardon, I thought that  
DOCTOR: You thought what?  
PERKINS: The, the Solicitor?  
DOCTOR: Your master's a very sick man. He's gone to lie down. It lucky for him
I was called in time. Well, great heavens, man. Your eyes!  
PERKINS: What?  
DOCTOR: Your eyes. Come over here to the light.  
(Perkins sits in the chair and the Doctor leans over him, bringing out a
magnifying glass to examine his eyes.)  
Your eyes, man. You suffer from headaches?  
PERKINS: No, I don't.  
(The Doctor bangs Perkins' head on the desk.)  
DOCTOR: No headaches?  
PERKINS: Well, er. Ow!  
(Another thump.)  
DOCTOR: Oh dear. You call me a liar?  
PERKINS: Well, no, no, no, no. Me head does ache.  
DOCTOR: Of course it does, what did you expect? Your eyes.  
PERKINS: Me eyes? What did you find?  
DOCTOR: Print blindness. You read too much.  
PERKINS: Well, 'tis true, I'm a clerk. What must I do?  
DOCTOR: You must rest them for at least an hour.  
PERKINS: But, I  
DOCTOR: That is my prescription. Ignore it at your peril. Now, lie down on the
table. That's right. And put this over your eyes and rest them for at least an
hour.  
(A thumping sound comes from the cupboard.)  
PERKINS: What's that knocking?  
DOCTOR: Knocking? It's not knocking, it's in your mind. In your eyes. Now rest
your eyes and the knocking will grow fainter, and fainter, and fainter. One
hour, remember.  
PERKINS: One hour, Doctor. One hour.  
(The Doctor blows him a kiss and leaves.)

**[Animal trap]**

SERGEANT [OC]: Sir?  
FFINCH: Sergeant!  
SERGEANT [OC]: Where are you sir? I can't quite see you.  
FFINCH: I'm down here, man!  
SERGEANT: Oh, there you are, sir.  
FFINCH: What took you so long, you jackanapes?  
SERGEANT: Well, we made the best time we could in the dark, sir, but it's hard
to see our way, you see?  
FFINCH: Well, don't just stand there. Get me out of this infernal hole.  
SERGEANT: All right, you two, I'll handle this. You go and stand guard by the
Lieutenant's horse. Come on.  
FFINCH: Well, come on, man. Help me out!  
SERGEANT: Well, it's er, it's very deep, sir.  
FFINCH: Get me out at once or I'll order you five hundred lashes apiece!  
SERGEANT: Oh, don't misunderstand me, sir. I'm willing enough to try, but you
see, er, we're not used to pulling officers out of pits.  
FFINCH: Confound it, man, what are you jabbering about?  
SERGEANT: Well, I mean to say, sir, you see, er, officers don't usually fall
into pits.  
FFINCH: You'll regret this, Sergeant.  
SERGEANT: Ah, it isn't me, sir. You see, it's the men I'm thinking about. I
mean, they're not used to it, like. I mean, they're going to be very slow,
sir. And they're going to be very dry.  
FFINCH: I see! Well, here's some money to drink with and I hope it chokes you!  
(Then he remembers the girls have taken all his money.)  
FFINCH: You'll, er, get it when we return to Inverness. Well, for the last
time, man, get me out of here.

**[Inverness - Sea Eagle inn]**

TRASK: We've started shipping them across. What in thunder?  
PERKINS: I'm resting me eyes.  
TRASK: Damn your eyes. Where's your master?  
PERKINS: The Doctor says he must rest too.  
TRASK: Rest?  
(Trask opens the cupboard to reveal Grey.)  
TRASK: Now what have we here then? A pretty sight you look, lawyer. And what
might this be a cure for, Saint Vitus's Dance?  
GREY: Oh, release me you fool. You let him escape.  
PERKINS: Well, I didn't know. It's me head.  
GREY: One more such folly, t'will need no further cures.  
TRASK: The Prince's standard.  
GREY: Aye, he used that to trick me with, but he won't get far. Perkins,
summon the watch! And you, get those prisoners aboard before the soldiers get
here.  
TRASK: Arr.

**[Inn scullery]**

(Perkins runs past the scullery where a maid is washing dishes and humming to
herself.)  
MAN [OC]: Mollie, where are ye?  
MOLLIE: All richt, all richt.  
MAN [OC]: Mollie!  
MOLLIE: Whist your noise, I'm coming.  
(Throwing off her apron, Mollie leaves. The Doctor comes out of hiding. A
washing line stretches along one wall hung with gowns, petticoats and aprons.
There is a large rough table with platters of bread and meat and a flagon of
wine. The Doctor starts towards the food, then changes his mind. He hears
footsteps outside.)  
MAN [OC]: There must be some grub around here somewhere.  
(The Doctor hides behind the clothesline as two Redcoats enter and sit at the
table.)

**[Gaol]**

TRASK: That's two of them, and room for one more. Here!  
SENTRY: All right you, come on. He's done for.  
TRASK: The next one, you swab.  
SENTRY: You. You'll do. Out with the others. Come on, all three of you.
Outside! Move!  
(The other prisoners shout as Jamie, Colin and Ben are dragged from the cell
and out of the gaol.)

**[Inverness - Sea Eagle inn corridor]**

SENTRY: Now, look lively!  
(The prisoners are pushed along a corridor, past an old woman struggling with
a large pot. Ben nearly knocks her over.)  
BEN: Sorry.  
TRASK: Watch your feet, you swab. Out of the way, you. Right, open up.  
(A sentry unlocks a door and Trask motions the prisoners into a bare wooden
room.)  
SENTRY: Come on through. Get a move on, now. Step lively.

**[Inverness - Sea Eagle room]**

JAMIE: Where's your friend?  
BEN: Polly? I don't know. Safe, I hope.  
JAMIE: And Kirsty, too. They're well out of it. But I mean the Doctor.  
BEN: I dunno. He'll be here though, don't worry.  
JAMIE: Yeah, in a wee moment it'll just be too late.  
TRASK: Silence, you two! Unless ye wants a taste of this! Right, you're all
going down there. Right, Pat lad, down he goes.  
(Wooden steps lead down through a trap door to a small landing stage where a
rowing boat is moored. Jamie and Ben help Colin clamber down.)

**[Rowing boat]**

(A small group of prisoners are huddled at the stern of the boat, with two of
Trask's men at the oars.)  
SENTRY: Right, Mister Trask, that's the lot.  
BEN: Well, where are you taking us?  
TRASK: You'll find out soon enough.  
JAMIE: You've not a mind to drown us, have you?  
TRASK: Ha! Wouldn't pollute the firth with ye. Get in the boat.  
BEN: Quick, we can make a break for it and swim.  
JAMIE: I can't swim.  
BEN: Now you tell me.  
TRASK: In the boat!  
(Ben gets into the boat with Jamie and Colin. The prisoners are manacled,)  
TRASK: Right. Off.

**[Inverness - Sea Eagle room]**

(The trap door is closed by the soldiers. The old woman is the Doctor in
disguise and 'she' appears in the doorway.)  
SENTRY: All right, Fred. Come on, let's move.  
DOCTOR: But, officer  
SENTRY: Go away, will you.  
DOCTOR: I've bought a wee drop of broth for Mister Trask.  
SENTRY: Well, he's not here, miss. He's gone. He's not here.  
DOCTOR: Will you have it officer? It's a pity to waste a nice hot broth. Do
you good.  
SENTRY: Oh, all right, I'll have it. It's a cold night outside anyway. What
are you looking at? There's not enough here for two. Go on, get back to your
post! Go! Move!  
(He sends out the soldiers and the old woman, then goes in the opposite
direction. The Doctor reappears, delighted that the door has not been locked.
He goes back in and opens the trap door.)

**[Ship Annabelle]**

(On the deck is a man tied hand and foot, supported by two sailors.)  
TRASK: Belay there, you swabs! In case you're thinking of escaping, there's
Jim Hughes for you. He didn't find it an happy ship, so I'll find him another
berth where he'll be happy!  
(The bound man is thrown over board, sinking instantly.)  
TRASK: Once aboard the Annabelle, that's the only way you'll get off her.
Straight downwards! Arr.

__**Episode Three**__

**[Annabelle's hold]**

(The hold is packed full of captured Highlanders huddled together in the half-
light. Ben, Jamie and Colin are forced down the ladder.)  
TRASK: Get in there!  
BEN: But there's no room.  
TRASK: Room enough for rebels. Get stored below.  
BEN: What have you got down here, stinking fish?  
TRASK: That's exactly what it is, stinking fish.  
JAMIE: Well, I'm not going.  
TRASK: Yes you are, you scurvy swab. Another word out of you and I'll be down
here with my cutlass. You'll learn who's master here.  
(There's lots of coughing from the residents.)  
BEN: Oh, you can hardly breathe.  
COLIN: At least we're alive.  
JAMIE: Are you feeling better, sir?  
COLIN: Greatly recovered, thank you, Jamie. My fever's going.  
JAMIE: Aye, it'll be no better for being cooped up in this hell hole.  
BEN: Yeah, for how long though? And where are they sending us?  
COLIN: Who kens.  
BEN: What?  
JAMIE: Who knows?  
BEN: Well, someone here might. Hey mate, got any idea where they're sending
us?  
WILLY: Beware. They're spies.  
BEN: What?  
WILLY: This man's an Englishman. One more blow we can strike for Scotland.  
BEN: Ay? What are you talking about?  
WILLY: One more piece of vermin to be stamped out.  
BEN: What are you going to do?  
WILLY: Put the foot into him and tramp his English bones into the deck. Back!
Back! I discovered him. The first blow will be mine.  
COLIN: Will MacKay would never strike a friend of the Prince.  
WILLY: I know that voice.  
COLIN: Ye havna been away so long you don't recognise me.  
WILLY: Ach, man, it's yourself. Colin McLaren.  
COLIN: And Jamie, son of Donald McCrimmon. A piper, like his father and his
father's father.  
JAMIE: With no pipes though, just my chanter.  
WILLY: Ah, wee Jimmy. But this Englishman, he is a friend to our Prince?  
COLIN: He is a friend of mine. He helped bring me here, weak but alive.  
WILLY: Ach well now, I crave your pardon. A friend of the McLaren's is a
friend of mine.  
BEN: Well thanks, I'm glad to hear it.  
WILLY: Then how came he here with you?  
JAMIE: Who, Ben? He's a deserting English sailor. So we take him back home.  
WILLY: A sailor. I'm a man of the sea myself. The master of this very vessel.  
BEN: If you're the skipper here, what's that Trask geezer doing on the bridge?  
WILLY: That shark was my mate. I was running arms from France past the
blockade. Trask betrayed me. The Navy boarded the Annabelle and now he's
sailing the ship for King George!  
BEN: Oh yeah?  
WILLY: You doubt my word?  
BEN: Oh no, skipper, just the bit about working for King George.  
WILLY: What do you mean?  
BEN: Well, we're not exactly being treated like prisoners of war, now are we?
Doesn't it occur to you that this Trask could be using this vessel without the
knowledge of his King and Sovereign in order to work some big fiddle on his
own account?  
WILLY: Fiddle?  
BEN: Look, mate, he is going to sell us like the stinking fish he thinks we
are. Slave labour, that's what we're going to be, slave labour!

**[Barn]**

(On the outskirts of Inverness, Polly is waiting for Kirsty. There is a noise
outside, so she looks out to see an old tinker passing by, leading a donkey
laden with pots and pans. Polly plays with the dirk Kirsty has left her,
stabbing at the air, but ends up dropping it. Another noise makes Polly turn
around.)  
POLLY: Kirsty! You gave me such a fright.  
KIRSTY: I'm not used to fetching and carrying, you know. We used to have our
own servants.  
POLLY: That's obvious. Did you get everything?  
KIRSTY: Aye, the clothes for you and trays and oranges. But, what so we have
to spend our money on oranges for?  
POLLY: You'll see. Hey, these are great. Last time we went back to the past I
had to wear boy's clothes all the time.  
KIRSTY: What?  
POLLY: Now then. How do I look?  
KIRSTY: Bonnie enough.  
POLLY: Okay, the next thing is the oranges. In the trays.  
KIRSTY: You're not going to have us selling oranges, are ye?  
POLLY: What? I haven't got it wrong, have I? You do have orange sellers, don't
you? I mean Nell Gwyn and all that?  
KIRSTY: Nell Gwyn? Well, of course there are orange sellers in Scotland. But
they're mostly coarse common girls.  
POLLY: The sort that hang around soldiers.  
KIRSTY: Yes.  
POLLY: Right, then we're going to be orange sellers.  
KIRSTY: What?  
POLLY: Well look, how else can we find out where they've taken the Doctor and
your father?  
KIRSTY: But if they catch us.  
POLLY: We still have a friend.  
KIRSTY: Who?  
POLLY: Algernon F-finch. Always assuming he's got out of that terrible pit.

**[Inverness - Sea Eagle dining room]**

(The room is full. A group of soldiers are playing cards. The Doctor is still
disguised as an old woman. When Ffinch enters, all the soldiers stand to
attention.)  
FFINCH: Sit down. Sit down. Wench! Get me some wine. Come on, hurry up, woman.
At last. Be off with you. I'll pay later. That's better. That's better.  
(Sergeant Clegg arrives with two orange sellers.)  
SERGEANT: All right, you two, in here and see the officer. Go on, in you go.
Get in there.  
KIRSTY: Put your hands off me or I'll scalp the hide off ye!  
POLLY: Kirsty, be quiet!  
KIRSTY: I'm not having a great ugly Englishman laying hands on me! Filthy.  
POLLY: Keep quiet, Kirsty, you'll give away the game.  
SERGEANT: Over here, both of you.  
KIRSTY: Will you stop that! Stop it! You'll pay for this.  
SERGEANT: All right you scum, get back! Get out or you'll be flayed alive. Go
on.  
KIRSTY: Oh, you're so brave, Sergeant.  
SERGEANT: Very funny. Over there.  
POLLY: Algy. Algernon.  
FFINCH: What?  
POLLY: Algernon. Hey, wake up. Wake up, Algy.  
FFINCH: Oh no!  
SERGEANT: These two look like the rebels we were searching for yesterday, sir.  
POLLY: What a nasty man. Tell him we're not, Algy, dear.  
FFINCH: Oh, just a minute.  
KIRSTY: Aye, we're old friends.  
SERGEANT: I can see that.  
FFINCH: Well, that's all, Sergeant. Be about your business.  
SERGEANT: Sir. All right, you scum, out of it! The King doesn't pay you to lay
around here all day. Go on, out, all of you. The last one out gets five
hundred lashes. Now go on, beat it! Out!  
(Clegg follows the soldiers out into the street.)  
FFINCH: This is really too much.  
POLLY: Oh, Algy, we thought you'd be flattered. We turned to you for help
immediately, didn't we Kirsty?  
KIRSTY: Just the sort of man two defenceless girls would turn to.  
FFINCH: I'll have you thrown in prison.  
POLLY: Alfred Algernon Thomas  
FFINCH: Quiet. What more do you want from me? Stab me, you've taken all my
money. I haven't even the price of a glass of wine left on me.  
POLLY: I don't suppose the Doctor and the others have a glass of water to
drink, never mind wine. Now, where are they?  
FFINCH: How should I know? In prison, I expect, where they belong.  
KIRSTY: They're not, we've checked. Now where are they?  
FFINCH: I don't know. I just round them up. You'll have to ask Solicitor Grey.
He's in charge of prisoners, not me.  
POLLY: Where is he?  
FFINCH: He's got a room somewhere near here. Can I go? Dash it, I haven't had
a wink of sleep yet.  
POLLY: Oh, you poor thing. Go on. But be careful. Not a word to anyone.  
(The Doctor tries to attract Polly's attention as Ffinch leaves, meeting
Perkins coming in.)  
FFINCH: Two wenches there to see the Solicitor.  
(Perkins bumps into the Doctor.)  
PERKINS: Oh, I beg your pardon, madam. Kindly sit down here. Cedric Perkins,
Solicitor's Clerk, ladies, at your service. What can I do for you?  
POLLY: Where is the Solicitor?  
PERKINS: Seeing to his duties. Giving some rebel prisoners the choice between
life and death.

**[Annabelle's hold]**

TRASK: Silence there, you bilge rats! And quiet! Pipe down there. Quiet. The
Solicitor hath news for ye.  
GREY: Rebels, your attention. A mark of clemency from his most gracious
Majesty King George.  
TRASK: Get down! Get down!  
GREY: This clemency can be withdrawn, so hark ye.  
WILLY: We're harking to ye.  
GREY: It has pleased his Majesty to declare, that whereas there are a great
many of his rebellious subjects in gaol, a speedy example must be made of
them.  
COLIN: Ah, clemency.  
GREY: Therefore it is ordained that there will be those required as witnesses.  
JAMIE: Traitors, you mean.  
GREY: Witnesses. Those not wanting to turn King's evidence will be hanged.  
TRASK: Pipe down! Pipe down, you dogs!  
GREY: Wait! There is, there is another alternative. Thank you, Mister Trask.  
TRASK: Arr!  
GREY: Plantation workers are required to work in his Majesty's colonies in the
West Indies. I have here seven year contracts. Sign your name to these and you
will receive free transportation to your new homes. Well? Which of you lucky
lads will be the first to sign?  
(One of the Highlanders goes to the table.)  
WILLY: Don't touch that pen! I know fine what you offer, Mister Solicitor. I
have seen these plantations in the Indies. Not one of you men that signs will
live out your seven years. Better a quick and honourable death at the end of a
rope, than a long slow one after months of  
GREY: Who is this man?  
TRASK: Willy MacKay, former master of this vessel. I should have done for him
long ago.  
GREY: Later, Trask, later. Listen to me, all of you. You've heard what MacKay
here offers you. Death with honour? What, lingering on the end of a halter?
Followed, may I remind you, by quartering and the like courtesies extended to
rebels. I offer you life, with a chance to work for your eventual liberty.  
WILLY: Liberty?  
GREY: Unless of course, Mister MacKay, you would care to turn King's evidence.
For the rest of you, for those who wish to sign, over here. For those who wish
to hang, over there. Make your choice!  
(Only Jamie, Ben, Willy and Colin don't line up to sign.)  
TRASK: Right, line up over here. That's it, stand in a line ye. Now, pipe
down. Get those signatures on the contract. Pipe down there!  
GREY: Well, well, MacKay. Only four for the gallows?  
BEN: Now hang on a minute  
JAMIE: No, Ben, you can't!  
COLIN: Oh, let him go, let him go.  
BEN: I'm not a Scots, but can I sign?  
GREY: Why not?  
BEN: Can I read it first?  
GREY: Of course.  
(Ben starts to read, then tears the contracts to pieces.)  
TRASK: You scurvy swab!  
(Trask lashes out with the handle of his whip, knocking Ben down.)  
GREY: Clap him in irons. When I return with new contracts, we'll bind him and
drop him from the highest yard-arm.  
TRASK: Mister Solicitor, mark this!  
GREY: All of you! The next man who tries to oppose me will not be so
fortunate. See to it.  
TRASK: Right, Parker, clap him in irons.  
(The unconscious Ben is dragged off.)

**[Inverness - Sea Eagle inn]**

(Perkins is entertaining the uneasy Kirsty and Polly.)  
POLLY: Mister Grey doesn't seem to be coming. I think we'd better be off.  
PERKINS: Oh surely, ladies, you won't deprive an old fellow of your charming
company? I assure you he won't be long.  
POLLY: Nevertheless, I think  
PERKINS: I insist!  
POLLY: No!  
PERKINS: Very well, I shall rouse the watch. They may be interested in two
such genteel orange wenches. That's better. Now, to pass the time, what say
you to a nice round of whist.  
DOCTOR: (woman) You need four for whist.  
PERKINS: Kindly remove yourself, madam.  
DOCTOR: There's nothing nicer than a nice game of whist.  
PERKINS: Madam, I told you.  
DOCTOR: (normal) I'm sure you'll oblige an old woman.  
(The Doctor is pointing Grey's pistol at Perkins.)  
PERKINS: The German Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Perhaps you'd like to count the trumps?  
PERKINS: Well, I, er.  
DOCTOR: Oh dear, clubs. Would you like to deal, Polly orange wench.  
GREY: Perkins, I want. What the devil are you at, man?  
PERKINS: Well I, er. Well I, er. Just playing a round of cards, Mister Grey.
GREY: Indeed. Then you can just come up to my room. I want more contracts.  
POLLY: Mister Grey?  
GREY: Yes?  
POLLY: Nothing.  
GREY: Come along, Perkins, make haste.  
PERKINS: I have to go.  
DOCTOR: Not just yet. Remember, you have seen nothing.  
PERKINS: What?  
DOCTOR: Your eyes.  
PERKINS: Eyes?  
DOCTOR: Yes. You wouldn't want another headache, now would you?  
PERKINS: Oh, no, no, no. But er.  
DOCTOR: I tell you what we're going to do. We ladies are going to leave first,
but you are going to sit here, quietly, comfortably, for another ten minutes.  
PERKINS: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Before you leave, because I am going to watch you all the time. And if
you move  
PERKINS: Yes, I understand, sir.  
DOCTOR: Now, girls, let's leave this rough place. Ten minutes, remember?  
PERKINS: Ten minutes, Doctor. Ten minutes.

**[Barn]**

POLLY: Come on, it's quite safe. All right?  
DOCTOR: Very good, very good.  
POLLY: That horrible little man's face.  
KIRSTY: Twas a picture right enough.  
POLLY: Hey, why did he call you the German doctor, Doctor? Doctor, be careful!  
KIRSTY: You'll have the town upon us!  
(The Doctor has fired the pistol.)  
DOCTOR: It's not loaded. They're dangerous things.  
POLLY: You know, those dresses really do suit you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oh, you saucy girl.  
KIRSTY: You're the very image of my old granny McLaren.  
POLLY: You're wonderful, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: I know.  
POLLY: You've even managed to cheer old Kirsty up.  
KIRSTY: Oh, aye. I'd forgotten.  
POLLY: Now what are we going to do?  
DOCTOR: Do? What do you mean, do?  
POLLY: Doctor, don't go all sleepy on us now. We've got to do something.  
DOCTOR: All right, go ahead.  
POLLY: If only we knew where the others were.  
DOCTOR: They're on the ship.  
POLLY: What?  
DOCTOR: They're on the ship, the Annabelle. Master's name, Trask. Not a nice
man. You wouldn't like him.  
(The Doctor lies back in the hay and closes his eyes.)  
POLLY: Doctor! Doctor! Look, if they're on the ship, then we've got to get
them off it. Or  
DOCTOR: Or what?  
POLLY: Or capture the ship.  
KIRSTY: What would we do that for?  
POLLY: Well, couldn't you sail to somewhere safe? I mean, wasn't France your
ally, or something?  
KIRSTY: I won't leave Scotland.  
DOCTOR: It'd be safer.  
KIRSTY: Never.  
DOCTOR: Well it wouldn't be for very long. Just for seven, just for a few
years, and then it'd be safe to come back.  
KIRSTY: But why should I leave my own country?  
DOCTOR: Oh, please yourself. But you and your father may get killed if you
stay in the glens.  
KIRSTY: Are you sure there's no other way?  
POLLY: Look, the Doctor says it won't be for long.  
KIRSTY: What must we do?  
POLLY: We must make a plan. Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
POLLY: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Hmm!  
POLLY: Have you got a plan for us?  
DOCTOR: No.  
POLLY: Oh, go on, I know you better than that. You must have a plan.  
DOCTOR: Well, it's just a wee idea really.  
POLLY: Go on.  
DOCTOR: I've only just thought about it. It won't work, but it'd be a try.
Anyone got any money?  
POLLY: Yes, seventeen guineas that we pinched from the English Lieutenant.  
DOCTOR: That's a fortune in these days. Now, we want weapons, lots of them,
and a rowing boat.  
KIRSTY: I can get a rowing boat.  
DOCTOR: Good, and we can buy the weapons.  
POLLY: Can we?  
DOCTOR: From the English soldiers. Well, they're bound to have heaps of
weapons as souvenirs.  
POLLY: Yes, but will they sell them to us?  
DOCTOR: You don't know the English soldier. He'd sell his grandmother for
tuppence ha'penny.  
KIRSTY: And then?  
DOCTOR: We smuggle them aboard the Annabelle.  
POLLY: That's great. And then what?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know, we'll think of something. I must get some sleep.  
POLLY: Doctor! Doctor! Oh.

**[Annabelle deck]**

(Perkins and Grey have been rowed over. Grey goes aboard, followed by Perkins
carrying the papers.)  
GREY: Mister Trask! Devil take him, where is the man? Mister Trask! Ah, you.
Go and fetch Mister Trask. Mister Trask!  
TRASK: Aye?  
GREY: Is everything in readiness?  
TRASK: It is.  
GREY: I've had Perkins here copy out three contracts, just to make sure. And
if anyone tries that trick again of tearing them up, shoot him down
immediately.  
TRASK: Don't you worry about that.  
GREY: We need two of the contracts to be signed.  
TRASK: Every man jack of them will sign. If not with ink, then with blood. Tis
all the one to me.  
GREY: No. You're not dealing with slaves, man. These Highlanders are men of
high courage and resolution. Flog but one of them, they'll all stand together
and refuse to sign a thing. You'll undo everything I've worked for. No, once
they're safely sold in Barbados they can be whipped to death for all I care.
Until then, use a light fist, or you'll answer to me.  
TRASK: And the London deserter, what about him?  
GREY: Proceed with the ducking. It'll serve as a useful encouragement to the
rest. Perkins, go below. Make the preparations.  
PERKINS: Yes, sir.  
GREY: And, Perkins, bring the deserter on deck.  
PERKINS: Of course, sir.

**[Barn]**

(Polly and Kirsty have obtained a meagre supply of weapons and are waiting for
the Doctor to come back.)  
POLLY: Haven't done very well, have we?  
KIRSTY: They wouldn't take me seriously.  
POLLY: No, nor me. I do hope the Doctor's had better luck. (knocking) Who's
there?  
DOCTOR [OC}: Me.  
(The Doctor pushes in a small hand barrow covered with a tarpaulin.)  
POLLY: Let's see, Doctor. What have you got?  
DOCTOR: No. Let's see yours first.  
POLLY: Oh look, don't tease us. Look.  
DOCTOR: Oh. It's a start.  
(The Doctor reveals a large pile of swords, muskets, and pistols.)  
KIRSTY: You must have robbed the Duke's arsenal.  
DOCTOR: Yes, something like that.  
POLLY: You're fantastic.  
DOCTOR: I know.  
KIRSTY: Look, there's a bonnie one.  
DOCTOR: Just a minute.  
KIRSTY: What is it?  
DOCTOR: This ring. Now, let me see.  
POLLY: Oh, that. It's her father's. She won't let you touch it.  
DOCTOR: I'm not surprised. It's not her father's.  
KIRSTY: You're lying!  
POLLY: What!  
KIRSTY: It is!  
DOCTOR: Then why has it the Stuarts' seal?  
KIRSTY: My father bade me not tell where he got it.  
DOCTOR: Until the right time. That time has now arrived.  
KIRSTY: The Prince gave it to my father off his own hand in heat of battle. My
father saved the Prince's life.  
DOCTOR: Then it is right and proper that it should now save his life. Give it
me. Thank you. I wonder. Bait.  
KIRSTY: What?  
DOCTOR: Bait for a very greedy man.

**[Annabelle deck]**

(Ben is carried on deck with his arms and legs bound. Another rope is tied
around his waist.)  
TRASK: Right, lads, take him up.  
(Ben is hoisted into the air and swung out over the side of the ship. At a
signal from Trask he is dropped into the water. A stream of bubbles rises to
the surface.)

__**Episode Four**__

**[Annabelle deck]**

(At last, Trask signals for Ben to be hauled up again. But there is no one on
the end of the rope.)  
GREY: He's not escaped?  
(On the other side of the ship, Ben surfaces in the shadows. He catches his
breath then swims for the shore. A fog descends and he loses track of the
time.)

**[Quayside]**

(Finally he reaches the quay and just manages to pull himself onto the jetty.
After a few gasps, he looks up to see the business end of a musket.)  
BEN: Oh, no. Not after all that. I give up.  
(The soldier peels off his moustache.)  
BEN: It's you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Who else would be walking around the jetty at this time of night
dressed like a soldier who'd been wounded in battle?  
BEN: Yeah, you've got a point there. But why?  
DOCTOR: Why? Because I like it here. Besides, it keeps the other soldiers
away.  
BEN: Oh, I'm cold and hungry.  
DOCTOR: I know just the place. Hold that. I'll just get these things aboard
the boat.  
BEN: The boat?  
DOCTOR: Just a few wee gifties for our friends aboard the Annabelle. Come on.

**[Captain's cabin]**

PERKINS: There you are, sir, all signed and attested. It but wants your
signature.  
GREY: Not before time.  
TRASK: A little wine for your cold heart, lawyer?  
GREY: I never mix liquor with business. I would advise you to do the same. We
sail on the morning tide, remember.  
TRASK: Happen it's too foggy to sail, what then?  
GREY: (sternly) You sail, fog or no fog.  
TRASK: And crash the old girl's timbers on Chanonry Point.  
GREY: I took you for a seaman.  
TRASK: Why, that I am. I am! Trask'll get your cargo of little booties to
Barbados, never fear. That's what really counts, lawyer. Not those dried up
bits of parchment of yours.  
GREY: Without these bits of parchment, we would all sail foul of the King's
law.  
TRASK: Law? What does the law or anyone care for those Highland cattle we
carry?  
GREY: Nothing. But to take these cattle safely to the slave plantations,
before their strength is sapped by his Majesty's prisons, that takes skill and
preparation.  
TRASK: And what would happen to you and me if this trade were to be discovered
to the Duke?  
GREY: That will never happen, Trask. There are but three of us privy to this
secret. I can answer for myself and Perkins. Ay, Perkins?  
PERKINS: Oh, yes sir. Yes sir, indeed you may.  
GREY: As for you, Captain, you must answer for yourself.  
TRASK: Twas but in jest. You know me, Solicitor. I'm your man.  
GREY: Aye, and that is the way you will remain, Mister Trask.

**[Barn]**

(Ben is finishing off a meal of stew and bread.)  
BEN: Ah, that's better. Never thought I'd live to see a meal like that again.  
POLLY: But listen Ben, how did you manage to get loose? Underwater, I mean?  
BEN: Well it's the old Houdini trick, duchess. You flex your muscles when they
tie you up, then when you're ready, you relax them. Well that way you're half
the size you were before. Get it?  
KIRSTY: No.  
POLLY: And that's all there is to it?  
BEN: Well, almost all.  
POLLY: I bet.  
POLLY: Hey you've got your own clothes back.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Can you imagine, I found them thrown out on the rubbish dump,
behind the inn.  
BEN: Amazing, isn't it? Well mine should be dry by now.  
POLLY: I liked you better in your dress, Doctor.  
KIRSTY: Aye, you made a good granny.  
DOCTOR: Now then, do we all know what we have to do? Ben?  
BEN: Yeah, I take you out to the ship in the rowing boat. Then double round
the back smartish while they're sorting you out, and then pass the weapons
through the porthole.  
POLLY: While Kirsty and I just sit here and wait for you to get back, if you
ever do. No fear.  
KIRSTY: We've done enough waiting.  
DOCTOR: But it may be dangerous. They may not swallow my story.  
BEN: Yeah, and they may see me in the boat, even with this on.  
(Ben pulls a tam-o'-shanter over his face.)  
DOCTOR: I would like a hat like that.  
POLLY: Nevertheless, we're not going to let you two out of our sights, are we,
Kirsty? Well, you get into such terrible trouble without us.  
DOCTOR: Very well, you shall come in the rowing boat. It might be a good idea
at that.  
BEN: Well, what do you want me to do now?  
DOCTOR: I've got another idea for you, Ben.

**[Annabelle's hold]**

WILLY: I can hardly believe it. They've played right into Solicitor Grey's
hands. My own crew amongst them.  
COLIN: Can you blame them? It's a poor choice between the gallows and the
plantations. A man will clutch at any straw to save his skin.  
JAMIE: And what will they do with us, sir?  
COLIN: I fear they will make an example of us, once Trask gets away to sea.  
WILLY: He'll not let me live, that's for sure. Ach well, better a fast death
than a lingering one under the overseers. I've no regrets.  
COLIN: If I could see my Kirsty again, I'd die content.

**[Captain's cabin]**

GREY: Three thousand five hundred guineas. You will collect this amount in
gold on delivery of the prisoners and render strict accounting to me. Is that
clear?  
PERKINS: Yes, sir, Mister Grey, sir. Quite clear, sir. You may trust me to the
death, sir.  
GREY: Now I must return ashore. I shall expect to see you in London at the end
of October. Meanwhile, keep a close eye on Trask. He's not  
TRASK [OC]: Right lads, bring him down.  
(Trask flings open the door and the Doctor is dragged in.)  
DOCTOR: Want to see him.  
TRASK: Us has got company, Mister Solicitor. Caught him coming over the side,
bold as a welsh pirate.  
DOCTOR: (German) And of my own free will. I'm delighted to meet you again,
Mister Solicitor Grey.  
GREY: You may not be so delighted when we part company this time, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: If you'd ask these fellows to let go of my arms, I have a small token
for you.  
GREY: Indeed. I have not forgotten the last one. All right, let him go.  
TRASK: Let me have him. I'll soon change his tune.  
GREY: Silence! Perkins, the door.  
PERKINS: Please?  
GREY: Well, go on.  
DOCTOR: Now then, let me see, where did I put it. No, it's not in there. I
transferred it from there, into this pocket. Well it's not there now, perhaps
it's in here.  
TRASK: Why, you!  
GREY: I would advise you to find this token quickly, before I leave you to the
tender mercies of Mister Trask.  
DOCTOR: Got it!  
(The Doctor produces Kirsty's ring.)  
DOCTOR: Here we are. Look at the seal.  
GREY: The Stuart arms.  
DOCTOR: Well, Mister Grey?  
GREY: Where did you get this?  
DOCTOR: From the hands of Prince Charles himself.  
GREY: Where, man, where?  
DOCTOR: In prison.  
GREY: I don't follow.  
DOCTOR: It's perfectly easy. Prince Charles disguised himself as a Highlander
and was taken prisoner with the rest of the rebels.  
GREY: And where is he now?  
DOCTOR: I wonder what that information would be worth? Now let me see.  
TRASK: I'll burn it out of him.  
GREY: No! How much do you think it to be worth, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Well, shall we say, ten thousand guineas?

**[Annabelle's hold]**

(Polly and Kirsty bring the rowing boat alongside the ship. Kirsty looks
through a gun port. Nothing, so they move on to the next. Further on still,
she finally finds her father.)  
KIRSTY [OC]: Father. Father.  
COLIN: Hmm?  
KIRSTY [OC]: Father.  
COLIN: Aye, my child.  
KIRSTY [OC]: Father, listen to me.  
COLIN: I hear you, Kirsty.  
KIRSTY [OC]: Father, it's me. It's Kirsty. I'm here.  
COLIN: (waking) Aye. Ah, I must be dreaming. Kirsty.  
KIRSTY [OC]: Whist, keep your voice down.  
COLIN: Where are you?  
KIRSTY [OC]: I'm outside here, in a boat.  
COLIN: My child, are you well? They havna harmed you?  
KIRSTY [OC]: Father, I'm fine. And you?  
COLIN: Better. A world better for hearing your voice. But you canna stay
there. They'll find you.  
KIRSTY [OC]: Here, then, take this.  
(Kirsty passes a pistol through the port hole.)  
COLIN: It's a miracle. I must be in a dream.  
KIRSTY [OC]: Father, it's no dream. We've got arms for all of you and a plan.
Can you come closer? Right, now listen.

**[Captain's cabin]**

GREY: You drive a hard bargain, Doctor, but no matter. I agree. Now, where is
he?  
DOCTOR: The very last place you would think of looking for him.  
GREY: Well?  
DOCTOR: Right here on this ship.  
TRASK: Let me have him!  
GREY: A dangerous jest!  
DOCTOR: Did you mark the young Highlander who was with me? The piper?  
GREY: Piper?  
DOCTOR: With the soft hands and face?  
GREY: No.  
DOCTOR: Did you notice his hair? Unmistakable, that was the Prince.  
GREY: You had better be very sure.  
DOCTOR: Would I come and place myself in your hands if I was not very sure?  
TRASK: We'll smell out the Pretender right now, by heaven.  
GREY: Come along then. Perkins.  
DOCTOR: Aren't you forgetting one thing?  
GREY: What?  
DOCTOR: I'm the only one who knows what he looks like.  
GREY: Bring him along then. Make haste.

**[Annabelle's hold]**

(The Highlanders are apparently asleep. Trask enters quietly, followed by
Grey, Perkins, the Doctor and two armed sailors.)  
LOOKOUT: (sotto) Go to sleep.  
TRASK: In here, Doctor.  
GREY: Quiet. If they have any suspicion of whom we're looking and know him to
be here  
TRASK: Arr. Come on, Doctor. Him? Him?  
DOCTOR: No.  
TRASK: What about him?  
DOCTOR: No. Perhaps he is further over.  
GREY: If you have made a mistake.  
DOCTOR: I've found him. He's the little one, over there.  
(The Doctor points at Jamie, over on the far side.)  
COLIN: Creag an tuire!  
(The Highlanders leap up, armed with sword, pistol and musket. The two sailors
try to run but are cut off and surrender. Grey and Perkins do likewise. Only
Trask tries to fight, so Willy comes forward to take his revenge.)  
JAMIE: Creag an tuire!  
(Jamie leads the Highlanders out on deck. Willy is weakening in the fight, but
manages to stab Trask's shoulder.)  
WILLY: Now I shall relieve you of your command!  
TRASK: Not yet, Willy MacKay!  
(Trask wounds him and heads up on deck.)

**[Annabelle's deck]**

(The fighting continues with the sailors being driven back to the poop deck.)  
TRASK: Right, lads, to me! Throw the scurvy swabs over the side! I'm still
master here!  
BEN: Not for long, mate.  
TRASK: You! I'll make sure of you this time, lad.  
(Trask advances on Ben, cutlass raised. Ben trips and falls. Jamie swings
across on a rope and knocks Trask down. Ben gets out of the way as Jamie
forces Trask to the ship's rail, where he goes overboard as Willy comes on
deck.)  
WILLY: Where's Trask?  
JAMIE: In the firth.  
WILLY: Good lad. Hold! Come back! Hold! All of ye. I want men. Get them over
here. That's right, we sail for France on the next tide. I want willing hands.
If you hadn't volunteered you'd have had a long cold swim for it. Right now,
make ready. Off with ye, go on! Up to the top. Off with ye!  
(As the sailors set to, the Doctor comes on deck and helps Kirsty and Polly on
board.)  
DOCTOR: Ben, well done, well done, well done. Kirsty, here's your father.
There we are. Polly  
KIRSTY: Father!  
DOCTOR: Got lost in the fog.  
POLLY: Well done, well done.  
BEN: Oh, don't over do it, Pol.  
POLLY: But we've won!  
DOCTOR: Only for the moment.  
POLLY: What do you mean?  
BEN: Well, the real job's only just beginning. Getting back to the Tardis with
only a rough idea of where it is and the whole English army out to stop us.  
POLLY: What are we going to do?  
BEN: Well, we're going to get ashore before they get under way. That's the
first thing. Right, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Right.  
WILLY: Stand by the capstan.  
DOCTOR: We have to go ashore now.  
WILLY: Oh, don't bother me now, man. Stand by at the end of the rope here.  
COLIN: What about the prisoners?  
DOCTOR: We'll take Mister Grey ashore as a hostage.  
COLIN: And the clerk?  
DOCTOR: Well I  
PERKINS: Now, may I have converse with you.  
COLIN: Yea, man, yea.  
PERKINS: Don't send me ashore with that man, sir. Now, if you are going to
France, then maybe you can do with a secretary. Especially one who is
conversant with the French tongue.  
COLIN: Shifting with the wind, you rogue. Well, Doctor, what do you say?  
DOCTOR: Many of your people speak French?  
COLIN: Aye, but little.  
DOCTOR: Then take him with you. He'll stay loyal enough.  
PERKINS: Oh, I will, I will, sir.  
DOCTOR: Till the wind shifts again. Laird, we must go.  
COLIN: Doctor, I  
DOCTOR: Bring the prisoner over!  
PERKINS: Mister Solicitor!  
GREY: Well, Perkins?  
(Perkins snaps his fingers at Grey.)  
PERKINS: I've been wanting to do that for a long time. You've no idea the
pleasure that gave me.  
GREY: Why you  
PERKINS: Sir.

**[Quayside]**

POLLY: I can't even see the ship.  
BEN: No, they said they'd send us a signal before they went. Hey, look. There
it is!  
(A small light waves across the firth and vanishes.)  
POLLY: Do you think they'll beat the English blockade?  
DOCTOR: The fog will help them. More than it will help us.  
POLLY: We never even said goodbye to Jamie.  
BEN: No, he just disappeared. I wonder where he went to.  
JAMIE: Right here.  
BEN: Jamie!  
POLLY: Jamie!  
JAMIE: Aye, himself.  
BEN: Well, why didn't you go with the others?  
JAMIE: Well, let's say I fancied my chances here better. Besides, you'll need
someone to guide you through the glen, won't you?  
BEN: How did you know?  
DOCTOR: Glad to have you with us, Jamie.  
POLLY: But won't you be in danger here though?  
JAMIE: Ach, if they can survive here, so can I.  
BEN: Hey, watch it! Quick, through these doors.

**[Boathouse]**

(Ben and Jamie drag Grey inside as two soldiers appear.)  
POLLY: They're going away. It's all right.  
GREY: Help!  
JAMIE: One more move and you're a dead man.  
DOCTOR: They heard.  
POLLY: But what if they find us?  
DOCTOR: Shh.  
(The soldiers enter, see nothing and turn to leave.)  
GREY: Mmph!  
(Ben and Jamie tackle one Redcoat as the Doctor grapples the other. They
overpower the soldiers and knock them out as Grey makes his escape.)  
JAMIE: I'm certainly glad I'm on your side.  
DOCTOR: Grey!  
POLLY: The window!  
DOCTOR: No. No, Ben. It's too late.  
BEN: But he was our hostage. They'll never let us get to the Tardis now!  
DOCTOR: We'll find someone else, eh, Polly?

**[Outside the Sea Eagle Inn]**

FFINCH: What the?  
(He turns to see Ben holding a pistol to his chest.)  
BEN: We want your company, mate.  
DOCTOR: If you don't mind.  
POLLY: You won't refuse us, Algy dear.  
FFINCH: Oh, this is really too much.  
POLLY: This way.  
COLONEL: Damn it, man. Where the devil do you think you're going?  
FFINCH: Colonel!  
COLONEL: Well, have you forgotten it's your deal, Ffinch?  
FFINCH: Yes, sir, I know. But, I was just  
COLONEL: Well, who are these vagabonds?  
FFINCH: Well, Colonel they're  
DOCTOR: (German) Doctor von Wer at your service. Remedies for the ague, the
twitch, the colic, the warts and the gout.  
COLONEL: The gout? I haven't got the gout.  
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't waste your time with that, a fine
healthy gentleman like yourself. No, it's this ring you see, sir.  
FFINCH: Perhaps we'd better get back to the game, sir. The night air.  
COLONEL: Oh, blast the night air. Let me see. The Pretender's ring! Where'd
you get this, man?  
DOCTOR: Well, you go up there and to the left. No perhaps it's better to
explain this way. To the right  
COLONEL: Look what are you talking about?  
DOCTOR: No. On second thought, perhaps the other way. We were taking the
Lieutenant, you see, sir.  
FFINCH: The game, sir.  
COLONEL: Confound the game, this is the Prince's ring. Go with them. Take an
attachment.  
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, sir.  
COLONEL: What?  
DOCTOR: That might frighten the blackguard, sir. We are enough to apprehend
him.  
COLONEL: All right, go on, Lieutenant. You have your orders, what are you
waiting for?  
FFINCH: Yes, sir. But, this wench  
(Polly starts to pull out Ffinch's ID disc which she is wearing around her
neck.)  
FFINCH: Yes, sir. Very good, sir.  
COLONEL: And when you have them  
DOCTOR: We will bring him back to you, sir. Right?  
COLONEL: Right.

**[Cottage]**

(Almost dawn.)  
JAMIE: You know where you are now?  
BEN: Yeah, I won't forget this place in a hurry.  
DOCTOR: Well, it's time we said goodbye, Lieutenant. And thank you.  
POLLY: I've been telling him all about Mister Grey's activities.  
BEN: Yeah, you want to nab him quick.  
POLLY: Oh, Algy, here you are and thank you very much.  
(Polly gives Ffinch his ID disc.)  
FFINCH: It was nothing.  
(Suddenly Redcoats appear and Grey walks in.)  
GREY: Ah, so you found these rebels, Lieutenant? Well done.  
FFINCH: No!  
GREY: You can escort them with me to Inverness. You will not escape the
gallows this time, Doctor. Any of you. As for you, wench, I'll have you tied
to the tail of a cart and whipped from one end of  
FFINCH: Silence!  
GREY: What was that you said?  
FFINCH: I've heard the whole story of your schemes from this young lady here.  
GREY: You take the word of this  
DOCTOR: What wicked times we live in, Lieutenant. A prison commissioner using
his office to smuggle rebels out of the country.  
GREY: You're wasting your breath, Doctor. It was all perfectly legal. The
rebels signed the contracts for transportation of their own free will.  
DOCTOR: Contracts? I don't believe I saw any contracts. Did you, Ben?  
BEN: No, I wouldn't know what they were.  
DOCTOR: Or you Jamie?  
JAMIE: Me? No.  
GREY: A lie, Lieutenant. The contracts were signed, I have them right here in
my  
DOCTOR: So sad. Once a promising legal talent.  
FFINCH: There is only one end for slave traders, Solicitor. I'm placing you
under arrest.  
GREY: I warn you, Lieutenant  
FFINCH: I've had enough of your warnings, sir. Gag him, Sergeant. Take him to
prison under escort.  
SERGEANT: Sir!  
GREY: No, wait! This is some sort of trick, you fool. If the Colonel hears of
this you'll be lucky to end up as a band master.  
FFINCH: Take him away, Sergeant.  
SERGEANT: Come on, you traitorous dog.  
GREY: Fool.  
SERGEANT: You men follow me.  
(The Redcoats remove Grey.)  
FFINCH: Well, goodbye, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Goodbye.  
BEN: Goodbye.  
POLLY: Wait. Algy, why did you do it?  
FFINCH: A chance to put paid to a villain, ma'am.  
POLLY: It wasn't just that, was it?  
FFINCH: Not quite, ma'am.  
POLLY: Thank you, Algy. (kiss) Goodbye.  
FFINCH: Well, I wouldn't linger here if I were you. These moors, you know,
they're still scouring them for rebels.  
DOCTOR: Goodbye.  
FFINCH: Goodbye.  
BEN: Ta-ta.  
JAMIE: One thing I don't understand. Where those contracts went?  
DOCTOR: I've no idea.  
(The Doctor pulls the papers from his pocket.)  
DOCTOR: Well how did they get there?  
BEN: You old fraud. Come on, we must go.  
POLLY: What about Jamie? We can't leave him here.  
DOCTOR: True. His ship's sailed.  
POLLY: What will you do?  
JAMIE: Oh, I'll be all right. They won't catch me.  
BEN: Did you hear that! They'll catch us all if we don't move fast.  
POLLY: Doctor, can we take him with us?  
DOCTOR: If he teaches me to play the bagpipes.  
JAMIE: If you want, Doctor.  
BEN: That's all we need. Come on.  
POLLY: Come on, Jamie.  
JAMIE: But where are we going?  
POLLY: You'll see.

**[Culloden moor]**

(The travellers return to the Tardis, and Jamie watches in amazement as the
Doctor unlocks the blue box and goes inside, followed by Ben. Jamie hesitates,
so Polly takes his hand and leads him in.)
