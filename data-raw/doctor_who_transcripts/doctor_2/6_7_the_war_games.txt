__**Episode One**__

**[No Man's Land]**

(A scene of mud and desolation. The Tardis materialises in a puddle, and Jamie
steps out into it. Zoe is sensibly wearing a trench coat, jodhpurs and knee
high boots.)  
JAMIE: What a place.  
ZOE: Where are we? Earth?  
DOCTOR: Well, it looks like it, Zoe. Come on.  
(They pick their way over and up a slope. The Doctor whistles 'A-hunting we
will go' happily to himself.)  
ZOE: What's this stuff?  
JAMIE: Aye, wee spikes.  
(Jamie pricks his finger.)  
DOCTOR: Barbed wire, Jamie. It's filthy stuff. I thought so.  
JAMIE: Eh?  
(The Doctor pulls a tin helmet from underneath some wood.)  
JAMIE: Where are we?  
DOCTOR: We're back in history, Jamie. One of the most terrible times on the
planet Earth.  
(Whee, boom!)  
DOCTOR: Quick! Down there!  
(They dive into a nearby bomb crater in the ground. Another shell explodes
nearby as Jamie stands to watch.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie!  
(More explosions and machine gun fire. They get splattered with soil. An army
ambulance comes trundling up through the explosions, then suddenly all goes
quiet. A woman in a great coat is standing by the crater.)  
BUCKINGHAM: I say, are you all right?  
DOCTOR: Well, yes, I think so.  
BUCKINGHAM: I shouldn't stay around here if I were you. That was just the
softening up barrage.  
DOCTOR: What?  
JAMIE: Eh?  
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh my. Oh.  
BUCKINGHAM: What on earth are you doing here, anyway? This is no place for
civilians.  
DOCTOR: Well, where are we?  
BUCKINGHAM: Between the lines, I think. Not quite sure myself. I'm heading for
Ypres, but I seem to have got  
(Two soldiers in gas masks are standing next to them.)  
GERMAN: HÃ¤nde hock. Raus schnell.  
(The four are taken at gunpoint to the ambulance and driven off. Buckingham is
behind the wheel. Further on, two men come running over a rise. Buckingham
stops the ambulance. The officer puts his revolver to the German's head.)  
CARSTAIRS: Out you come.  
(Played by  David Savile. I used to have such a crush on him.)  
BUCKINGHAM: There's another in the back.  
CARSTAIRS: Take care of him.  
(Carstairs leaves his soldier covering the man up front and goes to the back
of the ambulance. Jamie and the Doctor have already overpowered the other
German.)  
CARSTAIRS: Well done. Get inside.  
(The British and German soldiers are bundled into the back. Carstairs sits
next to Buckingham up front.)  
CARSTAIRS: Who are those people?  
BUCKINGHAM: No idea. Picked them up in no man's land.  
CARSTAIRS: Well, I suppose we'd better get them back to base.

**[Field office]**

(Adjoining the trench, Captain Blackadder is reporting up the telephone line.
Explosions are heard almost constantly.)  
BARRINGTON: They've laid down a heavy barrage all along the line. I think that
they're after that ammo dump. Don't worry, sir. We'll hold out.  
SERGEANT: Sir?  
BARRINGTON: What is it?  
SERGEANT: Ambulance approaching, sir.  
BARRINGTON: Give it protective fire. Jump to it. man!  
SERGEANT: Sir.

**[Trench]**

SERGEANT: Hold your fire! Hold it. Come on. Come on. Get down, get down.  
(Zoe makes her way behind the troops firing over the top of the trench as
Carstairs helps Buckingham, the Doctor and Jamie down.)  
CARSTAIRS: Couple of prisoners, Sergeant. My men are bringing them in.  
SERGEANT: Very good, sir.  
JAMIE: How are we going to get back to the Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Now, just be quiet, Jamie, and let me do the talking.

**[Field office]**

SERGEANT: Sir?  
BARRINGTON: What is it now?  
SERGEANT: With the ambulance, sir, there was a Lieutenant.  
BARRINGTON: Well, bring him in.  
SERGEANT: Sir.  
(The Sergeant leaves, Carstairs enters.)  
CARSTAIRS: Lieutenant Carstairs, sir.  
BARRINGTON: What are you doing here? You don't belong to this battalion, do
you?  
CARSTAIRS: No. Patrolling in no mans land, sir. I got cut off from my own lot.  
BARRINGTON: What were you doing traipsing about in ambulances?  
CARSTAIRS: Recaptured it from the Hun, sir. Lucky we arrived, really. There
was a WVR driving it, and three civilians inside.  
BARRINGTON: Civilians? In no man's land?  
CARSTAIRS: Your sergeant's taking care of them, sir.  
BARRINGTON: Good grief. Civilians.

**[Trench]**

(The travellers have been given mugs of tea.)  
JAMIE: The thing is, where are we?  
ZOE: Early twentieth century isn't it, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm afraid that we've landed up in the middle of one of the worst
wars in human history.  
JAMIE: What are they dug into the ground like this for?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's trench warfare, you see, Jamie. These trenches stretch
right the way across the continent of Europe.  
JAMIE: Well, what are they fighting for?  
DOCTOR: Well, I well I believe that they call it The War to End Wars.  
ZOE: Do you think they'll let us go?  
DOCTOR: Well, they've got no reason to keep us. Here, things have calmed down
a bit. Let's try and get away.  
(But as soon as he puts his head up over the top of the trench, machine gun
fire.)  
DOCTOR: Oh!  
SERGEANT: What do you think you're doing?  
DOCTOR: Our transportation is over there, you see. We're trying to get to it.  
SERGEANT: Over there? There's nothing over there but Huns. Anyway, the Major
wants to see you.  
DOCTOR: Oh, we don't want to bother him. I'm sure he's very busy.  
SERGEANT: Come on! You too, ma'am, if you don't mind.

**[Field office]**

BARRINGTON: Right, sir. We'll go over the top at oh four hundred hours. Sir.
As you say, sir. Well, that was General Smythe. Big push tomorrow. How long
have you been out here?  
CARSTAIRS: Well, sir, it's odd, but I can't quite remember.  
BARRINGTON: I know. It seems like forever, doesn't it?  
SERGEANT: Civilian party, sir. Major Barrington, ma'am.  
BARRINGTON: How do you do, er?  
BUCKINGHAM: Jennifer Buckingham.  
BARRINGTON: Ah. I understand you picked these people up in no man's land?  
BUCKINGHAM: Yes. Found them hiding in a bomb crater.  
BARRINGTON: I see. May I ask you what you were doing there?  
DOCTOR: Trying not to get killed.  
BARRINGTON: I see. You're a Highlander, aren't you? Why aren't you with your
regiment?  
JAMIE: Regiment? I'm not in the army.  
BARRINGTON: Are you a deserter?  
JAMIE: No, of course not! I  
BARRINGTON: All right, all right. And you, what are you doing in the front
line? No place for young ladies.  
ZOE: Well what about her?  
BARRINGTON: This lady's a WVR. She's here on duty.  
DOCTOR: Er, look, Major, we don't want to trouble you. If you'd just let us go
on our way.  
BARRINGTON: And which way is that?  
SERGEANT: He tried to make off towards the German line, sir.  
BARRINGTON: Did he, by jove.  
(Whee, Boom! Bits of ceiling come down.)  
BARRINGTON: I think General Smythe would like to know about you. (into
telephone) Get me General Smythe at base.

**[British command post]**

(The General sits at a simple folding table in a once great stately home,
talking into a field telephone.)  
SMYTHE: Civilians? In no man's land? Yes. Well, send them back here at once.
I'll question them myself.  
(The General's adjutant enters.)  
SMYTHE: Three civilians found in no man's land.  
RANSOM: Good lord. Whereabouts, sir?  
SMYTHE: Barrington's sector. He's sending them straight back here. I'm going
to turn in for half an hour.  
SMYTHE: Sir.  
SMYTHE: Let me know when these civilians arrive.  
RANSOM: Yes, sir.  
(The obligatory mug of tea arrives.)  
RANSOM: Thank you, Sergeant Major.

**[Smythe's room]**

(A wood panelled room with a large trunk on its end in the corner. Smythe
reaches for a portrait on the wall when the door opens. It's the Sergeant
Major with his mug of tea.)  
SMYTHE: Don't ever come through that door without knocking! Get out!  
BURNS: Right, sir.  
(He leaves. Smythe reaches for the portrait again and it swings open on hinges
to reveal a circular monitor and a dial. Smythe turns it on.)  
SMYTHE: Smythe, 1917 zone, British sector. Reinforcements urgently required.
At least five thousand specimens.

**[Field office]**

DOCTOR: But look, Major Barrington, if only you'd let us get back to our
transportation we'd be no further nuisance to you.  
BARRINGTON: I'm sorry, you must first go to the Chateau and give a proper
account of yourselves. For all I know you may be spies.  
JAMIE: Oh look, we keep trying to tell you, you daft sassenach.  
BARRINGTON: Hold your tongue, man!  
JAMIE: No, I won't!  
DOCTOR: Now please! Don't let us lose our tempers.  
SERGEANT: Supply truck leaving for base now, sir.  
BARRINGTON: Good. Get them onto it. Off you go.  
JAMIE: Now, just a moment, we're not going back to any base. Now, come on.  
BARRINGTON: Sentry!  
(Jamie's exit is stopped by a soldier and rifle.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie, I think perhaps we'd better do as they say.  
BARRINGTON: I'm glad one of you is showing some sense. All right, Sergeant,
take them away.  
SERGEANT: Yes, sir.  
BUCKINGHAM: I'm sure you'll be all right. Anyway, good luck.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much.  
(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe leave with the Sergeant.)  
BARRINGTON: Now then, what are we going to do about you two?  
BUCKINGHAM: Could your men do something about my ambulance? It's bogged down
just over the hill.  
BARRINGTON: Yes, soon get that out for you.  
(Barrington leaves.)  
BUCKINGHAM: Funny about those people. They didn't look like spies.  
CARSTAIRS: Spies never do. I don't envy them if they are. General Smythe can
be pretty ruthless. Know what my chaps call him?  
BUCKINGHAM: No.  
CARSTAIRS: The Butcher.

**[British command post]**

(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe are marched under escort into a large room in a
faded and dilapidated Chateau. A Sergeant Major gives the orders.)  
BURNS: Right, left, right, left, right, left, right. Prisoners and escort,
mark time! Halt! Right turn! Civilian prisoners from Major Barrington, sir.  
RANSOM: All right. At ease.  
BURNS: Stand at ease!  
(Jamie stamps his foot to the side, stepping on the Doctor.)  
BURNS: At ease.  
RANSOM: The General wants to question you personally.  
DOCTOR: Oh good. I'm sure we'll be able to explain everything to his
satisfaction.  
JAMIE: Look, how long are we going to be kept here?

**[Smythe's room]**

(The room is empty.)  
RANSOM: Sir?

**[British command post]**

RANSOM: Take them to the cells, Sergeant Major.  
DOCTOR: But I thought you said we were going to see the General?  
RANSOM: The General is not available. Take them away.  
BURNS: Prisoners and escort, attention! Right turn!  
(No, the other right, Jamie.)  
BURNS: By the front, quick march. Left, right, left, right.  
ZOE: There's no need to keep shouting at us, you know.  
SERGEANT MAJOR: Left, right, left, right, left.

**[Field office]**

(Carstairs pours himself some tea from a billy can.)  
CARSTAIRS: Oh, I'm sorry, do you want some more?  
BUCKINGHAM: Thanks.  
CARSTAIRS: Where is your hospital?  
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, it's not far.  
CARSTAIRS: Whereabouts?  
BUCKINGHAM: Well, you're going to think me awfully silly, but I can't quite
remember.  
CARSTAIRS: Don't worry, it'll come back to you. Memory's a funny thing out
here. Can't always remember things myself.  
BUCKINGHAM: What kinds of things?  
CARSTAIRS: Oh, silly things. Names, dates, how long I've been here. Sometimes
wonder if I've got a touch of the old shell shock. Have you talked to anybody
else about it?  
BUCKINGHAM: Haven't liked to. One feels so stupid.  
CARSTAIRS: Yes. Still, it is rather worrying not being able to remember
things.  
(The telephone rings.)  
CARSTAIRS: Ah. Suppose I'd better answer that.  
(Barrington rushes in and takes the receiver from Carstairs.)  
BARRINGTON: Ah, thanks, old man. Major Barrington. Yes. Right, sir. We're
wanted at HQ. Some sort of enquiry to do with those civilians you brought in.  
BUCKINGHAM: How long will it take? I'm bound to be needed back at the
hospital.  
BARRINGTON: We just got your ambulance out of the mud. We'll all go in that,
and then you can go straight on from HQ. Are you ready?

**[Wine cellar]**

(No bottles, just racks and barrels.)  
JAMIE: And you'll not pick that lock with a hairgrip either.  
ZOE: These walls are solid stone. There's just no way out.  
JAMIE: Now what do we do, then?  
DOCTOR: It's just a temporary misunderstanding, Jamie. We'll get it cleared up
when we see the General.  
ZOE: Why should he listen to us? No one else has.  
DOCTOR: Ah, they were all obeying orders, Zoe. That's the military mind.  
ZOE: We must have looked a bit suspicious. Three civilians in the middle of a
war?  
JAMIE: Aye, well, I just hope that General does listen to us.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I expect he's a very nice chap.

**[British command post]**

(Smythe comes out of his room.)  
SMYTHE: Got those reports yet?  
RANSOM: Just finished now, sir.  
SMYTHE: Thank you.  
RANSOM: By the way, sir, those three civilians have turned up. I've got them
in the cells.  
SMYTHE: Oh, what of it?  
RANSOM: As a matter of fact, I went into your room to tell you but  
(Smythe puts on his spectacles and stares at Ransom.)  
SMYTHE: I was asleep, Captain Ransom. You did not wish to disturb me.  
RANSOM: Yes, sir, you were asleep. I didn't wish to disturb you.  
SMYTHE: That's right. Now, what did you make of these civilians?  
RANSOM: Oh, two men and a young lady. According to Major Barrington they can't
account for themselves. He seemed to think the younger lad was a deserter.
Apparently the older man tried to make off for the enemy lines.  
BURNS: Sir! Major Barrington, sir.  
SMYTHE: Thanks.  
(The Sergeant Major leaves.)  
BARRINGTON: This is Lady Jennifer Buckingham, sir, and Lieutenant.  
SMYTHE: How do you do. Do sit down.  
BUCKINGHAM: Thank you.  
SMYTHE: Barrington, you know my adjutant, Ransom, don't you?  
BARRINGTON: Yes, we, er, Ransom and I were er  
(Smythe puts on his spectacles.)  
SMYTHE: You were at school together. You were at school together.  
BARRINGTON: Yes, that's right. How are you Ransom?  
SMYTHE: Now, Carstairs, tell me, where did you find these civilians?  
(Later the Kings Regulations and Orders for the Army, 1912 is opened. Ransom,
Smythe and Barrington are at the little table as a Court Martial.)  
BURNS: Left, right, left, right. Escort and accused, mark time. Halt. left
turn.  
DOCTOR: Major Barrington, how nice to see you.  
BURNS: Accused! Back in line.  
SMYTHE: If you are ready, gentlemen? March the prisoners forward, Sergeant
Major.  
BURNS: Sir! Accused, one pace forward, march.  
JAMIE: Now, look, what's going on here?  
SMYTHE: The Court Martial is now in session.  
DOCTOR: Court Martial? But we're civilians.  
SMYTHE: This whole area is under martial law.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, that may be, but if you'll allow me to explain, we were  
SMYTHE: You will have an opportunity of addressing the Court at the proper
time.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.  
SMYTHE: Now, the statements of Lieutenant Carstairs and Lady Jennifer have
been taken into evidence. The prisoners waylaid an ambulance in no man's land  
DOCTOR: Waylaid? The ambulance found us.  
SMYTHE: The vehicle was later commandeered by a waiting enemy patrol.
Recaptured by Lieutenant Carstairs, the prisoners insinuated themselves into a
forward command post, where at the earliest opportunity one of them made a
break for the enemy lines with whatever information he had gathered.  
ZOE: Oh, but none of that's true. You've twisted the whole thing.  
DOCTOR: This is a travesty of justice. What are we charged with?  
SMYTHE: In the case of this man, desertion from a Highland regiment.  
JAMIE: But, but  
SMYTHE: In the case of yourself and the girl, the charge is one of espionage.
The penalty for all these charges is death.  
DOCTOR: But this is monstrous!  
SMYTHE: We shall now hear the case for the defence. Have you anything to say?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I most certainly have! Am I allowed to question the witnesses?  
SMYTHE: Certainly. We wish to give you every opportunity to explain
yourselves.  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Lady Jennifer, will you please explain to these gentlemen
the circumstances of our meeting.  
SMYTHE: There's no need for that. It's in the statement. Next question.  
DOCTOR: What? Well, Lieutenant Carstairs, when your men recaptured the
ambulance, wasn't it obvious to you we were prisoners of the Germans?  
SMYTHE: Has the defence finished with this witness?  
DOCTOR: Well, if you're not going to allow them to answer, what is the use?  
SMYTHE: Very well. Have you any explanation to offer before the Court passes
sentence?  
ZOE: But you haven't heard anything yet. You don't really call this a trial,
do you?  
SMYTHE: The Court will now consider it's verdict.  
JAMIE: Hey, you haven't even asked me anything.  
SMYTHE: There's nothing to ask you. You are a deserter! March him away,
Sergeant Major!  
BURNS: Sir. Escort and accused, left turn. Left wheel, by the front, quick
march! Left, right, left, right. Halt!  
JAMIE: I thought you were going to explain everything?  
DOCTOR: Well, he didn't give me a chance, did he. There's something very
strangely wrong here.  
ZOE: Why has that General got it in for us? He seems determined to find us
guilty.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but why?  
RANSOM: I don't know. They seem pretty harmless to me.  
BARRINGTON: Yes, there's no actual evidence of them actually spying on
anything.  
(Smythe puts on his spectacles.)  
SMYTHE: It is quite clear that they are all guilty. All guilty!  
BARRINGTON: Yes, they're guilty. Knew it as soon as I looked at them.  
RANSOM: There's clear evidence that they were spying.  
SMYTHE: Thank you, gentlemen. Well, I think we can resume. Sergeant Major,
bring the prisoners back.  
BURNS: Escort and accused, left wheel! By the front, quick march. Left, right,
left, right, left wheel. Mark time. Halt! Right turn!  
SMYTHE: The Court has carefully considered all of the evidence and finds you
all guilty as charged. Desertion in a time of war is a most heinous military
crime.  
JAMIE: Look, I've deserted from nowhere! I was never in your rotten army.  
SMYTHE: You will be confined to a military barracks awaiting a regimental
Court Martial.  
JAMIE: Now look, I'm not being confined anywhere.  
SMYTHE: You, young lady, have betrayed your King and country. You are
sentenced to ten years penal servitude to be spent in a civilian prison.  
ZOE: Oh but I haven't done anything!  
SMYTHE: The court finds you guilty of espionage. For a crime of this magnitude
there is only one penalty.  
DOCTOR: But this is ridiculous! You know all the evidence has been twisted
against us! Tell them!  
SMYTHE: The witnesses have given their evidence. The court has reached it's
verdict. If you've nothing further to say, sentence will be passed.  
DOCTOR: I most certainly have something further to say! This is all just a
mockery! I demand the right to appeal to a higher authority.  
SMYTHE: There is no right of appeal. You will be executed at dawn tomorrow.
Take him away, Sergeant Major!  
BURNS: Prisoners and escort, left turn!  
JAMIE: Now just a moment, you can't do this to us!  
BURNS: Hold him!  
JAMIE: Let go!  
SERGEANT MAJOR: Hand him over to the MPs. They'll take him to the military
prison.  
(Jamie is taken away.)  
BURNS: I'll take these two back to the cell, sir.  
BUCKINGHAM: Just a minute, Sergeant Major. Captain Ransom, surely you're not
going to keep this poor girl in the cells all night?  
RANSOM: Well, we've nowhere else to keep her.  
BUCKINGHAM: Well, why not leave her here? I could look after her.  
RANSOM: Yes, I don't see why not.  
BUCKINGHAM: Thank you.  
RANSOM: All right, put a guard on the door, Sergeant Major, and take him away.  
BURNS: Sir!  
ZOE: Oh I don't want to leave you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Now you stay here, Zoe. Goodbye, my dear.  
(The Doctor kisses Zoe on the forehead and leaves with the Sergeant Major.)  
ZOE: Oh, can't you help us, Lieutenant Carstairs?  
CARSTAIRS: Nothing I can do, I'm afraid.  
BARRINGTON: Well, nice to have met you both. Must be getting back. Goodbye, my
dear. Chin up.  
(Barrington leaves.)  
ZOE: But you can't let them execute the Doctor. He hasn't done anything.  
RANSOM: Well, you heard the evidence, my dear. It's all proved. I'm afraid he
is a spy.

**[Wine cellar]**

BURNS [OC]: Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.  
(The Doctor is marched in.)  
BURNS: I'll see that they bring you something to eat.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Sergeant Major? Have you been at the front long?  
BURNS: Oh, quite a while. I've been out here since  
DOCTOR: What's the matter?  
BURNS: Can't remember. Here, what are you asking me all these questions for?

**[Smythe's room]**

RANSOM: Sir?  
SMYTHE: Yes, what is it?  
RANSOM: You wanted the keys to the prison cell.  
SMYTHE: Oh yes. Is everything arranged for the execution?  
RANSOM: Yes.  
SMYTHE: Very well.  
(Ransom leaves. Smythe puts the keys under his pillow and lies down. A sentry
checks on Zoe and Buckingham sleeping in chairs in the main room. Once he has
gone, Zoe sneaks over to Smythe's room and goes inside. There is no one there.
She discovers the monitor behind the portrait, then hunts for the keys, finds
them and leaves.)

**[Wine cellar]**

(The Doctor hides behind the door when he hears it being unlocked.)  
DOCTOR: Zoe!  
ZOE: Oh Doctor!  
DOCTOR: How on Earth?  
ZOE: Well, I couldn't leave you to be shot, could I? It's dawn.  
DOCTOR: Oh, what a nice and clever girl you are. Now, we must find Jamie. They
said something about a military prison.  
ZOE: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Come on.  
RANSOM: Quite right, Doctor. It is time to go.

**[Farm yard]**

(The firing squad is all ready and waiting. A soldier holds Zoe by the arm as
the Doctor is lead to a stake in front of wall and fastened to it.)  
RANSOM: Squad, attention! Present! Aim!  
(A volley of gunfire.)

__**Episode Two**__

**[Farm yard]**

(Gunshot. The Doctor tenses up for the pain but it is a soldier who has been
injured. There is a sniper in one of the barns nearby.)  
RANSOM: Divert!  
(The firing squad scatter to try and get the sniper. The soldier guarding Zoe
is hit and she runs to free the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: Well done, Zoe. Can you undo it?  
ZOE: Oh, Doctor.  
(Zoe unties him.)  
ZOE: Come on!

**[Smythe's room]**

(Smythe is reporting to his controllers.)  
SMYTHE: I am leaving for the conference now.  
(Smythe turns off the monitor and closes the portrait over it. There is a
Tardis-like sound as a large metal object appears in the corner of the room
and an entrance slides forward from the centre. Ransom enters.)  
RANSOM: General Smythe, the prisoners have  
SMYTHE: Ransom, get out!  
RANSOM: Sir, what?  
(Smythe puts on his spectacles.)  
SMYTHE: There is nothing there. You can see nothing.  
RANSOM: No, sir, there's nothing there.  
SMYTHE: You have not seen me. I have been called away to an important meeting.  
RANSOM: Important meeting. Yes.  
(Smythe goes into the SIDRAT, for that is what it is, the door closes and it
dematerialises.)  
RANSOM: General Smythe? Oh, of course, he's gone to that meeting.

**[Tack room]**

(Still not a proper cell, but with barbed wire wrapped around the bars in the
door grille.)  
JAMIE: Hey, do I not get any breakfast?  
(Two guards throw another man in with Jamie. Dishevelled but still wearing his
powdered wig...)  
JAMIE: Redcoat? What are you doing here?  
REDCOAT: Highlander! Keep away from me, you!  
JAMIE: Hey, easy now. I'm a prisoner too, you know! How'd you get here? Well,
come on, how did you get here?  
REDCOAT: I don't know, I can't remember! I got lost, I think.  
JAMIE: What year do you think it is?  
REDCOAT: Year? Why, it's seventeen forty five.  
JAMIE: Sss?!

**[Forest edge]**

(The Doctor uses his telescope to spy out a set of heavily guarded farm
buildings complete with machine gun emplacements.)  
DOCTOR: Oh yes. Yes. Yes, that's it. That's the military prison, all right.
That's where Jamie'll be. Take a look. The trouble is those sentries.  
ZOE: What are we going to do?  
DOCTOR: Don't know. I shall have to think of something. Come on.  
(They run down a slope to a road where a staff car is driving along. The
Doctor flags it down.)  
DOCTOR: Stop! And about time too! Where have you been?  
DRIVER: Eh?  
DOCTOR: You were sent to meet us!  
DRIVER: Meet who?  
DOCTOR: Now don't argue! Take us to the prison! In you get, Miss Heriot. Well,
drive on!

**[Tack room]**

JAMIE: Look, you must try and remember!  
REDCOAT: I've told you. I was fighting up in the Highlands, I got lost and I
don't. There was this mist.  
JAMIE: Uh huh.  
REDCOAT: It came down all round me. The next thing I knew, everything was
different.  
JAMIE: Well, how do you mean, different?  
REDCOAT: Well, there were these great big guns, bigger than I'd ever seen
before, and carts moving along without horses.  
JAMIE: Aye, I've seen those too. Now, go on, go on.  
REDCOAT: Well, then these fellows in the funny uniforms, they came along, and
they caught me and brought me here. Where are we?  
JAMIE: I don't know. But I've got to get to the Doctor. Look, and you're going
to help me.  
REDCOAT: Oh, no! I don't trust you. You're one of them rebels!  
JAMIE: Now look, just you listen to me a moment.  
(Jamie advances on the Redcoat with a wheel spoke in his hand.)

**[Commandant's office]**

(Farmhouse kitchen, actually. Another officer on another field telephone.)  
GORTON: Who? Civilians? Well, tell them to wait. I'm having my tea.  
(But barely has he taken a sip when -)  
DOCTOR: How dare you treat me like this, sir!  
GORTON: What? Who the blazes are you?  
DOCTOR: Don't you address me like that, sir! This is disgraceful! I shall make
a complaint directly to the Minister himself!  
(That would be Lord Derby.)  
GORTON: Minister? Oh, I don't understand. Who are you?  
DOCTOR: I'm the examiner from the War Office, I'm here to inspect the military
prison. This young lady is my secretary. Well, you were expecting us, surely?  
GORTON: Well, there must be some mistake. I mean, can I see your
identification papers?  
DOCTOR: How dare you! You send no car to meet us on our arrival, and now you
add insult to injury by doubting my credentials! Do you know who I am, sir?  
GORTON: Well, I'm terribly sorry and all that. It's probably my adjutant's
fault. Would you care for some tea?  
DOCTOR: We are here to inspect the security arrangements of the prison. Now I
suggest we stop wasting time and get on with it!

**[British command post]**

RANSOM: Not a trace of them. General Smythe'll be furious. We must get those
people back.  
CARSTAIRS: Yes, of course, sir.  
RANSOM: Now, you're got to help me, both of you. Get a party from my sergeant
and search this building.  
CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir.  
RANSOM: I'll take a patrol towards the German lines.  
BUCKINGHAM: What shall I do?  
RANSOM: I'd like you to stay here and man the telephone. I've put out an alert
and someone might phone in some information. All right, Carstairs?  
CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir!  
RANSOM: Lady Jennifer, if the General returns perhaps you'd explain what has
happened?  
BUCKINGHAM: Certainly. Where's he gone?  
RANSOM: He's been called away to an urgent meeting.  
(Ransom leaves.)  
BUCKINGHAM: I know it's an awful thing to say but I can't help hoping they get
away.  
CARSTAIRS: I know just how you feel. Still  
RANSOM [OC]: Carstairs!  
CARSTAIRS: Excuse me.

**[Tack room]**

(The Redcoat has Jamie on the floor, struggling.)  
JAMIE: Help me, guard! He's trying to  
REDCOAT: You're right, I'll kill you!  
JAMIE: He's trying to kill me! Stop it!  
(Two guards rush in and haul the Redcoat off Jamie.)  
GUARD: Get off him!  
JAMIE: Now!  
(Jamie rams the wheel spoke into the sergeant's belly then punches his lights
out while the Redcoat first knees then hits the other.)  
JAMIE: You fight very well, for a redcoat.

**[British command post]**

BUCKINGHAM: All right, Corporal. I'll tell the Captain.  
(Carstairs enters.)  
BUCKINGHAM: Any luck?  
CARSTAIRS: Not a sign.  
BUCKINGHAM: That was one of the patrol posts. Nothing to report.  
CARSTAIRS: Poor old Ransom. He's in for a sticky time when the General gets
back.  
BUCKINGHAM: Didn't you think that there was something rather strange about
that court martial?  
CARSTAIRS: Oh well, military justice, you know. It's not like the Old Bailey.  
BUCKINGHAM: No, but, you remember we were talking about not remembering
things?  
CARSTAIRS: Yes?  
BUCKINGHAM: Well, things are starting to come back to me.  
CARSTAIRS: What sort of things?  
BUCKINGHAM: Well, I was on my way to the hospital, well behind the lines. I
was driving through a forest and all of a sudden there was a strange sort of
mist. Fog. And then I was in a field dressing station looking after some
wounded soldiers.  
CARSTAIRS: Hmm. Loss of memory.  
BUCKINGHAM: No, but isn't it strange that you should to be suffering from it
too?  
CARSTAIRS: Mist!  
BUCKINGHAM: What about it?  
CARSTAIRS: I wonder, could it be some kind of new gas? If perhaps the Germans
have invented a new type of poison gas, one that affects our minds.

**[Commandant's office]**

GORTON: And finally, on the outer perimeter there are the concealed tripwires
and the patrols.  
DOCTOR: Ah.  
ZOE: Certainly does look escape proof.  
DOCTOR: I'd like to see your records.  
GORTON: What? Oh yes, they're over here. You won't find anything wrong there.  
(Gorton hands over a huge ledger.)  
DOCTOR: I sincerely hope not.  
GORTON: There you are.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes.  
GORTON: Arrivals.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
GORTON: Lengths of sentences. Discharges.  
DOCTOR: Yes, arrivals. Latest arrival, Scottish deserter awaiting return to
his regiment. Possible to talk to a prisoner?  
GORTON: Well, er, it's very irregular. However, for you I'm sure that I can
arrange (The telephone rings.)  
GORTON: Excuse me. Gorton here. What? Escaped! Well, get onto it right away,
man. Let me know as soon as you've got them.  
DOCTOR: Is something the matter, Commandant?  
GORTON: Er, nothing important.  
DOCTOR: Did I hear you say that someone had escaped?  
GORTON: Oh well, as a matter of fact, yes. Two chaps. One of them was the
Scotsman that you were talking about.

**[Prison]**

(Jamie and the Redcoat skirt along a wall, but when they have to step out into
the open they are spotted.)  
GUARD: Halt or we fire!  
JAMIE: Come on!  
(The guards fire their revolvers.)

**[Commandant's office]**

GORTON: Shot? Both of them? I see, right. Keep me informed. That's one of
them. Shot while trying to escape.  
ZOE: Shot? Well, which one was it? The Highlander?  
GORTON: No, but does it matter?  
DOCTOR: Matter? Why, of course it matters! Shooting down prisoners? Why, it's
barbaric!  
GORTON: But they were trying to escape!  
DOCTOR: Well, that's no excuse for murder! I want the other man brought here.  
GORTON: What for?  
DOCTOR: I'm not satisfied. I want to hear the prisoner's side of the story.  
(Jamie is dragged along by two guards, his feet not touching the ground, and
pushed into the kitchen.)  
JAMIE: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: We'll see you get a doctor if you need one, my man. Right, let him go.
Commandant, dismiss your man.  
GORTON: Carry on.  
(The MP leaves.)  
JAMIE: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Speak when you're spoken to! Now then, what's all this about trying to
escape?  
JAMIE: What are you up to?  
DOCTOR: I'm not concerned with that! What about the other man you escaped
with?  
JAMIE: Oh, he was shot in the leg, and they were going to shoot me, too.  
DOCTOR: I see. This is very serious. I shall have to make a full report.  
GORTON: But they were trying to escape! My men had no alternative but to
shoot.  
DOCTOR: We'll see what General Smythe has to say about that  
. GORTON: Indeed we will!  
DOCTOR: What are you doing?  
GORTON: I'm going to telephone General Smythe. I've had about all I can take
from you, sir. General Smythe.  
DOCTOR: Ah, you'll regret this. The Minister  
GORTON: I don't care two hoots about the Minister. Besides, I'm not even sure
you're from the War Office. Yes, where are your identity papers?  
DOCTOR: My identity papers?  
GORTON: I thought so. I thought there was a fishy story all along. Hello, is
that  
(Zoe smashes a vase of flowers down onto Gorton's head.)  
ZOE: I'm sorry, Doctor, but it seemed the only way.  
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Zoe. Yes, I think he'll survive. Right, come on. Let's
see if we can bluff our way out of here.  
JAMIE: Yeah, but why were you kidding  
(Ransom enters with two MPs.)  
RANSOM: Going somewhere? Perhaps I can give you a lift?

**[British command post]**

BUCKINGHAM: General Smythe had made up his mind those people were guilty. He
wanted that man to be shot!  
CARSTAIRS: Perhaps he knew they were guilty?  
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, you don't really believe that?  
CARSTAIRS: No, I don't, but  
(Ransom enters.)  
RANSOM: Well, we've got them. You'll never believe where we found them.  
CARSTAIRS: Where were they?  
RANSOM: Well, I was on my way back here, I'd given up the search. It suddenly
occurred to me I ought to go and tell Gorton about it.  
BUCKINGHAM: Well, who's Gorton?  
RANSOM: He's the Commandant at the prison. Popped into his office and there
they were.  
CARSTAIRS: What were they doing there?  
RANSOM: Do you know, that chap, he'd convinced old Gorton that he was a
minister from Whitehall. And he'd nearly bluffed him into letting that Scots
lad go. I don't know I must say I admire his gall. It seems a pity, really, to
have to shoot him.  
CARSTAIRS: Sir, I'd like to speak to you, sir. The court martial wasn't in
accordance with King's Regulations.  
RANSOM: What?  
CARSTAIRS: I'm not satisfied.  
RANSOM: Oh don't be ridiculous, man, it's perfectly fair. General's a great
stickler for that kind of thing. Sentence will be carried out as soon as he
returns. Lady Jennifer, notify Command Post, will you? Let them know the
hunt's over.  
BUCKINGHAM: Yes, certainly.  
(Ransom leaves.)  
BUCKINGHAM: Do you see? He didn't remember what happened at the court martial.  
CARSTAIRS: He really seems to believe they had a fair trial!  
BUCKINGHAM: The General wanted that man to be shot. Why?  
CARSTAIRS: I don't know. I think I'd better have a word with those civilians
and try and find out. If Ransom comes back, keep him occupied, will you?  
BUCKINGHAM: Right.

**[Wine cellar]**

DOCTOR: A redcoat, Jamie?  
JAMIE: Aye, and he thinks he's in 1745.  
DOCTOR: But that's a complete anachronism.  
JAMIE: Aye. It's a what?  
DOCTOR: It's something out of it's own time.  
ZOE: Yes, like the telecommunications unit in the General's room that I told
you about.  
JAMIE: Eh?  
ZOE: I found it when I was looking for the key.  
DOCTOR: Both these things are in the wrong time. But what are they doing here
in 1917?  
JAMIE: Shush.  
(Carstairs enters, revolver drawn.)  
CARSTAIRS: Close the door.

**[British command post]**

BUCKINGHAM: Yes Major, they were recaptured half an hour ago. Captain Ransom
wanted me to let you know. Goodbye. I've notified all the command posts.  
RANSOM: That's awfully kind of you. Has the General not returned yet?  
BUCKINGHAM: No. Does he often disappear like this? I mean, surely he ought to
keep you informed?  
RANSOM: Well, he's a very busy man, you know. Where's young Carstairs?  
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, he's gone to look for some transport.  
RANSOM: Oh, good. I think I'd better go and make certain those prisoners are
safely under lock and key.  
BUCKINGHAM: It must be very difficult working for someone like General Smythe.  
RANSOM: Yes, I suppose he is a bit of a martinet. He has a great deal of
responsibility, you know.  
BUCKINGHAM: Oh yes, but a great deal falls upon your shoulders, Captain.  
RANSOM: Yes, I suppose it is a job, running a place like this you know. Quite
a problem. People don't understand. It's the paperwork, you see. It's quite
fantastic how many forms we have to fill in. Just look at that.

**[Wine cellar]**

CARSTAIRS: What is a video screen? Some kind of kinematograph?  
ZOE: Oh, well, it's a bit more complicated than that. If only I could show it
to you.  
DOCTOR: If you'll take us to the General's room, we'll prove this thing
exists!  
CARSTAIRS: All right, you show it to me and I'll believe you. But you'd better
be right.

**[British command post]**

BUCKINGHAM: I see! But how do you keep a track of all the equipment?  
RANSOM: Ah well, now that's the problem. I keep sending these subalterns the
forms, and they just don't fill them in.  
BUCKINGHAM: But if they're at the front, fighting?  
RANSOM: There's no excuse for mislaying valuable military equipment. Do you
know, in the last push we lost over one hundred shovels?  
(The telephone rings. Buckingham gets to it first.)

**[Outside the wine cellar]**

CARSTAIRS: Hello, Lady Jennifer? Carstairs. Look, I. What, there with you now?
Well, get rid of him, quickly!

**[British command post]**

BUCKINGHAM: Yes, all right. I will.  
RANSOM: That for me?  
BUCKINGHAM: Yes, all right.  
RANSOM: Who was there?  
BUCKINGHAM: The General.  
RANSOM: The General?  
BUCKINGHAM: He's at number seventeen command post and he'd like you to join
him there immediately.  
RANSOM: Oh, right. Well, what's he doing there? That's the farthest point of
the sector! I'd better join him, I suppose. Jolly nice talking to you. You
know, not many women take an interest in the problems of supply. Goodbye.  
(Ransom leaves. The telephone rings.)  
BUCKINGHAM: Yes? Yes, he's just gone. Oh. All right.  
(Buckingham goes to the window to watch a car drive away. Carstairs enters
with the Doctor, Zoe and Jamie.)  
BUCKINGHAM: What on earth are you doing?  
DOCTOR: There's no time to explain now. Now, where is this thing, Zoe?  
ZOE: It's over there.  
BUCKINGHAM: But that's the General's private room!

**[Smythe's room]**

(Revolver still drawn, Carstairs leads the group in. Zoe opens the portrait
door to reveal the monitor.)  
ZOE: There it is!  
CARSTAIRS: There's nothing there, only wall.  
DOCTOR: What? You mean you can't see that screen?  
BUCKINGHAM: What are we supposed to be looking at?  
CARSTAIRS: Well, I still can't see anything.  
DOCTOR: Look at the wall! Concentrate!  
(Carstairs and Buckingham stare at the wood panelling until the dial and
monitor appear.)  
BUCKINGHAM: It is there. I can see it!  
DOCTOR: Can you see it yet?  
CARSTAIRS: Yes. But what's it for?  
ZOE: Well, it's like a telephone, only you can see people as well as hear
them.  
BUCKINGHAM: What's on the other end?

**[War room]**

DOCTOR [on monitor]: Good heavens, this thing is switched on!  
(The Doctor turns it off, leaving Smythe and a man in a dark visor staring at
a glass map.)

**[Smythe's room]**

ZOE: But we didn't see anything on the screen.  
DOCTOR: No, but somebody may have seen us. We've got to get away from here,
all of us.  
CARSTAIRS: Get away? Where do you hope to get to?  
DOCTOR: Well, anywhere so long as it's away from here.  
CARSTAIRS: I just can't let you go, just like that.  
DOCTOR: Yes, you can. And you've got to come too. Your lives will be in danger
now, both of you.  
BUCKINGHAM: I think he's right.  
DOCTOR: Now look, my friends and I are leaving here. Are you going to shoot us
down?  
CARSTAIRS: All right. I'll believe you.

**[British command post]**

BUCKINGHAM: I'll get the ambulance.  
CARSTAIRS: Yes. I'll meet you by the front entrance.  
DOCTOR: So what do you want us to do?  
CARSTAIRS: Just clamber into the ambulance and keep quiet. I'm going to have
to bluff our way past the sentries. Now, just wait here. I'll get some maps.  
(Carstairs leaves.)  
JAMIE: Are we going back to the Tardis now?  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, we must stay here and see what is happening.  
ZOE: We can't leave these people now, anyway.  
JAMIE: No, I suppose not.  
CARSTAIRS: Right, are you ready? Come on.  
RANSOM: Carstairs, what's going on?  
CARSTAIRS: Orders from the General, sir. He wants the prisoners taken to HQ
immediately.  
RANSOM: Are you sure your message is genuine?  
CARSTAIRS: Well, yes, sir, I spoke to the General personally.  
RANSOM: Well, I don't know. I had a message to meet him at command post
seventeen. That was a fake.  
CARSTAIRS: Well, the General was most insistent, sir, but of course it is up
to you, sir.  
RANSOM: Oh, you'd better carry on.  
CARSTAIRS: Very good, sir. All right, move off. Any trouble mind, I won't
hesitate to fire.  
RANSOM: Just a minute, Carstairs.  
CARSTAIRS: Sir?  
RANSOM: Where's Lady Jennifer?  
CARSTAIRS: She's somewhere around, sir.  
RANSOM: Right.  
(Carstairs and the travellers leave.)  
RANSOM: I want a word with her.

**[Farm gate]**

(The ambulance stops.)  
DOCTOR: Right, Zoe, up you go.  
JAMIE: Okay, right.

**[British command post]**

(The SIDRAT has materialised in Smythe's room and the General has closed the
portrait door properly.)  
SMYTHE: Where are the prisoners?  
RANSOM: Everything's all right, sir. They're on their way to headquarters just
as you ordered.  
SMYTHE: I gave no such order!  
RANSOM: Well, they've just left with Lieutenant Carstairs, sir.  
SMYTHE: Ransom, you're a fool! Where's Lady Jennifer?  
RANSOM: I don't know, sir. She gave me a message to meet you at command post
seventeen. (looks out of the window) The ambulance, sir, it's gone.  
SMYTHE: Now we know what to look for. Well, issue a general order at once!  
RANSOM: Yes, sir.  
(Whilst the ambulance trundles along a road.)  
RANSOM: Good, thank you. Ambulance spotted, sir.  
SMYTHE: Where?  
RANSOM: Sector four, heading east, travelling very fast. I'll send out a
motorcycle patrol.  
SMYTHE: No need for that.  
RANSOM: Well, sector four could cut them off.  
SMYTHE: Concentration of artillery there. Yes, that should reach them.  
RANSOM: We'll use artillery on an ambulance, sir?  
SMYTHE: That ambulance is in enemy hands, Ransom.  
RANSOM: But there are two women on board.  
(Smythe puts his spectacles on.)  
SMYTHE: I want a creeping barrage laid along that road. Do you understand? Do
you understand?  
RANSOM: Yes, I understand.  
SMYTHE: Good. Well, order the artillery to fire, then.  
RANSOM: A very good idea, sir. Creeping barrage. Stop them dead.  
SMYTHE: That's just how we want them. Dead.

**[Ambulance]**

(The shell explosions make the ambulance stop. Carstairs joins the Doctor,
Jamie and Zoe in the back.)  
CARSTAIRS: Maps! Artillery barrage, and we're still seven miles from the
German line.  
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps it's not, perhaps it's not German artillery.  
CARSTAIRS: Well, our chaps wouldn't fire at us.  
DOCTOR: No, but General Smythe might!  
JAMIE: Whoever it is, his aim's getting better!  
CARSTAIRS: Let's get out of here! Bring the rest of the maps.  
DOCTOR: Righto! Stay here, keep under cover.

**[Road]**

(The Doctor sits with Buckingham and Carstairs up front.)  
CARSTAIRS: Right!  
(The ambulance drives forward and fades to nothing.)

**[Mist]**

BUCKINGHAM: Oh!  
DOCTOR: What is it?  
CARSTAIRS: Fog. Can't see.  
BUCKINGHAM: The mist, the gas!  
DOCTOR: Gas?  
BUCKINGHAM: I can't go on, there's something stopping me.  
DOCTOR: It's not gas, go on.  
BUCKINGHAM: I can't!  
DOCTOR: Well, move over. Let me, come on.  
(The Doctor gets behind the steering wheel and releases the handbrake.)

**[Road]**

(The ambulance appears on a peaceful road winding besides a river - actually
Seven Sisters Country Park, Sussex. They get out and look around.)  
JAMIE: That's more like it.  
ZOE: That mist, Doctor, what was it?  
DOCTOR: I don't know, Zoe. Some sort of force field.  
ZOE: Where are we? There's no sign of the war here.  
JAMIE: Yes, and the guns have stopped, too.  
DOCTOR: Yes. It's odd, Jamie.  
CARSTAIRS: Feeling better?  
BUCKINGHAM: Yes. Thank you.

**[Hilltop]**

(Above the road and river. There's a vague sound of men shouting in the
distance.)  
JAMIE: Ah, that's better!  
ZOE: What's that?  
(A phalanx of warriors are heading towards them lead by a two horse chariot.
Romans!)  
ZOE: Oh, come on!

**[Road]**

(As the Romans plant their SPQR at the top of the rise.)  
DOCTOR: Start the engine!  
ZOE: Quick!  
JAMIE: Look!  
CARSTAIRS: Switch on.  
(Carstairs starts cranking as the Romans bear down on them.)

__**Episode Three**__

**[Road]**

(The ambulance engine catches and Carstairs gets in as Buckingham slowly backs
the ambulance up the road and it fades away. When the Romans get there they
just stop in mid yell.)

**[Ambulance]**

ZOE: That was a close shave. Where are we, Doctor?  
JAMIE: Oh no, we're not back here again.  
(Carstairs and Buckingham join them in the back.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, Lieutenant Carstairs, is this the only map you're supplied with?  
CARSTAIRS: Yes, that's the one.  
DOCTOR: It's a bit inadequate, isn't it?  
BUCKINGHAM: Doctor, who were those people who attacked us just now?  
DOCTOR: Oh, they were Romans.  
CARSTAIRS: Oh, but that's impossible!  
DOCTOR: Oh, lots of impossible things happen when you pass through time.  
BUCKINGHAM: Time? But no one can alter time.  
DOCTOR: Look, it is 1917 where we are now on this map. Where we were attacked
by the Romans it is two thousand years ago.  
CARSTAIRS: But surely, Doctor  
DOCTOR: Surely before we met the Romans we passed through a mist didn't we? A
gas you called it. Now, supposing this mist is a barrier between different
time zones?  
ZOE: I see. So we went off the edge of this map and into a different time
zone.  
DOCTOR: Yes. What we need is a map which covers all the time zones. I'm afraid
we shall have to get back to General Smythe's headquarters, to the chateau.  
JAMIE: Well how are we going to get back there?  
DOCTOR: Well, that's easy. You will take us!

**[British command post]**

RANSOM: No trace of them? Well, keep searching!  
(Jamie and the Doctor enter, followed by Carstairs.)  
CARSTAIRS: Lieutenant Carstairs reporting, sir. I brought back the prisoners.  
RANSOM: Carstairs, what on earth have you been up to? And what do you mean by
giving me that fake report from the General? I warn you, Carstairs, you're in
very serious trouble! You're  
(Carstairs points his revolver directly at Ransom.)  
RANSOM: Have you gone mad?  
CARSTAIRS: I'm sorry about this, sir.  
RANSOM: You'll be shot for this, Carstairs!  
CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir.  
(Jamie takes Ransom's gun.)  
CARSTAIRS: Don't do anything foolish, sir. I think it might be better if you
raised your hands.  
(The Doctor rummages around for maps.)  
CARSTAIRS: Bandages, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: What? Oh, yes. I'm afraid that there's nothing here, only local maps.
Here we are. Perhaps there's something in the General's room. I'll go and see.  
RANSOM: This is mutiny. I hope you  
(Jamie stuffs a handkerchief into Ransom's mouth and fastens it there with a
bandage.)

**[Smythe's room]**

(The Doctor enters and looks around.)  
CARSTAIRS: Find anything?  
DOCTOR: Well, only this safe.  
CARSTAIRS: The only way to get inside that is to blow it up.  
DOCTOR: Oh, what a good idea.  
CARSTAIRS: You serious?  
DOCTOR: Well, this is a military establishment, there must be some explosives
around here.  
CARSTAIRS: Right. I'll see what I can find.  
DOCTOR: Good.  
(Carstairs leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie, I wonder whether perhaps I can pick this lock.  
JAMIE: Aye, with a tuning fork?  
(While Ransom is trussed up on the settee, Carstairs opens boxes and crates in
the drawing room.)  
JAMIE: Oh come on, Doctor, we haven't got all night. Someone's bound to turn
up.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, Jamie. Oh dear, this is useless.  
(Carstairs enters with a hand-sized device.)  
JAMIE: What's that thing?  
CARSTAIRS: It's a Mills bomb. It's all I could find. I thought we might hang
it on the front of the safe and let it off.  
DOCTOR: Oh, well, yes, that might blow the room up very nicely, but I don't
think it would affect the safe much. You see we have to concentrate the  
(The Doctor is fiddling with the primitive grenade.)  
CARSTAIRS: Look out!  
DOCTOR: Whole explosion into the lock there.  
CARSTAIRS: Blow us all up.  
DOCTOR: Now then, if I can pack the explosive into the lock and then detonate
it. Ah, here we are. Now then. Ah yes, I see.  
CARSTAIRS: For goodness sake, be careful. That's Amatol in there.  
DOCTOR: It's all right. I do have the detonator, you know. Now then, just
release this. There we are. Now what have we got? Oh yes.  
(The Doctor pours the explosive powder onto a piece of paper.)  
DOCTOR: This fuse, how long does it last?  
CARSTAIRS: About four seconds.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's not very good, is it?  
(The Doctor looks for a longer fuse, briefly considering on of the tassels on
Jamie's best sporran. He settles for breaking a candle and using its wick. He
inserts it carefully into the safe lock.)  
DOCTOR: There we are.  
RANSOM [OC]: Help! Help!

**[British command post]**

(Ransom has tipped over the settee and dislodged his gag, obviously.)  
RANSOM: Sergeant Major! Help!  
CARSTAIRS: I'm sorry about this, sir. Can't have you making a row.  
CRANE: Hello.  
CARSTAIRS: Dropped my pen.  
CRANE: Ah. Captain Ransom about?  
CARSTAIRS: No, I'm looking after things. Can I help?  
CRANE: Well, it's a bit tricky, actually. The sentry found these two ladies
hiding in an ambulance.  
CARSTAIRS: Well? What about it?  
CRANE: Well, you remember there was this spy flap earlier today. Something
about them getting away in an ambulance and one of them was a woman. I don't
think we've met before, have we?

**[Smythe's room]**

(Jamie strikes a match and they hide behind Smythe's camp bed. The Doctor
covers his head with a pillow.)  
DOCTOR: Now we light the blue touch paper and retire immediately!

**[British command post]**

BUCKINGHAM: This is all completely ridiculous!  
CARSTAIRS: Really, old chap, you can leave them to me. I'm sure we can sort it
out.  
CRANE: But don't you think I ought to wait for Captain Ransom?  
CARSTAIRS: He may be quite some time.  
CRANE: I can wait. How long do you say you've been on attachment here?

**[Smythe's room]**

CRANE [OC]: How long?  
CARSTAIRS [OC]: About three months.  
JAMIE: Someone's out there with Carstairs.  
(They go to listen at the door.)

**[British command post]**

CARSTAIRS: You may leave them to me, old chap. It's quite under control.  
CRANE: Oh well, right you are. Sorry about all this. Do hope you understand.
Can't afford to take chances, you see.  
ZOE: We quite understand.

**[Smythe's room]**

CRANE [OC]: Perhaps you could stay for dinner. We don't often see ladies here.
The chaps in the mess would be delighted.  
BUCKINGHAM [OC]: Sorry, but we really have to be on our way.  
DOCTOR: We shall have to put the fuse out. It's too late! Duck!

**[British command post]**

CRANE: Cheerio!  
(Crane leaves. The safe goes Boom and he rushes back in again.)  
CRANE: What the blazes?

**[Smythe's room]**

(Crane runs in. The Doctor and Jamie are coughing. Crane turns then raises his
arms.)  
CARSTAIRS: Now don't do anything foolish, old boy. Doc, have you got any more
bandages?  
DOCTOR: Ah yes. Here we are, Jamie.  
CRANE: You're Carstairs, the one who went off with the spies!  
CARSTAIRS: Come on!  
(Jamie takes Crane out to be tied up. The Doctor has found a map marked off in
triangles. Zoe enters.)  
DOCTOR: Look, Zoe. 1917 zone, Roman zone, American Civil War zone. This whole
place is divided into time zones.  
ZOE: But there's a blank space in the middle. There's nothing marked at all.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, and I think that that's where we've got to get to.  
(And not the Crimean, 30 Years, Russo-Japanese, Greek, Boer, Peninsular,
English Civil or Mexican Civil war zones.)

**[Road]**

(The ambulance is stopped by a German patrol.)  
DOCTOR: This is an ambulance. We have a seriously wounded officer in the back.  
(A German goes round to see Carstairs having his brow mopped by Zoe, with
Buckingham attending.)  
GERMAN: Sie mÅ©ssen mit uns kommen.  
DOCTOR: Ah. You want me to come with you. Ah well, if you put it like that.
Yes, here we go.

**[German trench]**

ZOE: Well, what's going to happen to us?  
JAMIE: Ah, foreigners! Look, what's the use of pretending that Carstairs is
wounded? They're bound to find out sooner or later.  
ZOE: Well, at least it stopped them taking him to a prison camp. Besides, he's
safe in the ambulance with Jennifer.  
JAMIE: Aye, for how long though?  
ZOE: Well, perhaps the Doctor will be able to talk them into letting us go.  
JAMIE: Aye.

**[German field office]**

LÃCKE: For the last time, what is your name?  
DOCTOR: Why don't you just call me Doctor?  
LÃCKE: That is not a name. I want your full name.  
DOCTOR: Oh, very well. Doctor John Smith.  
LÃCKE: Good. Now we are getting somewhere. What are you doing behind our
lines?  
DOCTOR: Well, we were lost, you see.  
LÃCKE: So, you are lost. And very conveniently you find your way through our
lines.  
DOCTOR: I realise this must seem rather strange.  
LÃCKE: I find it both strange and suspicious.  
DOCTOR: But I can assure you we're quite harmless.  
LÃCKE: Three people dressed in civilian clothes trying to infiltrate through
our lines. Admit it, you are spies.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, we are not spies.  
LÃCKE: Then tell me where you came from before you were picked up by that
ambulance.  
DOCTOR: Well, you see, that's rather difficult to explain.  
LÃCKE: Everything seems to be difficult for you to explain. I advise you to
tell me the truth. Now!  
(Lucke cocks his revolver.)  
DOCTOR: All right, if you insist.

**[German trench]**

(A soldier gives them two Prussian helmets.)  
JAMIE: Oh! I don't know how they stick it out here.  
ZOE: It's the same with the British, remember.  
JAMIE: What a way to fight, though, hiding in wee holes and blasting each
other with big guns.  
(Boom!)  
ZOE: Oh, I wish we could get out of here, Jamie!

**[German field office]**

LÃCKE: Other planets? A time machine? The girl is from the future and the boy
is from the past?  
DOCTOR: Well, you told me to tell you the truth.  
LÃCKE: I think you must be mad.  
DOCTOR: Why don't you ask my companions if you don't believe me?  
LÃCKE: Bringen Sie die anderen EnglÃ¤nder herein! Sofort! We shall soon see if
your stories are the same.  
(Jamie and Zoe enter.)  
LÃCKE: Young woman, where did you meet this man?  
DOCTOR: Tell him the truth, both of you.  
LÃCKE: Silence! Well?  
ZOE: We met at a space station.  
LÃCKE: A space station. And you, where did you meet this man?  
JAMIE: In Scotland.  
LÃCKE: Ach, so. Now tell me, when?  
JAMIE: In seventeen forty five. I was fighting the Redcoats.  
LÃCKE: You were fighting the Redcoats in seventeen forty five? That ambulance,
was it going to a hospital or to a lunatic asylum?  
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Look, look, I can prove to you that we come from another
time. This is a sonic screwdriver. Now, where can I demonstrate? Ah, that
revolver will do. It's all right.  
(Lucke places his weapon on the table and the Doctor unscrews the hand grip
without touching it.)  
DOCTOR: There we are. And back it goes.  
LÃCKE: Phantastisch!  
DOCTOR: Do you believe me now?  
LÃCKE: But it's impossible. You did not touch the screw. It just moved. Is it
possible you are telling the truth?  
(A bald archetype Prussian enters, complete with duelling scar. All he needs
is a monocle.)  
VON WEICH: Leutnant LÃ¼cke!  
LÃCKE: Jawohl, mein herr!  
VON WEICH: Wer sind diese Leute?  
LÃCKE: Wir haben hier  
VON WEICH: Was ist hier los?  
LÃCKE: Wir haben hier drei Englische zivilisten, herr KapitÃ¤n.  
VON WEICH: What are you doing here? Where do you come from?  
DOCTOR: Well  
LÃCKE: Er hat mir gesagt, dass er aus einem anderen Zeitalter kam, in annen
rontschiff namen Tardis.  
VON WEICH: Time travellers?  
DOCTOR: Well, it is a little difficult to understand, but  
VON WEICH: Leutnant LÃ¼cke! Kommen sie bitte mit mir.  
LUCKE: Jawohl, mein Kapitan.

**[Von Weich's room]**

(Von Weich leads LÃ¼cke though a curtain and screws in his monocle.)  
VON WEICH: Es sind Englische spione! Wir mÃ¼ssen sie festhalten! Ich werde mit
dem General darÃ¼ber sprechen.  
LÃCKE: Jawohl herr KapitÃ¤n Von Weich.  
(LÃ¼cke walks slowly back through the curtain.)

**[German field office]**

LÃCKE: You are dangerous English spies.  
DOCTOR: But this is ridiculous.  
LÃCKE: You are spies! And you are going to be shot.

**[Von Weich's room]**

(Behind a portrait hanging on a panelled wall is another monitor screen, just
like Smythes'.)  
VON WEICH: Von Weich, 1917 German front line to central control. We have
captured three people who escaped from the British sector. They claim to be
time travellers.

**[German field office]**

DOCTOR: No, no, no! We are not spies! The sonic screwdriver. We've just shown
you with the gun.  
LÃCKE: Yes. You did something with thee gun.  
JAMIE: Let the Doctor show you again, eh?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. Now, it's very simple. Put the gun on the table. You can
keep your hand on it again if you like! Now, watch.  
(The screw in the grip goes up and down.)  
LÃCKE: Yes! And then you put it back again!  
DOCTOR: That's right.  
LÃCKE: Is it possible?  
DOCTOR: Oh, we've got lots of tricks like that. Let me show you. Catch, Jamie.  
(Jamie catches the gun and points it at Lucke.)  
DOCTOR: Now then, Lieutenant. I'm sorry about this, but perhaps you'd be good
enough to take us back to our ambulance!

**[War room]**

(Large and alien, staffed by people wearing visors and overalls. An alarm
sounds. Smythe is also there. Four guards in wet suits with laser rifles or
similar enter, followed by a man with a square medallion around his neck.
Smythe gestures the other staff to leave.)  
SMYTHE: Did you have a comfortable trip, sir?  
WAR CHIEF: Excellent. The War Lord is pleased with our work. But the rate of
progress must be accelerated.  
SMYTHE: A report from my zone, sir. The prisoners that escaped from the
chateau been recaptured in the German lines. I have advised they be shot
immediately. They gave some ridiculous story about being time travellers.  
WAR CHIEF: Time travellers? And you ordered them to be shot? I want them
brought here for re-interrogation.  
(The alarm sounds again.)  
VON WEICH [on monitor]: Those prisoners, they've escaped. They will probably
go back to your lines.  
SMYTHE: How did that happen?  
VON WEICH [on monitor]: They tricked my human Lieutenant.  
SMYTHE: Oh that is sheer incompetence!  
WAR CHIEF: They also escaped from you, General Smythe. Organise pursuit and
report back here.  
VON WEICH [on monitor]: Sir.  
(Transmission ends.)  
WAR CHIEF: Issue a general alert. But I want these people captured alive.  
SMYTHE: General alert to all time zones. Five escaped prisoners travelling in
a 1917 British Army ambulance clearly marked with a red cross. These prisoners
may be capable of crossing the time zone barriers. Officers are to describe
the ambulance to their human troops as a hostile vehicle which much be
destroyed at all costs!  
WAR CHIEF [OC]: Time travellers? I wonder.  
SMYTHE: The description of the prisoners is as follows.

**[Ambulance]**

(Under the gaze of an American soldier, the ambulance stops and Carstairs goes
to the back.)  
CARSTAIRS: Can I have a look at that map, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Here we are.  
CARSTAIRS: We've just been through another one of those mists and we've gone
off the edge of my map.  
ZOE: Where do you think we are, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I think we're right about there.  
ZOE: America 1862. That was the American Civil War wasn't it? Another war!  
(Gun shots.)  
CARSTAIRS: Get down!

**[Road]**

(The soldier fires, and Carstairs shoots back.)  
CARSTAIRS: Get moving!

**[Ambulance]**

(The Doctor pokes his head out.)  
ZOE: Oh Doctor, be careful!  
DOCTOR: Zoe, we're right. That was an American Civil War soldier.  
JAMIE: You mean we're mixed up in another war now?  
DOCTOR: Yes. But it means we're on the right road, and we're still making for
that blank space in the middle of the map.

**[Road]**

(Further on, a tree falls in front of the ambulance.)  
CARSTAIRS: Jamie!  
(Jamie, the Doctor and Zoe get out of the ambulance. They are about to move
the tree when shots are fired. Carstairs is the only one who actually hits his
targets though. The survivors run away.)  
CARSTAIRS: Get that tree moved!  
DOCTOR: Come on.  
(Carstairs takes out another man creeping up behind the ambulance, and tackles
a fourth hand to hand. Jamie deals with another as the Doctor and Zoe drag the
tree off the road.)  
DOCTOR: Where have you been? We've done it without you.  
(Carstairs hold off some horsemen as the three get back into the ambulance.
Then he has to change pistols as more cavalry arrive.)  
CARSTAIRS: Lady Jennifer! Drive on!  
(Further on, Buckingham pulls the ambulance over in some bushes and cavalry
ride past. She opens the engine cover.)  
DOCTOR: What's wrong?  
BUCKINGHAM: Afraid we've run out of petrol.  
DOCTOR: Oh no!  
BUCKINGHAM: Where's Lieutenant Carstairs?  
JAMIE: He held them off while we got away.  
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, dear.  
ZOE: Oh, well now what do we do?  
DOCTOR: There's only one thing for it. We shall have to go on by foot. Come
along.

**[War room]**

SMYTHE: If my troops make a push here, what resistance can you put up?  
VON WEICH: Along here we shall have pillboxes, machine gun nests, landmines.
You'll have no chance, but it will be an excellent test of the morale of your
humans. Your entire force will be wiped out.  
SMYTHE: Ah, but I will use my reinforcements to turn your flank. There!  
VON WEICH: Then it will not be a fair battle.  
SMYTHE: Perhaps not, but it will be an excellent test of your morale.  
WAR CHIEF: Those specimens we were discussing. An ambush was laid but only one
was captured.  
SMYTHE: Which one?  
WAR CHIEF: A young Lieutenant, one of yours. He could have got away, but he
stayed behind to help the others escape.  
VON WEICH: These humans are very loyal to one another in stress situations.  
WAR CHIEF: One of their finest qualities. He's being brought back here for re-
processing.

**[Barn]**

(Crickets are singing. It must be evening.)  
JAMIE: It's all right. This'll do for the night, eh?  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, Jamie, this looks all right.  
ZOE: I wish we knew where Lieutenant Carstairs was.  
JAMIE: We shouldn't have left him, you know.  
DOCTOR: It was the way he wanted it.  
ZOE: Well, now what do we do? We've lost Lieutenant Carstairs, the ambulance
has broken down and we're miles from the Tardis.  
DOCTOR: We carry on, of course. We've got no alternative.  
JAMIE: Are we still heading for that blank space in that map of yours?  
DOCTOR: Yes. That is where we'll find the answer. Now we'd better get some
rest. We'll have to start early in the morning.  
(A materialisation sound fills the barn.)  
DOCTOR: Quick, hide!  
(A SIDRAT appears and opens, disgorging ten Union soldiers.)  
ZOE: So many of them! That thing must be bigger inside than outside, just like
the Tardis.  
DOCTOR: I must have a look inside.  
JAMIE: Ah, but be careful now, Doctor!  
BUCKINGHAM: What on earth is it?  
ZOE: It's some kind of space time machine, I think.  
BUCKINGHAM: But it just appeared from nowhere!  
(There is gunfire outside.)  
ZOE: Doctor! Doctor!  
JAMIE: Getting closer!  
ZOE: Oh Doctor, come back!  
(Zoe goes into the SIDRAT.)  
JAMIE: Oh now, Zoe, don't! Lady Jennifer!  
(The SIDRAT door closes as Jamie runs to Buckingham at the barn door.)  
JAMIE: Keep away from the door!  
(The SIDRAT dematerialises.)  
JAMIE: Doctor! No, Zoe, no! Oh no.

__**Episode Four**__

**[Barn]**

(Jamie and Buckingham are stranded in the American Civil War zone. A group of
soldiers surround them.)  
THOMSON: And just who might you be?

**[SIDRAT]**

(Very large inside, with transparent room dividers.)  
ZOE: Doctor, look, it is like the Tardis. Bigger inside than out.  
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoe, you're right.  
ZOE: But who else would have space time machines like the Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Well, there is an answer to that, but I hope, I just hope.  
ZOE: What?  
(Zoe takes a pair of plastic visors with + eye holes from a shelf.)  
ZOE: Doctor, what are these?  
DOCTOR: Zoe, come and see.  
(The Doctor has found a battalion of German WW1 soldiers.)  
ZOE: Why are they just standing there like that?  
DOCTOR: They seem to be in some sort of hypnotic trance.  
(There are Romans in another section.)  
ZOE: Romans, like the ones that attacked us. But these soldiers, what are they
here for?  
DOCTOR: They're going to fight, Zoe. That's what soldiers are for.  
ZOE: But they're all from different times.  
(The SIDRAT rematerialises.)  
ZOE: We're landing!  
(The Doctor looks for an empty compartment.)  
DOCTOR: Quick, in here!  
(The Romans march past.)  
ZOE: We could get away.  
DOCTOR: No, we'd only land up right in the middle of another war.  
ZOE: Well, then, what are we going to do?  
DOCTOR: Well this thing must eventually go back to its base. That's where
we've got to get to.  
ZOE: Oh but Doctor surely  
(The SIDRAT door closes and it dematerialises.)  
DOCTOR: It's taking off again. That settles it.

**[Barn]**

THOMSON: Where do you come from? What are you doing here?  
BUCKINGHAM: Well, that's rather difficult to explain actually.  
RILEY: But, you're English.  
JAMIE: I'm not. I'm a Scot.  
RILEY: You're English! Spies for the South!  
JAMIE: Oh, not again! Look, we're not spies. We're nothing to do with your
war.  
BUCKINGHAM: We're neutral.  
THOMSON: In a civil war, ma'am, no one's neutral. Now who to you support the
North, or the Confederates in the South?  
JAMIE: What's he talking about?  
BUCKINGHAM: American Civil War, Jamie, remember?  
JAMIE: Oh aye.  
RILEY: Oh, they're reb spies, sure enough. Tie 'em up.  
BUCKINGHAM: What are you going to do to us?  
THOMSON: Now that's up to the General. But when we leave here, you're coming
with us.  
RILEY: And the General, he doesn't take kindly to spies. He shoots 'em!  
BUCKINGHAM: This is disgraceful. We are neutral civilians.  
RILEY: Okay, over there.  
THOMSON: All right, you guys, ten minutes rest. Not you. Out on sentry duty.  
(No sooner does the soldier step outside than he is shot.)  
THOMSON: Rebs!  
(The Americans are fully occupied.)  
JAMIE: Try and get my knife.  
RILEY: Sarge, there's too many of them!  
THOMSON: Give me your rifle! Okay, make a break for the woods. I'll stay
behind and give you covering fire. Move!  
RILEY: Good luck, Sarge.  
(The soldiers withdraw as Buckingham tries to cut Jamie's bonds. Thomson
leaves last.)  
BUCKINGHAM: They've forgotten all about us.  
JAMIE: Just as well. How're we doing?  
BUCKINGHAM: Oh. No good, Jamie. Too late.  
(The Confederate army have taken the barn.)  
LEROY: Now don't you worry, ma'am. You're safe now. Oh, just like those
Yankees to treat a lady like this.  
BUCKINGHAM: Thank you.  
LEROY: Oh that's my pleasure, ma'am.  
(Leroy unties Buckingham and Jamie.)  
LEROY: Happens all the time, ma'am. Yankees, they take over your house, tie
you up, steal your food Oh, would you excuse me, ma'am?  
(Leroy talks to his commander, who we only see from the back. He is bald and
as soon as he speaks with a bad southern accent we know who it is.)  
LEROY: The Yankees had some civilian prisoners, sir.  
VON WEICH: These people are enemies of the South.  
LEROY: But Captain  
VON WEICH: The boy is a Yankee soldier, the woman is a spy. You tie them up.  
LEROY: Yes, Captain.  
(Von Weich turns and removes his monocle.)

**[War room]**

SCIENTIST: But the difficulties of this form of mental processing are
considerable.  
WAR CHIEF: I'm not interested in excuses. The process should be universally
effective.  
SCIENTIST: We only have a five percent failure rate.  
WAR CHIEF: That five percent is causing us endless trouble.  
SCIENTIST: What harm can they do?  
WAR CHIEF: Sabotage, murder and subversion. Pockets of resistance building up
everywhere.  
SCIENTIST: But five percent? So few of them cause you trouble?  
WAR CHIEF: Their numbers are growing all the time. If ever they band together
in one organised group, they could cause enough trouble to upset the major
plan. The process must be improved.  
SCIENTIST: It already has been. I am hoping to give a first demonstration to
the students very shortly.  
WAR CHIEF: I hope for your own sake the experiment will be successful.  
(An alarm sounds.)  
VON WEICH [on monitor]: Von Weich, American Civil War Zone to Central Control.
Two more of the escapees from the 1917 zone have been recaptured. The woman
and the boy. The older man and the girl are still free. Soldiers are now
hunting them down.  
WAR CHIEF: Excellent. When you have captured the other two, send them all
here.  
VON WEICH [on monitor]: Sir.  
(Transmission ends.)  
WAR CHIEF: They will make excellent specimens for your reprocessing
experiment.

**[SIDRAT]**

ZOE: We're landing again.  
DOCTOR: Yes, all the soldiers have been delivered, so this must be its base.  
ZOE: Oh Doctor, how do we get back to Jennifer and Jamie? It's working on
remote control.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, there are some controls here. I daresay I could get the
hang of them.

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

(A man is placing various shapes on a large board in front of him. The SIDRAT
materialises in a cubicle behind him, opens its door, and the Doctor and Zoe
peek out.)  
DOCTOR: He must be the person who's controlling this thing.  
ZOE: Shush.  
(An 1800s soldier marches past wearing a visor with three vertical slits for
eyeholes.)  
ZOE: These glasses. They're both wearing them.  
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right. We'd better put them on.  
(They put on the + visors.)  
DOCTOR: Well, come on, let's explore.

**[Barn]**

(Jamie and Lady Jennifer are tied up, and their guards are playing cards. A
cock crows.)  
JAMIE: How long are we going to be kept here?  
JAMIE: Hey, you with the blond hair. I'm talking to you!  
LEROY: You're staying here until the Captain finds those friends of yours. And
then we're going to shoot all four of you together. Yankee spies.  
BUCKINGHAM: But we're not Yankees, we were their prisoners. Don't you
remember?  
JAMIE: Aye, you found us. Look, you were going to let us go.  
LEROY: Me let you go? You must be crazy! You're dangerous Yankee spies.  
(Leroy goes back to his game of not fizzbin.)  
BUCKINGHAM: It's no good, Jamie, you can't possibly get it undone. It  
(Someone puts a hand over her mouth. It is a negro soldier, so not a
Confederate one.)  
HARPER: Not a sound, Mister. Not one sound.  
(Harper unties them.)  
HARPER: There's a hole in the planks over there. Get a move on.  
(Buckingham, Jamie and Harper sneak past LeRoy and his companion.)  
LEROY: Hey, how about that? I'll get some water.  
(Leroy spots the escapees.)  
LEROY: Hey, look!  
HARPER: Run for it!  
JAMIE: Come on!  
HARPER: No, run on! I'll hold them off.  
JAMIE: Where to?  
HARPER: Trail, due north. Old camp.  
JAMIE: Right.  
(Jamie and Buckingham get away. Harper is captured.)  
VON WEICH: What happened?  
LEROY: They got away, he turned them loose. They can't have got far.  
VON WEICH: Get a cavalry patrol, get after them. Hunt them down. So you turned
them loose? Now where're they making for, boy?  
HARPER: Look, I ain't going to tell you nothing.  
(Von Weich fixes his monocle in place.)  
VON WEICH: You're going to tell me where they're making for.  
HARPER: Sorry, Captain, but that stuff doesn't work on me.  
VON WEICH: You're from the Resistance.  
HARPER: That's right, and I'm not one of you. Listen, you all. You're not
fighting the war between the States, you know. He's just using you!  
VON WEICH: It's no use. You'll never get them to understand. They're under my
control.

**[Countryside]**

(Jamie runs down a slope.)  
JAMIE: Lady Jennifer? Lady Jennifer?  
(A cavalry man charges at Jamie, swinging his sword. Jamie dodges, and picks
up a stout tree branch. As the man comes back for another go, Jamie unhorses
him, takes his mount and gallops away.)  
JAMIE: Come on. Yah! Yah!  
(The soldier shoots and misses.)

**[Central area]**

(The Doctor and Zoe are exploring. The doorways are keyhole shaped.)  
ZOE: We've passed a reception area, living quarters, lecture rooms. It's just
like a university.  
DOCTOR: Yes, a sort of training school, but for what?  
ZOE: Shush.  
(Three soldiers from different eras walk past.)  
ZOE: Why didn't they take any notice of us? Because of the glasses?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. Come on, let's see what else we can find.  
GUARD: You two, in!  
DOCTOR: Well we were just  
GUARD: In here! You're late.  
DOCTOR: Oh, well if you insist.  
GUARD: The lecture's already started.  
DOCTOR: Lecture?

**[Lecture hall]**

SCIENTIST: Should you arrive on another planet, you may not be aware that the
problem is to retain the specimen's personality as a fighting man while at the
same time putting him under our control. As you know, we remove the human
specimens from their own world and time, and place them in a context which
seems to them to be the same. It is vital that they continue to believe that
they are living their own lives on the planet Earth and fighting the wars from
which they were taken.  
ZOE [sotto) : So this isn't Earth.  
DOCTOR: Quite right, Zoe, quite right.  
SCIENTIST: With the majority of human specimens, the process used is both
lasting and effective. However, in the case of certain humans of particularly
strong character and individuality, the effects of the process have not been
permanent. Gradually the processing tended to fade and the specimens developed
the ability to pass through the Time Zone Barriers. Some formed themselves
into resistance groups which have considerably hampered the progress of our
plan. It is to overcome this problem that I have further refined our
processing technique. To demonstrate the process I chosen a particularly
difficult specimen. A man who finally shook off the effects of the process
completely, and allied himself to resistance elements in order to fight us.  
(Guards bring out a gurney on which Carstairs is strapped.)  
SCIENTIST: This Lieutenant Carstairs is a 1917 British army officer, who for
some time after his initial processing, believed himself to be fighting for
his country. However as I shall now demonstrate, the process has completely
lapsed and he is now fully conscious of his surroundings. Where are you?  
CARSTAIRS: I don't know.  
SCIENTIST: Describe what you can see.  
CARSTAIRS: A room. Filled with a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo. Funny people,
strange clothes and those sort of glasses that you're wearing.  
(The Doctor gestures Carstairs to keep quiet.)  
SCIENTIST: As you see, he is fully aware of his surroundings and very hostile.
After my new technique has been applied, he will not only be completely
docile, but will be fully convinced that whatever I tell him will be the
truth.  
(The Scientist clamps Carstair's in a metal vice-like device and turns it on.)  
ZOE: Oh, can't we help him?  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, not yet. Later.  
SCIENTIST: This machine is, of course, only a prototype. In due course, other
machines will be built to this pattern, capable of processing large groups of
specimens simultaneously.  
(The machine finishes its cycle.)  
SCIENTIST: Release him.  
(The guards unstrap Carstairs, who stands up.)  
SCIENTIST: What is your name?  
CARSTAIRS: Carstairs.  
SCIENTIST: I am your superior officer, you know.  
CARSTAIRS: Sorry, sir.  
SCIENTIST: Where are you, Carstairs?  
CARSTAIRS: Well, sir, I'm  
SCIENTIST: You are in my office at headquarters. I am your commanding General.  
CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir. I'm in the General's office.  
SCIENTIST: As you see, whatever he sees he transforms into something he can
understand. Now, what is this?  
CARSTAIRS: What, sir?  
SCIENTIST: This.  
CARSTAIRS: I'm sorry, sir, there's nothing there.  
SCIENTIST: Objects which are beyond his comprehension, he will not see at all.
Now, who are these people?  
CARSTAIRS: They're my brother officers, sir. Except those two people. Those
are German spies!

**[Countryside]**

(Buckingham is running from a man on horseback until she falls, exhausted. The
man dismounts and pulls her to her feet when Jamie gallops up, jumps on him
and knocks him out.)  
JAMIE: Come on! There'll be more of them after us!  
(Too late. There are rifles aimed at them from all sides.)

**[Lecture hall]**

(Carstairs has been strapped down again.)  
CARSTAIRS: But they're German spies! I was at the court martial! You've got to
believe me!  
(Carstairs is wheeled away.)  
SCIENTIST: I'll examine him later.  
DOCTOR: Well, I don't think much of that as a demonstration.  
SCIENTIST: Will you kindly return to your place?  
DOCTOR: The man was obviously unhinged as a result of your experiment.  
SCIENTIST: The experiment was successful.  
DOCTOR: Then why did he call me a German spy? It's obviously ridiculous, isn't
it.  
SCIENTIST: The aberration is only temporary. He was probably involved with
tracking down some German spies before he came here. It has obviously become a
fixation.  
DOCTOR: Huh. Then he's obviously no use for our purposes, is he.  
(The Doctor opens up the brain-washing apparatus.)  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, just as I thought. This is your trouble, you know.  
SCIENTIST: Will you leave this apparatus alone?  
DOCTOR: Yes, this circuit is overloading the neural paths.  
SCIENTIST: You are here in the capacity of a student.  
DOCTOR: You didn't de-process that man first, did you.  
SCIENTIST: There was no need. His processing had completely lapsed. You saw
that for yourself.  
DOCTOR: I saw a man whose processing had partly lapsed. You should have
completely de-processed him first, but I don't suppose you can do that on a
machine like this.  
SCIENTIST: Of course we can. It is simply a case of reprogramming these
circuits here.  
DOCTOR: What there?  
SCIENTIST: And here.  
DOCTOR: Yes?  
SCIENTIST: And here.  
DOCTOR: Oh.

**[Barn]**

(Jamie and Buckingham are dumped down next to Harper. Their hands are tied in
front of them.)  
BUCKINGHAM: Who are you? Why did you help us?  
HARPER: You came from one of those other wars.  
JAMIE: You know what's going on, then?  
HARPER: You see those guys over there? They think they're fighting the war
between the States. This isn't even America.  
BUCKINGHAM: Where do you think it is, then?  
HARPER: Look, you came through one of those mists to get here, right?  
JAMIE: Right.  
HARPER: Well, every time you go through one of those mists you're in some
other war, some other place.  
BUCKINGHAM: How long have you realised this?  
HARPER: I started noticing things quite a while back. Then I found some other
guys who are the same.  
JAMIE: You mean there's more like you?  
HARPER: Oh, there are gangs of us hiding in the woods. We are trying to fight  
VON WEICH: Now we have combed the entire area and we still haven't found your
friends.  
JAMIE: Just a moment.  
VON WEICH: Now you-all are going to tell me where they are.  
JAMIE: I've seen you before,  
(Gunshots. Leroy enters.)  
LEROY: Attack coming from the direction of the woods, sir.  
VON WEICH: Get a patrol out there! Keep them back.  
(Soldiers from different races and wars rush in and overpower the Americans.
Von Weich shoots a few and tries to make his escape but is surrounded. A
cossack unties the captives.)  
JAMIE: What are you going to do to him?  
HARPER: Kill him, of course. He's one of the people running things around
here.  
JAMIE: Nom you mustn't, we need him.  
HARPER: Get out of the way, boy, or I'll have to kill you too!

**[Lecture hall]**

SCIENTIST: You see, it's perfectly simple. With the circuits arranged in this
manner, the machine removes all traces any previous processing.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I see. Yes, that's fascinating.  
SCIENTIST: And since we have now exceeded the time allotted for this
demonstration, I suggest you all continue to your next assignment.  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Come along, Zoe.  
(An alarm sounds and the Doctor removes his visor. Guards rush in, then the
War Chief enters.)  
WAR CHIEF: Was the experiment successful?  
SCIENTIST: Partly, partly. But the specimen showed signs of mental unbalance
after the process.  
WAR CHIEF: Then the modifications were not successful?  
SCIENTIST: But I think we've found the cause. One of the students has been
extremely helpful to me. That one over there.  
DOCTOR: Run, Zoe, run!  
WAR CHIEF: Stop them! Stop them!  
(Chaos as the Doctor and Zoe get away. Just outside, Carstairs has been
struggling with his restraints and now frees himself as the alarm rips through
his head.)

**[War room]**

WAR CHIEF: Emergency alert, emergency alert. This is the War Chief to all
guard posts. Close section areas. Detain two resistance members.

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

(Zoe enters alone. Carstairs creeps up behind her and puts his hand over her
mouth.)  
ZOE: Oh, Lieutenant Carstairs, thank goodness! We thought that  
(Carstairs points his revolver at her.)  
ZOE: Well, what are you doing? It's me, Zoe!  
CARSTAIRS: You're a German spy. A German spy. It's my duty to shoot you.  
(Carstairs squeezes the trigger.)

__**Episode Five**__

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

SCIENTIST: Carstairs! Well done, Lieutenant. You've captured a dangerous spy.  
CARSTAIRS: Yes, and this time she won't escape.  
SCIENTIST: Lieutenant, we mustn't kill her.  
CARSTAIRS: But she's a spy. She must die. She must  
(Carstairs finishes squeezing the trigger, but the chamber is not loaded.)  
SCIENTIST: Lieutenant Carstairs, I am your superior officer. You will obey my
commands.  
CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir. Prisoner delivered, sir.  
SCIENTIST: Take her away. Security section.  
(Zoe is taken away by guards.)  
SCIENTIST: Now, Lieutenant, we have work to do. Come with me.

**[Barn]**

(Von Weich is tied up and has a rifle barrel pointed at his chest by a genuine
Highlander.)  
JAMIE: You realise we have saved your life?  
BUCKINGHAM: I don't think he's going to be grateful. We're lucky they didn't
kill all three of us.  
JAMIE: Look, how long are we going to be kept here?  
HARPER: Until Russell arrives. He'll decide what to do with you.  
JAMIE: Well, who's Russell?  
HARPER: He's our Captain, he'll be along.  
(Harper goes to Von Weich.)  
HARPER: Where is it? Are you going to tell me where that tunnel is?  
BUCKINGHAM: What tunnel?  
HARPER: Look, we've been watching this place. It's where the recruits keep
coming from.  
BUCKINGHAM: But what makes you think there's a tunnel?  
HARPER: Come on, we see the recruits come out of here.  
JAMIE: Look, there's no tunnel. They come out of a big green box, a sort of
machine.  
HARPER: A what? Machine? Look, is he crazy or something?  
BUCKINGHAM: I know it's difficult to believe, but it is true. I've seen it
myself.  
HARPER: Oh, come on, quit kidding about, huh? We've got to find that tunnel.  
BUCKINGHAM: But even if you do find out how the troops get here, what good is
it going to do you?  
HARPER: Maybe we can get out of here back to where we came from.  
BUCKINGHAM: Where do you think you are?  
HARPER: Look, I don't know. All I know is I was brought here and I want to
find my way out, right?  
(A bearded Yorkshire Redcoat enters.)  
SPENCER: You found your tunnel yet?  
HARPER: Oh, we're still looking.  
SPENCER: The supplies are loaded. Let's get out of here.  
HARPER: Not until we find that tunnel.  
SPENCER: There's no tunnel. We've got the supplies. Let's go.  
(Spencer takes aim at Von Weich.)  
HARPER: Hey, do you think you're doing?  
SPENCER: We can't afford to take prisoners.  
HARPER: Oh no, you don't!  
(They wrestle for the rifle, and Harper wins. Spencer starts a brief fight and
gets it back. He aims it at Harper, gets restrained by a Mexican and Harper
punches him. Then they start brawling again. Jamie and Buckingham make for the
barn door but a Boer war soldier enters and fires his pistol in the air.)  
RUSSELL: Get up. Up! You're just like a couple of kids, aren't you? I leave
you alone and you start fighting amongst yourselves.  
SPENCER: He started it. You ask any of them.  
HARPER: We were taking prisoners. He wanted to shoot them.  
RUSSELL: All right, all right! Spencer, take those stores over to our HQ.  
(Spencer leaves.)  
RUSSELL: You ought to know better, Harper.  
HARPER: He wanted to shoot him. I couldn't let him.  
(Jamie spots Von Weich opening up a panel in the barn wall and grabs him. It
is a video monitor.)  
JAMIE: Look at that! Now do you believe us?

**[Security section]**

(No keyhole doors and plastic hangings, but a swirly design on the walls that
makes your eyes ache. A guard drags Zoe in and makes her sit down.)  
ZOE: What's going to happen? What are you going to do to me? Well, you might
answer me!  
(A small man with round glasses and a nasal voice walks up onto a long dais
across the room.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: You are the one who will answer the questions.  
ZOE: Who are you? I won't tell you anything!  
(The Chief brings over a helmet device, puts it on his own head, lowers a
monocular in front of his eyes and turns it on. He adjusts the focus.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: What is you name?  
(Zoe is mesmerised.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: My name is  
ZOE: Zoe Heriot.  
SECURITY CHIEF: To which resistance group do you belong? When did you join the
resistance?  
ZOE: I did not join the resistance.  
SECURITY CHIEF: I joined the resistance. What time do you come from?  
ZOE: The twenty first century.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Impossible. There is no twenty first century Time Zone. I was
born in  
ZOE: I was born in the twenty first century.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Try again. I was born in  
ZOE: I was born in the twenty first century.  
SECURITY CHIEF: You were first reported in the 1917 Time Zone.  
ZOE: Yes.  
SECURITY CHIEF: How did you get there?  
ZOE: I arrived in the Tardis.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Tardis? What does that mean?  
ZOE: Time and relative dimensions in space. It's a space ship.  
SECURITY CHIEF: You have a space ship?  
ZOE: The ship belongs to the Doctor.  
SECURITY CHIEF: I'm going to show you some photographs. You will identify
anyone know to you, particularly this doctor.  
(A series of images appear on Zoe's face.)

**[Processing room]**

(On the run, the Doctor backs into where the Scientist has got Carstairs on an
examination table.)  
SCIENTIST: What are you doing in here?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I was so interested in your demonstration I felt I had to come
along and see how you were getting along.  
SCIENTIST: But you? There's a security alarm out for you.  
DOCTOR: Really? Why?  
SCIENTIST: The War Chief, he pointed you out.  
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. Not me, the girl.  
SCIENTIST: Then why did you run?  
DOCTOR: Well I was trying to catch her, of course. Has she been caught?  
SCIENTIST: Yes. I sent her to the security section for questioning.  
DOCTOR: Oh good. How are you getting on with him?  
SCIENTIST: I'm just about to reprocess him.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, this is interesting. I think you'll find that bit goes just
there. Will there be enough of these advanced models ready for our major plan?  
SCIENTIST: If I knew the precise timing of the plan that would be easier to
answer.  
DOCTOR: Oh but surely you must know, in your position.  
SCIENTIST: Yes of course, just as you do. But only the War Chief knows the
timing. Now really, I am very busy.  
DOCTOR: I would consider it a great honour if I could simply stand and watch.  
SCIENTIST: Oh, very well.  
DOCTOR: Thank you. What are we doing now?  
SCIENTIST: I am about to de-process him, just as you suggested at my lecture.  
DOCTOR: Oh I see. Yes, this is intriguing. Will he remember everything when he
wakes up?  
SCIENTIST: Yes, he'll remember everything. Would you strap him down, please?
As soon as the de-processing is completed everything will return to normal.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, certainly.  
(The Doctor makes a pretence of tying a knot.)  
DOCTOR: There we are! Is the de-processing complete?  
SCIENTIST: Yes.  
CARSTAIRS: Oh where am I? Oh, Doctor.  
SCIENTIST: You! He recognises you! You're one of  
DOCTOR: No, no, please. Don't hurt him. Get him off.  
(Carstairs grabs the Scientist.)  
DOCTOR: No, don't hurt him. Put him on there. In the machine, quick!  
(Carstairs pushes the Scientist onto the table and the Doctor clamps the
brainwash machine around his head then turns it on.)  
DOCTOR: Hoist with his own petard. Come along, Lieutenant. Lieutenant?  
CARSTAIRS: Doctor, where are we?  
DOCTOR: What? Well, what do you remember?  
CARSTAIRS: Well, I remember you and Lady Jennifer. And I was captured, wasn't
I?  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, unfortunately. And brought here, to the aliens war
centre and brainwashed again, but you're all right now.  
CARSTAIRS: Oh, I see!  
DOCTOR: I'll explain as we go along. We must find Zoe. Oh.  
(The Doctor turns the machine down a bit.)  
DOCTOR: Better leave him on simmer.

**[Barn]**

RUSSELL: You expect me to believe all this?  
JAMIE: Yes! They use that thing to talk to each other. Don't touch it!  
BUCKINGHAM: It works like a telephone.  
RUSSELL: And you say that something appears in the middle of this barn and
hundreds of men get out of it? A box?  
JAMIE: Aye, we've both seen it.  
(Von Weich gets to the monitor and presses something.)  
JAMIE: Get him off!  
RUSSELL: What's that noise?  
JAMIE: Don't know.  
VON WEICH: You'll find out soon enough.

**[Central Control]**

TECHNICIAN: This is Central Control, what is your emergency? This is Central
Control, what is your emergency?

**[Security section]**

WAR CHIEF: Did she identify her friends?  
SECURITY CHIEF: No, they are not on our files of resistance people.  
WAR CHIEF: Then they must be a small independent group.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Yes, five of them. First reported in the 1917 Time Zone. One
has been caught and is being reprocessed, two believed still at large in the
American Civil War Zone.  
WAR CHIEF: And one still at large in this control.  
SECURITY CHIEF: He will be caught.  
WAR CHIEF: He's evaded your security guards so far. Perhaps he will continue
to do so? From which time does she originate?  
SECURITY CHIEF: She was a nurse like the other girl. 1917.  
WAR CHIEF: And the man?  
SECURITY CHIEF: The same, 1917.  
WAR CHIEF: Why did they come here?  
SECURITY CHIEF: They had some confused idea they were getting home.  
WAR CHIEF: She told you nothing else? Everything quite straightforward?  
SECURITY CHIEF: Yes. The normal pattern of resistance activity. did you expect
something else?  
TECHNICIAN: Emergency call from the American Civil War Zone sir.  
WAR CHIEF: What's wrong?  
TECHNICIAN: The signal was activated, but there was no message, no contact at
all.  
WAR CHIEF: All right, I'll deal with it. Come with me.  
SECURITY CHIEF: But the girl.  
WAR CHIEF: She can wait.

**[Control area]**

(The War Chief walks away. The Doctor and Carstairs come out of hiding.)  
DOCTOR: That must be the Security Room.  
(The Security Chief walks past.)

**[Security section]**

DOCTOR: Zoe, what have they done to you? Don't you point that thing at me! You
ought to be ashamed of yourself, treating a poor young girl like  
(The Doctor walks round the guard so that Carstairs can come up behind him and
knock him out.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, well done.  
(The Doctor waves his smelling salts under Zoe's nose.)  
DOCTOR: There we are. Now, are you feeling better?  
ZOE: Oh my head! What happened?  
DOCTOR: That's was just the question I was going to ask you. What did happen?  
ZOE: They questioned me. Someone came in, put on that strange headset and
questioned me.  
DOCTOR: Let's have a look. Oh yes, it's a very interesting little gadget.  
ZOE: I saw pictures of people.  
DOCTOR: Really? Oh, well, let's try it, shall we?  
(The Doctor puts the interrogation helmet on.)  
DOCTOR: Now then, where does this switch? Oh yes, oh, with a slight adjustment  
(Pictures of Russell and Harper flicker back and forth.)  
DOCTOR: There we are. Yes. What questions did they ask you about these people,
Zoe?  
ZOE: He was talking about the resistance. At first he seemed to think I was
one of them.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, the resistance, of course. Yes. That's the American Civil War.
The 1914-18 war. Yes, it's all recorded here. Scattered groups of resistance.  
(The Doctor takes the helmet off.)  
DOCTOR: Now if we could organise. Zoe, can you remember all the details about
the resistance from that thing? Names, faces, Time Zones and so on?  
ZOE: Yes, of course I can.  
DOCTOR: Good. Then we can return to the Time Zones and organise the resistance
into one big army! That way they'll have a better chance.  
CARSTAIRS: But how do we get back?  
DOCTOR: Well, that's simple. The way we came. Come on.  
ZOE: Oh Doctor, are you sure?

**[Central Control]**

TECHNICIAN: Still no message sir, just the emergency signal.  
WAR CHIEF: Well? This is your sphere of responsibility.  
(War Chief leaves.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: Arrange transportation for guards.  
TECHNICIAN: Central control to Landing Bay, transportation required for
security guards.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Security squad to report to Landing Bay immediately. Proceed
to American Civil War Zone to investigate reported emergency.

**[Central area]**

(An alarm goes off and the Doctor, Zoe and Carstairs hide as three rubber-
suited guards march through with weapons.)  
ZOE: What was all that about?  
DOCTOR: I don't know, but they're going to the landing bay. Come on.  
(The trio watch as the guards go into a SIDRAT and it dematerialises.)

**[Barn]**

HARPER: I've posted sentries all around. If they should send in any troops,
our outposts will warn us.  
RUSSELL: Good.  
BUCKINGHAM: What if they send one of those things the Doctor went off in?  
JAMIE: Aye, that's what they'll do. Then they can attack us from inside.  
RUSSELL: They've got to get inside first.  
JAMIE: No you don't understand.  
(Materialisation sound.)  
JAMIE: Quick, hide! In here, Lady Jennifer.  
(A SIDRAT appears. Two of the guards come out. Harper approaches them and they
use their weapons on him. He falls, staring at nothing. The rest of the
resistance grab the guards from behind.)  
SOLDIER: Hold it there!  
JAMIE: Well, we dealt with those all right, didn't we?  
(Russell takes one of the weapons and goes over to where Harper is lying.)  
RUSSELL: There's not a mark on him. But he's dead. But what are these things,
how do they work?  
JAMIE: Hey, careful!  
RUSSELL: They don't work.  
JAMIE: Aye, well, you probably have to do something very special with them.  
RUSSELL: Your green box machine.  
JAMIE: Aye, just what we need.

**[War room]**

SECURITY CHIEF: This emergency call could be resistance activity. There is a
large group operating in the American Civil War Zone.  
WAR CHIEF: There seem to be large groups operating in most Zones, and now
they're even infiltrating here.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Only two of them and one of those has already been caught.  
WAR CHIEF: Had I not pointed them out, you wouldn't have even known they were
here.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Yes, that has been puzzling me. Just how did you recognise
them?  
WAR CHIEF: You dare cross-question me?! The security of this entire venture is
being threatened by your incompetence. You will find this intruder!  
SECURITY CHIEF: The whole base is being searched. It is only a matter of time.
If the mental processing were fully effective  
WAR CHIEF: There would be no need for security. When I came to your people I
was promised efficiency and cooperation. Without the knowledge I have, this
complete venture would be impossible.  
SECURITY CHIEF: We have given you every facility. If you have complaints I
suggest you take them to the War Lord.  
WAR CHIEF: I intend to do so. And now I suggest you finish the interrogation
of that girl before she escapes as well.

**[Security section]**

(The Security Chief enters. He picks up the guard.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: Where is the girl? You fool, where is she?!

**[Barn]**

JAMIE: Do you not see, though? This thing could take us all back to the place
where it's controlled from!  
RUSSELL: How do you know?  
JAMIE: Oh, where do you think those two came from?  
RUSSELL: Well, is it true? Answer me.  
VON WEICH: Do you think I'd help you?  
RUSSELL: You'll do as you're told. Take those two away.  
JAMIE: Now look, you want to find out what's going on, don't you? Och, I can't
wait for you to make up your mind!  
BUCKINGHAM: Oh, wait for me.  
JAMIE: Ah, now, Lady Jennifer, I don't think you should come.  
BUCKINGHAM: Because I'm a woman?  
JAMIE: No, er, well, in a way, yes.  
BUCKINGHAM: That settles it then. I'm certainly coming. You can't go alone.  
RUSSELL: No, you're right, miss, he can't. I'm going with him. But you're
staying here.  
BUCKINGHAM: Oh now, look here!  
RUSSELL: You're a nurse, you said?  
BUCKINGHAM: Yes, but what's that got to do with it?  
RUSSELL: I've got hundreds of injured men back at my headquarters. They need
the help of someone like you.  
BUCKINGHAM: Yes, I suppose you're right. Tell Lieutenant Carstairs that. Well,
tell him I'll see him when you all get back.  
JAMIE: Right.  
BUCKINGHAM: Good luck.  
JAMIE: Oh, thank you.  
RUSSELL: Take her back to our headquarters. Thank you, Miss.  
(Buckingham leaves. Russell goes over to Von Weich.)  
RUSSELL: You. Guard him. If he gives you any trouble, shoot him. You two,
you're coming with me. Come on, move!  
JAMIE [OC]: Door's closing!  
RUSSELL: Quick! Come on!

**[Processing room]**

(The Security Chief releases the Scientist from the brain-washing machine.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: What happened?  
SCIENTIST: That young officer got away.  
SECURITY CHIEF: How?  
SCIENTIST: Oh, the one in the lecture who asked all the questions, he tricked
me. I must report this to the War Chief.  
SECURITY CHIEF: No! You two, wait outside.  
(The guards leave.)  
SCIENTIST: But he must be informed.  
SECURITY CHIEF: These people are no ordinary resistance group. The girl said
they have the secret of space time travel.  
SCIENTIST: That's impossible.  
SECURITY CHIEF: She was under the truth machine.  
SCIENTIST: But the War Chief. He's the only one who understands space time
travel.  
SECURITY CHIEF: And his people.  
SCIENTIST: What are you suggesting?  
SECURITY CHIEF: He is not one of our race. Who knows where his true loyalties
lie?  
SCIENTIST: But he came to us of his own accord.  
SECURITY CHIEF: He is a traitor to his own people. How can we be sure he is
not a traitor to us?

**[War room]**

TECHNICIAN: Transportation returning from the American Civil War Zone, sir.  
WAR CHIEF: Good.  
TECHNICIAN: But they're not following the routine, sir. They haven't called
in.  
WAR CHIEF: Have you tried to make contact?  
TECHNICIAN: Yes, sir.  
WAR CHIEF: All right, inform the Security Chief. No! No, I'll handle this
myself. This is the War Chief to Security section. All guards to landing bay.
The following procedure will be carried out

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

(The Doctor, Zoe and Carstairs are hiding behind the control panel.)  
ZOE: How long have we got to wait here, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Until one of those things arrives. If I can get inside I'm sure I can
control it.  
CARSTAIRS: The alarm signal. They've probably found that guard.  
DOCTOR: The light's flashing. That means an arrival.  
(A troop of guards enter and line up.)  
ZOE: It looks as though somebody important's coming.  
(The guards aim their weapons at the materialising SIDRAT. The door opens and
Jamie creeps holding a revolver, followed by Russell and an assortment of
nationalities.)  
ZOE: It's an ambush!  
(The guards cut them all down, including Jamie.)

__**Episode Six**__

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

ZOE: Oh Jamie! Doctor, we've got to help them!  
DOCTOR: No, there's nothing we can do.  
CARSTAIRS: We must get away from here.  
ZOE: But we can't. Jamie. We can't.  
CARSTAIRS: Do you want us all to get killed? Go on!  
(The guards drag their victims away.)

**[Central area]**

ZOE: Oh Doctor, what about Jamie? Have they killed him?  
DOCTOR: I don't know!  
CARSTAIRS: Let's go this way.  
DOCTOR: No, no, this way to the processing room.  
CARSTAIRS: Why do you want to go to the processing room?  
DOCTOR: Don't ask questions, just follow me.  
ZOE: Oh!

**[Security section]**

SECURITY CHIEF: I believe that amongst this resistance group that attacked the
base are people who have arrived on this planet without being brought here by
us.  
SCIENTIST: That's impossible!  
SECURITY CHIEF: Is it? What about the girl Zoe, and this man the Doctor she
spoke of? She said he had a space time travel machine.  
SCIENTIST: Yes I know, but  
SECURITY CHIEF: Have we taken humans from later than the Earth year 1917?  
SCIENTIST: Of course not. Greater technological knowledge would be dangerous.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Yet this man who tricked you had sufficient technological
knowledge to understand the mental processing machinery.  
SCIENTIST: Yes, that's true. But how could these people get here?  
SECURITY CHIEF: The War Chief. His people have the secret of time travel.  
SCIENTIST: Are you suggesting he's bringing in his own people, the Time Lords?  
SECURITY CHIEF: He came to us because he wanted power. Perhaps there are
others of his people who feel the same.  
SCIENTIST: Can you prove this? If so, you must tell the War Lord immediately.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Unfortunately I have no proof. You must help me find proof. I
insist. This is a matter of security.  
SCIENTIST: All right, what do you want me to do?  
SECURITY CHIEF: These resistance people. Before you reprocess them, study them
carefully. If you find anything unusual send the prisoner concerned to me for
questioning.

**[Central area]**

(There are guards near the Processing room.)  
DOCTOR: We've got to get in there.  
CARSTAIRS: Why?  
DOCTOR: Now that room, the other side. That must've been next door. Yes, come
on.  
CARSTAIRS: Now what's he up to?  
ZOE: I've no idea, but I think we'd better follow. Come on.

**[Clothing store]**

(The Doctor, Zoe and Carstairs push their way through hanging racks of
greatcoats, to the wall adjoining the processing room.)  
DOCTOR: Some sort of preformed plastic, wouldn't you say, Zoe?  
ZOE: Yes, but why are you so interested in it, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Little bits of metal imbedded in it. Yes, I think these panels must be
held together by some kind of magnetic forcefield. Now if I could reverse that
field. Cut me off some pieces of tape, will you please, Zoe?  
ZOE: Oh yes.  
DOCTOR: That's right. One there, that's right. And one just there.  
(The Doctor tapes pieces of wire over the curves in the plastic panel.)

**[Processing room]**

(Jamie, Russell and other soldiers lie in a heap in the corner while the
Scientist uses his helmet device to view another man's brain.)  
SCIENTIST: All right, take him away.

**[Clothing store]**

CARSTAIRS: Doctor, what on Earth are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's no secret, boy, it's simply a case of reversing the
magnetic field of this panel.  
ZOE: Doctor, why don't you use your sonic screwdriver as a power source?  
DOCTOR: What a good idea, yes.  
ZOE: There's just one thing though.  
DOCTOR: Yes?  
ZOE: All these panels are interlinked.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well?  
ZOE: Well, if you take one away what's to stop all the rest down like a pack
of cards?  
DOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to take that risk, won't we? Now then, stand
well clear.  
(The Doctor attaches his sonic screwdriver to one end of the final long wire
linking all the rest. The panel glows briefly.)  
CARSTAIRS: Nothing's happened.  
DOCTOR: Watch.  
(The Doctor gently removes the panel and sets it down so they look in through
a gap over the top. Jamie is being placed on the examination table.)  
ZOE: It's Jamie! He's alive!  
DOCTOR: I hoped he might be.  
ZOE: But how? They shot him down.  
DOCTOR: Well, the guns they use can be adjusted. I think he was just stunned.

**[Processing room]**

(The Scientist stares into Jamie's brain and sees a regular pattern of oblongs
instead of a swirly brain-like one.)  
SCIENTIST: He was right. Take this prisoner to the Security Chief for
questioning.

**[Clothing store]**

ZOE: Doctor, why are they taking him away?  
DOCTOR: I think they've possibly discovered that he was never processed.  
CARSTAIRS: We'd better get him out of there, then.  
DOCTOR: No, no, wait.

**[Processing room]**

WAR CHIEF: Have you started the reprocessing yet?  
SCIENTIST: No, I've just been carrying out the preliminary examinations.  
WAR CHIEF: Why? Why not just reprocess them?  
SCIENTIST: I, well, these people have shown considerable courage and
enterprise. They may make future leaders.  
WAR CHIEF: Where is this prisoner being taken?  
SCIENTIST: Oh, the Security Chief. He wants to question one of them before
reprocessing.  
WAR CHIEF: Really? Why this one in particular?  
SCIENTIST: Oh, he just seemed to be the most suitable.  
WAR CHIEF: For what reason? For what reason!  
SCIENTIST: His brain patterns are different.  
WAR CHIEF: Different how?  
SCIENTIST: Well, he appears not to have been processed before.  
WAR CHIEF: Really? How interesting. All right, carry on. (The guards carry
Jamie away.)  
WAR CHIEF: But in future inform me of all such unusual developments.  
(The War Chief leaves.)  
SCIENTIST: Prepare the reprocessing machine. We shall begin with this one.

**[Clothing store]**

ZOE: Oh Doctor, we're too late. Where have they taken him?  
DOCTOR: I don't know, but don't worry, at least we know that he's alive. Now
then, we've got to get in there. Lieutenant?  
CARSTAIRS: Right, sir.

**[Processing room]**

(While the Scientist adjusts his brain-washing machine, Carstairs goes through
the hole in the wall and grabs the scientist's assistant. He bundles him
unceremoniously back into the clothing store.)  
DOCTOR: I think you'll find that bit goes there.  
SCIENTIST: Ah, thank you!

**[Barn]**

VON WEICH: How long do you intend keeping me here?  
MOOR: Until they come back.  
(David Troughton, Patrick's son.)  
VON WEICH: And supposing they don't come back?  
(Von Weich stands.)  
VON WEICH: I'd like some water.  
MOOR: All right. Sit down.  
(Trying to keep his rifle aimed at Von Weich all the time, Moor sidles towards
a canteen. As soon as he looks away, Von Weich tries to go for the
communications device.)  
MOOR: Stop! Try that again and I'll kill you.

**[Security section]**

SECURITY CHIEF: But who sent you here?  
JAMIE: Nobody sent us. I came with the Doctor.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Why did he decide to come to this planet?  
JAMIE: He didn't. It was an accident.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Accident? Explain.  
JAMIE: It's the Tardis, you see. He can't control it. We just arrived here.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Was the Doctor summoned here by one of us?  
JAMIE: No, we just arrived.  
(The War Chief and a guard enter.)  
WAR CHIEF: Don't let me interrupt you.  
SECURITY CHIEF: The questioning is over.  
WAR CHIEF: What have you learnt?  
SECURITY CHIEF: Nothing of importance.  
WAR CHIEF: Really? Will you be questioning the others?  
SECURITY CHIEF: They are all from the same resistance group. They will all
tell the same story.  
WAR CHIEF: But this one is different, surely?  
SECURITY CHIEF: Why should he be?  
WAR CHIEF: This one hasn't been processed before, has he?  
SECURITY CHIEF: It's possible.  
WAR CHIEF: It's a fact! Why was I not informed?  
SECURITY CHIEF: This is a matter of security. Security is my responsibility,
as you often remind me.  
WAR CHIEF: Your first responsibility is to me.  
SECURITY CHIEF: No! My first responsibility is to the War Lord and to my
people.  
WAR CHIEF: You don't trust me. But if you question my loyalty, tell the War
Lord. But I warn you, be absolutely sure of your suspicions because if you
accuse me without positive proof, I shall crush you.  

**[Processing room]**

(The Doctor is using his smelling salts on Russell while Carstairs reloads his
revolver.)  
CARSTAIRS: Can't you hurry it up?  
RUSSELL: What happened? Where am I?  
DOCTOR: It's all right. You're quite safe.  
RUSSELL: Who are you?  
DOCTOR: We're your friends.  
CARSTAIRS: You'll have to hurry it up, Doctor.  
RUSSELL: Doctor? You must be the one that Jamie was talking about. Where is
he?  
DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid that they've taken him away. Now, up you get.  
CARSTAIRS: Doctor, we're wasting time.  
(A guard comes past the open door to the central area and Carstairs shoots
him.)  
CARSTAIRS: Come on, Doctor, we must get out of here!  
DOCTOR: Quickly through the gap in the wall here, Zoe, help him.  
ZOE: Yes.  
(The Doctor tries to take the brain washing machine off its stand.)  
CARSTAIRS: Come on, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: I'll be a minute.  
(The alarm sounds. Carstairs shoots at another guard outside.)  
CARSTAIRS: Come on, Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Just a minute!  
CARSTAIRS: No, now. or we'll all be caught! Come on.  
(The Doctor abandons the machine.)

**[Clothing store]**

(Carstairs and the Doctor replace the wall panel.)  
RUSSELL: What is this place?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's the headquarters of the people who are running this whole
disgraceful business.  
RUSSELL: Just the people I want to get my hands on.  
DOCTOR: Yes, it's not quite as simple as that. There are rather a lot of them.  
RUSSELL: I don't care how many of them there are!  
DOCTOR: They have rather sophisticated weapons. You wouldn't stand a chance.  
RUSSELL: Oh. So what do we do now?  
DOCTOR: We're going to return to the time zones and organise the resistance
into one big army!  
RUSSELL: If you can find them. They're spread all over the place. I've been
trying to link them up myself, but it's finding them and you don't know who
you can trust.  
DOCTOR: Ah yes, we do now. My friend Zoe has memorised an entire list of the
resistance and their whereabouts.  
ZOE: Yes, I memorised the files when I was in the security room.  
DOCTOR: Now I must get you all back to the landing bay.  
CARSTAIRS: Those guards'll be all over the place.  
DOCTOR: Yes, what we need is some kind of disguise.

**[Barn]**

VON WEICH: British private, aren't you? Nineteenth century.  
MOOR: You can see that, can't you.  
VON WEICH: Oh would you mind reaching my monocle for me? It's in my pocket
there. Thank you.  
MOOR: Now sit down again.  
VON WEICH: Don't you talk to me like that. I'm a British Officer!  
MOOR: No, you're not. You're my prisoner.  
VON WEICH: I'm not your prisoner, Moor. I'm your commanding Officer. Do you
understand?  
MOOR: I'm not, I'm not in the army. The resistance I'm in!  
VON WEICH: You're in the British army, Private Moor, the year is 1871. You're
in the British army, and I'm your commanding Officer. Now, untie me.

**[Central area]**

SECURITY CHIEF: (to War Chief) They are in here, trapped. (to guards) Right,
in!

**[Processing room]**

SECURITY CHIEF: They were seen here by my men.  
WAR CHIEF: Where are they now, vanished into thin air?  
SECURITY CHIEF: There is only one way they could have escaped. By use of a
space time machine.  
(The War Chief goes across to the far wall and pushes at several panels.)  
WAR CHIEF: I'm sorry to crush your wild theories.  
(He pushes the loose panel.)  
WAR CHIEF: There's your space time machine.  
SECURITY CHIEF: After them!  
WAR CHIEF: You're too late for that. They will be on their way to the landing
bay by now, I should imagine. Try and get there before them.

**[Security section]**

(Jamie wakes to see a figure in a greatcoat and gas mask.)  
JAMIE: Ah!  
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie, it's me.  
JAMIE: Oh.  
DOCTOR: All right, put on this great coat.  
JAMIE: Where's Zoe? What's happened?  
DOCTOR: She's waiting outside. Now come along.

**[Central area]**

DOCTOR: Fall in by twos. Come along, hurry up. There's no time to be lost.  
JAMIE: Zoe.  
DOCTOR: Are you ready? Right. Quick march!

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

(Two soldiers grab the technician and drag him away.)  
ZOE: Are you sure you can work these controls, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so, Zoe. Now let me see.  
ZOE: There are more guards!  
DOCTOR: Oh my goodness!  
(The Doctor moves some control rods and sets up a protective force field.)  
DOCTOR: There, that should stop them!  
(Russell and Carstairs deal with the two that got through with help from
Jamie.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie! All right! Now, I'll preset it for the 1917 zone, and off we
go.  
ZOE: Doctor, how did you do it so easily?  
DOCTOR: It's not very difficult, Zoe. Now the doors.  
(A SIDRAT open.)  
DOCTOR: Come along. Don't be afraid, you've gone before.  
CARSTAIRS: After you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: No, no, I shall follow in a few moments.  
ZOE: You mean you're staying here?  
DOCTOR: No, but I must get the processing machine.  
JAMIE: Ah, if you're staying, I'd better stay too.  
CARSTAIRS: You can count on me then, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oh, very well. Go on, Zoe, off you go. We'll follow in a few minutes.
Good luck.  
(Zoe, Russell and the soldiers go into the SIDRAT and the Doctor
dematerialises it remotely.)  
CARSTAIRS: What are you going to do about those guards, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: We're going to let them in.  
(The guards run into an empty bay, then out again.)

**[Barn]**

VON WEICH: You understand now, Moor? I am your commanding Officer.  
MOOR: You, you are my Commanding Officer. Yes, sir.  
VON WEICH: Good, good. Now, Moor, give me your gun.  
(As Moor is about to hand it over, the SIDRAT materialises and Russell steps
out.)  
VON WEICH: Moor, shoot them! That's an order!  
RUSSELL: Back in there, quick. Moor? Moor, it's me, Russell.  
VON WEICH: Private Moor, shoot him.  
RUSSELL: Don't take any notice of him, Moor. You're one of us, one of the
resistance, remember?  
MOOR: Resistance? No, I'm in the army. Oh oh two three nine Moor. Private
Moor.  
VON WEICH: Shoot him!  
(Russell reaches out, grabs Moor's rifle barrel and disarms him. The two men
struggle and Moor gets Russell's service revolver from its holster. Russell
forces him to drop it and they continue fighting until Moor is knocked out.)  
VON WEICH: Stay.  
(Von Weich picks up the revolver.)  
VON WEICH: You come one step nearer you'll die. Good. Now you're both coming
back with me. Get inside the machine.  
RUSSELL: No, you'll have to shoot me first.  
VON WEICH: Very well, if you prefer to die that's your affair!  
(Gunshot! Von Weich falls to the ground with a bullet from Moor's rifle inside
him.)  
MOOR: I had to shoot him, didn't I?  
RUSSELL: Thank goodness you did, lad.  
MOOR: I'm not sure what happened.  
RUSSELL: You've just saved our lives, that's what happened.

**[Security section]**

(While Jamie helps the Doctor get the brain wash machine.)  
WAR CHIEF: So you have lost them. They have got away.  
SECURITY CHIEF: One of them knew how to operate our space time machines.  
WAR CHIEF: Are you blaming me for that?  
SECURITY CHIEF: You knew they would head for the landing bay. You knew one of
them could operate our machines.  
WAR CHIEF: Of course. That is, after all, how they got here. Logic seems to be
your weak point. Do something about this resistance group before the War Lord
arrives.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Wherever they are, I shall find them.

**[Processing room]**

JAMIE: Is this all right, Doctor?  
(Jamie holds out a knapsack.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, that's splendid. Put it in.  
(The Doctor puts the machine into it.)  
DOCTOR: There we are. That's it, right. Come on, off we go. Just a minute.
Hold that.  
(The Doctor hands the sack to Jamie.)  
JAMIE: Now what?  
CARSTAIRS: What are those, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: They're gas filled valves. Come on.  
(They run out of the room and the Scientist sneaks in.)

**[SIDRAT]**

(Wearing the gas mask, the Doctor throws one the gas filled valves onto the
landing bay floor. The technicians and guards collapse, and the Doctor
manipulates the controls to open a SIDRAT. They rush in and it
dematerialises.)  
JAMIE: Did we get away all right?  
DOCTOR: Yes I hope so, Jamie. There we go.  
(The sound suddenly stops.)  
DOCTOR: But, they must have stopped it from the outside.  
JAMIE: Well can they get in the doors?  
DOCTOR: No, not now. I've set the emergency lock.  
JAMIE: Will we still get away all right?  
DOCTOR: Yes, it's only a question of overriding the master control. Now, it's
a slightly different design to the Tardis.  
SECURITY CHIEF [OC]: Open the doors and surrender. You are trapped.

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

SECURITY CHIEF: There is no chance of escape! Surrender and we will spare your
lives.

**[SIDRAT]**

CARSTAIRS: What are you going to do, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Don't worry. These things are impregnable against outside attack.  
JAMIE: You mean like the Tardis?  
SECURITY CHIEF [OC]: This is your last chance. Surrender now!

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

WAR CHIEF: How do you propose to get them out?  
SECURITY CHIEF: We will wait. They will come out.  
WAR CHIEF: No, we won't wait. We'll force them out.  
SECURITY CHIEF: What do you intend to do?  
WAR CHIEF: Activate the dimensional control.

**[SIDRAT]**

JAMIE: Are we doing all right, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Very nicely, Jamie. Now, don't worry. Nothing can happen to us in
here.  
CARSTAIRS: Am I seeing things? The walls! Look!  
(The walls are getting closer.)  
JAMIE: And the ceiling too!  
DOCTOR: Oh, what have they done?  
(The ceiling drops, forcing the Doctor, Carstairs and Jamie to their knees.)

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

WAR CHIEF: You must surrender, Doctor, or you will all be crushed to death.
You have thirty seconds to decide.

**[SIDRAT]**

WAR CHIEF [OC]: Thirty seconds.

__**Episode Seven**__

**[SIDRAT]**

(The inside is now barely big enough to hold the three men.)  
WAR CHIEF [OC]: Thirty seconds before you are crushed to death.  
CARSTAIRS: What are we going to do, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: We've got no choice. We have to do what they say.  
WAR CHIEF [OC]: Twenty seconds!

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

(The War Chief moves more controls on the panel.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: What are you doing now?  
WAR CHIEF: Reducing the dimensions further.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Wait!  
(The SIDRAT opens and the Doctor crawls out waving a white handkerchief.)  
WAR CHIEF: Bring out the others.  
DOCTOR: What are you going to do with us?  
WAR CHIEF: Bring out the others!  
DOCTOR: I won't have my friends ill-treated, you know.  
SECURITY CHIEF: You are in no position to make terms.  
DOCTOR: I am here under a flag of truce. I demand to know what you are going
to do with us.  
WAR CHIEF: For the last time, tell your friends to come out. Or would you
sooner they were crushed to death?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I think that that's a perfectly horrid idea.  
(The Doctor throws down his last gas-filled diode.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: Guards, stop him!  
(While everyone else is choking on the gas, the Doctor has his handkerchief
over his mouth, dashes to the control panel, sets the dimension controls back
to normal and removes other control symbols before running back into the
SIDRAT and closing its door.)

**[SIDRAT]**

JAMIE: Oh, well done, Doctor.

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

(The SIDRAT dematerialises.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: Can't you stop them?  
WAR CHIEF: He's locked off the controls and taken the master circuit rods.
What an ingenious fellow he is.  
SECURITY CHIEF: His ingenuity could ruin everything. Alert all time zones!  
WAR CHIEF: I suggest we pay particular attention to the 1917 zone.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Is that where they are going?  
WAR CHIEF: I can't tell for sure. These master circuit rods could guide the
machine to any one of the time zones.

**[SIDRAT]**

(The Doctor puts the new control symbols on the panel by the door.)  
JAMIE: Well, where are we going, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Anywhere but the 1917 zone, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Are we not going back to Zoe and the Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Yes, eventually, but not just now. That's where they'll be looking for
us.  
CARSTAIRS: What are we going to do then, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Well, we'll go into one of the nearby zones and cross the time zone
barrier on foot. Oh! Ah, yes, here we are. (A final symbol goes on the panel.)

**[War room]**

SECURITY CHIEF: Haven't you traced them yet?  
WAR CHIEF: It's impossible to pick them up when the SIDRAT is still moving.
I'll pinpoint their position the moment it lands.  
SECURITY CHIEF: All time zones are ready to hunt them down as soon as you
provide the necessary information.  
(An alarm sounds.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: The War Lord is arriving from the home planet.  
WAR CHIEF: He's chosen rather an inconvenient time.  
SECURITY CHIEF: I shall go and receive him.  
WAR CHIEF: No, I'll receive him. You stay here and supervise the capture of
that resistance group.  
SECURITY CHIEF: The war Lord will expect me!  
WAR CHIEF: The War Lord will expect everything to be running smoothly and
under control, which, at the moment it isn't.  
(The War Chief leaves.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: Keep your eyes on the operations maps! I want to know the
moment that capsule arrives in a time zone.

**[SIDRAT]**

(Mealtime for a change. Carstairs and Jamie are eating apples.)  
JAMIE: Its taking its time, isn't it?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. I probably confused the controls readjusting them in
space, in  
CARSTAIRS: You've no idea which zone we're going to land in, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Well, no, not really, no.  
JAMIE: Oh, just like the Tardis, eh?  
(The SIDRAT rematerialises.)  
DOCTOR: Come on, here we go. Help me on with the processing machine. Now
remember, as soon as we land we must make ourselves scarce.  
JAMIE: Eh?  
DOCTOR: Well they're bound to be on the alert for us.

**[War room]**

SECURITY CHIEF: Alert the Roman zone commanders in sector five. Transmit map
references and order troops to surround the area. These resistance people must
be captured or destroyed.  
(A technician leaves. A man in black with the War Chief and an armed guard has
arrived.)  
WAR LORD: So my information is correct. I've heard disquieting rumours of
serious trouble here. Are they true?  
(Philip Madoc is back.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: There have been temporary difficulties.  
WAR LORD: But they have been overcome?  
SECURITY CHIEF: Almost.  
WAR LORD: War Chief. The defective processing machinery, has it been
rectified?  
WAR CHIEF: Your scientists did get effective machines, but  
WAR LORD: But what?  
WAR CHIEF: Unfortunately, it was removed by an intruding party of resistance
men.  
WAR LORD: They penetrated the control area? They just walked in? How?  
SECURITY CHIEF: I have the situation under control, War Lord. It is only a
matter of time before they are recaptured.  
WAR LORD: Then I hope that time is on your side.  
(A technician brings a report to the Security Chief.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: Report from the Roman zone.

**[Hillside]**

(Carstairs is looking at a map as they walk.)  
CARSTAIRS: Are you sure this is the right way, sir?  
DOCTOR: Well, I don't know. It's rather difficult to tell, isn't it.  
JAMIE: I think it is, Doctor. I seem to remember that hill.  
CARSTAIRS: Isn't this where we were attacked by the Romans?  
DOCTOR: Huh?  
(And here they come again, charging along the ridge.)  
DOCTOR: Come on! Back to the time zone barrier!

**[War room]**

WAR CHIEF: They're escaping again. Moving back to the time zone barrier. Our
processed Roman legions won't be able to follow them there.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Then we will send in my security guards from the control
centre.  
WAR CHIEF: No, not again. We are carrying out a delicately controlled
operation. The presence of guards in the time zones could stretch he credulity
of the processed humans. It would be most dangerous.  
SECURITY CHIEF: It will be even more dangerous if we allow this Doctor to
remain alive.  
WAR CHIEF: Have you looked for this space time machine of theirs?  
SECURITY CHIEF: What use is that to us?  
WAR CHIEF: They will no doubt try to return to it. That's where we should be
looking for them. It's a simple enough conclusion. You might even have reached
it yourself.  
SECURITY CHIEF: I have reached a number of conclusions about you and about
this man, the Doctor.  
WAR CHIEF: Indeed? Then perhaps you'd like to share them with us?  
SECURITY CHIEF: This Doctor arrived here on this planet we have chosen for the
war games. He brought with him companions who have not been subjected to our
mental processing.  
WAR CHIEF: A fact you tried to conceal.  
SECURITY CHIEF: They came in a space time machine. The secret of space time
travel is known only to you and to your people.  
WAR CHIEF: And I brought that secret here.  
SECURITY CHIEF: You have shown us how to operate these machines, but not how
to construct them. These people were summoned by one who is in league with his
own kind, plotting to betray us!  
WAR CHIEF: You cannot produce one single atom of proof!  
SECURITY CHIEF: The accumulation of evidence is overwhelming!  
WAR LORD: That's enough! That's enough from both of you. Now, I am tired of
this eternal bickering. Your inability to work together is endangering our
whole plan. You have a choice. Co-operate or be replaced.

**[Mist]**

JAMIE: Are we safe in here, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, they can't follow us into a time zone barrier. Oh,
Lieutenant Carstairs, do you feel all right?  
CARSTAIRS: Perfectly, why?  
DOCTOR: Oh, good. That means the processing machine is working all right.  
JAMIE: Oh, where do we go from now, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Just follow me, Jamie.  
(The three men arrive to the sound of distant warfare. A man in a small
weapons emplacement gets on his field telephone.)

**[British command post]**

(The Sergeant Major takes the call.)  
BURNS: I'll tell General Smythe immediately, sir. Excuse me, sir.  
SMYTHE: What is it?  
BURNS: Report from number three observation point, sir. Three persons spotted
answering to the descriptions of the two spies and the officer wanted for
desertion, sir.  
SMYTHE: Map?  
BURNS: They'd be just about, er, here, sir.  
SMYTHE: How very convenient. Right next to a machine gun emplacement.

**[No Man's Land]**

(The Doctor, Jamie and Carstairs run down the muddy bank near the machine gun.
The Doctor falls.)  
CARSTAIRS: Come on, Doctor.  
(The machine gun fires.)  
CARSTAIRS: Take cover! They've got us pinned down.  
(To the rear of the machine gunners are Zoe and two resistance fighters. They
knock out the gunners with their musket butts. The Doctor, Jamie and Carstairs
have been surrounded by British troops.)  
ZOE: No, don't shoot. You'll hit my friends. We'll follow them.

**[British command post]**

SMYTHE: You've caused me a great deal of trouble.  
DOCTOR: Good, I'm very glad to hear it. I suppose you're going to subject us
to another one of your farcical courts martial?  
SMYTHE: In your case, that won't be necessary. You have already been condemned
to death.  
DOCTOR: And what about my friends?  
SMYTHE: They will be given the chance to redeem themselves, in the most
dangerous sector of the front line.  
DOCTOR: After some more of your mental processing, I suppose?  
SMYTHE: They will have the opportunity of making the supreme sacrifice for
their King and country.  
CARSTAIRS: You can drop all that nonsense. We know what's going on.  
SMYTHE: Do you, Carstairs?  
CARSTAIRS: Yes. This isn't the war. We're not even on our own planet. Do you
realise that, Sergeant Major? This General of yours isn't even a human being.  
(Smythe puts on his spectacles.)  
SMYTHE: The prisoner is delirious, Sergeant Major. He's talking nonsense.  
BURNS: Yes, sir, delirious, sir. Talking nonsense, sir.  
CARSTAIRS: Listen to me, Sergeant Major!  
SMYTHE: It's no use, Carstairs. Nothing you say will have any effect. Sergeant
Major, prepare a firing squad.  
BURNS: Sir!  
(Burns leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Do you have the authority to have me killed?  
SMYTHE: I don't need any authority.  
DOCTOR: Your alien superiors will want to question me.  
SMYTHE: You've caused me a great deal of trouble and embarrassment. Now, I'm
afraid, you're going to pay for it with your life!  
DOCTOR: So you're simply being malicious!  
SMYTHE: Revenge can be very satisfying.  
BURNS: Firing party ready, sir!  
SMYTHE: Take him away!  
JAMIE: Look, leave him alone!  
SOLDIER: Come along!  
SMYTHE: Keep these other two here.

**[Smythe's room]**

(Smythe reports in on the video link.)  
SMYTHE: Smythe, 1917 zone. I have recaptured three of the escaped prisoners.  
WAR CHIEF [OC]: Excellent!

**[War room]**

WAR CHIEF: I want them sent here immediately.  
SMYTHE [on monitor]: Unfortunately one of them is already dead.  
WAR CHIEF: Which one?  
SMYTHE [on monitor]: The one that calls himself the Doctor. He was shot trying
to escape.  
WAR CHIEF: Did you recover the machine?  
SMYTHE [on monitor]: Machine?  
WAR CHIEF: Didn't you receive your instructions? They took with them the new
processing machine. It must be recovered!  
SMYTHE [on monitor]: Yes, of course I will.  
WAR CHIEF: Don't fail us, Smythe. The War Lord is here and he doesn't like
failures.

**[British command post]**

JAMIE: (sotto) We've got to try and save the Doctor.  
CARSTAIRS: (sotto) I wouldn't get anywhere near him.  
(Smythe enters.)  
JAMIE: (sotto) How about if I  
CARSTAIRS: (sotto) Quiet.  
SMYTHE: That machine you took, where is it? Where is it?!  
CARSTAIRS: The Doctor's got it.  
BURNS [OC]: Firing squad, attention! Load!  
CARSTAIRS: Only the Doctor knows where it is. You kill him, you'll never get
it back.  
BURNS: Squad, aim. Squad  
SMYTHE: Stop!  
(Gunfire outside.)  
SMYTHE: Jesus!  
(Smythe draws his revolver and goes to the door. He fires as the long barrel
of a musket appears. With another expletive he goes into his room. Jamie and
Carstairs disarm their captors as more resistance fighters enter.)  
JAMIE: Russell! The Doctor, what happened to him?  
RUSSELL: I don't know. We've just attacked the front of the building.  
JAMIE: Doctor! I thought they'd shot you!  
DOCTOR: Fortunately, Zoe arrived in time. Where's General Smythe?  
CARSTAIRS: He's in there.  
DOCTOR: What? But he'll be calling for help. You've got to stop him!  
RUSSELL: Quick, lads. Over here!

**[Smythe's room]**

SMYTHE: It's the resistance. They're attacking in force. You must send help!  
WAR CHIEF [on monitor: Did you recover the machine?  
SMYTHE: I haven't had a chance. You must send help!  
WAR CHIEF [on monitor]: New master circuit rods for the travel machines are
being prepared.  
SMYTHE: You must send help now!  
WAR CHIEF [on monitor]: Smythe, deactivate the area control.

**[British command post]**

(The fighters have failed to break down the door to Smythe's room.)  
RUSSELL: Right lads, stand back.

**[Smythe's room]**

WAR CHIEF [on monitor]: Deactivate the area control. Deactivate the area
control. Deactivate the area control!  
(Smythe removes the cover from the fireplace to reveal a computer. He is just
about to pull out some units when Russell bursts in. They exchange shots and
Smythe dies.)  
RUSSELL: Quick, Doctor, in here. Look. I think he was trying to destroy it.  
DOCTOR: Why would he want to do that?

**[War room]**

(Zoe turns off the monitor.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: They have taken over the Chateau.  
WAR CHIEF: And the Doctor is still alive. Smythe was a fool. He deserved to
die.  
WAR LORD: The Doctor has the processing machine. Does he have the knowledge
and the ability to use it?  
WAR CHIEF: Yes. I think he has.  
WAR LORD: Then the situation's urgent, isn't it? Fortunately, they're in a
very vulnerable position now. If they've made a mass attack then all their
forces are concentrated in one position, the chateau.  
SECURITY CHIEF: This time we must use the guards.  
WAR CHIEF: No, we will invalidate the experiment. If they are concentrated in
this one place, it would be simple enough to wipe them out with an artillery
barrage.  
WAR LORD: Simple, but just as foolish as using the security guards. A violent
attack on the Chateau would almost certainly destroy the control units there.
The time zone barriers would disappear. No, use the conventional forces. Could
be quite amusing. A mass attack on the chateau. A pincer movement with our
little band of heroes caught in it's jaws.

**[Smythe's room]**

ZOE: What do you make of it, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I'm not sure, Zoe. I think they've got something to do with the time
zone barriers.  
JAMIE: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Huh?  
JAMIE: There's troops moving in from all sides.  
DOCTOR: Oh no! Ohm my word, How many resistance did you bring?  
ZOE: Well, not enough to stand up against an army. Hadn't we better try and
get away?  
JAMIE: Look, it's too late for that. We're surrounded.

**[British command post]**

CARSTAIRS: We could try and break out through here. Some of us might get away.  
RUSSELL: Not a chance. We'd be caught between two armies.  
CARSTAIRS: Yeah.  
DOCTOR: Mister Russell, how long can you hold on here?  
RUSSELL: Well, not long, Doctor. Our forward position's about to fall back
already.  
DOCTOR: Well, you must hold on as long as you can. I think I've got the
answer. You see, we have to have a safe base from which to fight these people.
I must go and get on with my work.  
RUSSELL: What does he mean? What's he up to?  
CARSTAIRS: I don't know, But we'll do as he says and stick it out here for as
long as we can.  
RUSSELL: That won't be long, sir. Listen to that lot.  
CARSTAIRS: Yeah.

**[Smythe's room]**

DOCTOR: Give some help, Zoe. I want to dismantle this.  
ZOE: What for?  
DOCTOR: To find out how it works, of course. Don't ask questions, just do what
I say.  
JAMIE: Well, what can I do?  
DOCTOR: You go and ask. You go and help Mister Russell.  
JAMIE: Right.  
(Jamie leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Now then.  
(The Doctor removes a circuit pack and starts to take it apart with sonic
screwdriver.)

**[War room]**

WAR CHIEF: British troops are advancing from here and here, converging with
French troops advancing from here. Germans are advancing from this side
together with the Austro-Hungarians.  
SECURITY CHIEF: It is taking longer than it should. These resistance people
are putting up a good fight.  
WAR CHIEF: They will be crushed.  
SECURITY CHIEF: They have escaped before. They could do it again.  
WAR CHIEF: Not this time. I am in control.  
SECURITY CHIEF: And the Doctor? Will he die with the rest?  
WAR CHIEF: Why shouldn't he?  
SECURITY CHIEF: He seems to have a charmed life.  
WAR CHIEF: Only when you have a hand in his fate. This Doctor will die.

**[British command post]**

(Behind a barricade of furniture, the resistance are exchanging fire with the
troops outside.)  
JAMIE: It's no good.  
RUSSELL: This is only the vanguard. We know there's more of them to come.
Grenade!  
JAMIE: Look out!  
(Russell pulls the French soldier into the room through the French windows.
Jamie throws the grenade back outside.)  
JAMIE: Duck!  
CARSTAIRS: It's no good, Russell. We must get away from here.

**[Smythe's room]**

CARSTAIRS: Doctor, you and Zoe must try and get away from here.  
DOCTOR: No, I don't think that will be necessary.  
CARSTAIRS: But Doctor  
DOCTOR: Shall we try it, Zoe? Right, here we go.  
(The Doctor turns a knob at the bottom of the computer.)  
CARSTAIRS: Doctor, now what?  
DOCTOR: Shush! Listen.  
(No more gunfire.)  
CARSTAIRS: Stopped. It's stopped.

**[British command post]**

CARSTAIRS: Not a sound.  
RUSSELL: Some sort of trick.  
DOCTOR: No, Mister Russell, look out of the window.  
JAMIE: Aye, a mist.  
DOCTOR: Yes. I've set up a time zone barrier all round the chateau.  
RUSSELL: So none of the processed people will be able to get at us.  
DOCTOR: Exactly, but your people can come and go just as you please. At last
we've got a safe base from which to fight them! We can carry out the next step
in complete safety.  
CARSTAIRS: What next step, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Is this one of yours, Mister Russell?  
RUSSELL: No, Doctor. I pulled him through the window.  
DOCTOR: He's just the man we need.

**[War room]**

Ã©SECURITY CHIEF: So much for your armies of processed humans.  
WAR CHIEF: Smythe should have destroyed the machine.  
SECURITY CHIEF: We should have sent in my security guards.  
WAR CHIEF: And ruin the entire experiment?  
WAR LORD: The Security Chief is right. You have failed. And your leadership of
the security forces has hardly been spectacularly successful. I will take
charge of the whole situation. Now listen carefully, this is what I plan to
do.

**[British command post]**

(The French soldier is being de-processed.)  
DOCTOR: I think that will do, Jamie.  
(The machine stops and Jamie, who is holding it, backs away from the French
soldier.)  
DU PONT: Qui Ã©tes-vous? Qu'est-ce qui se passe?  
DOCTOR: I think it's worked.  
CARSTAIRS: He seems pretty confused. Est-ce que vous voyez Ã§a?  
DU PONT: Oui, je me vois bien. Vous n'Ã©tes pas les bosches?  
CARSTAIRS: I think it has worked, Doctor. At least he can see we're not
Germans.  
DOCTOR: Oh dear. I wonder whether he's completely back to normal?  
DU PONT: Je ne comprends rien. Qui Ã©tes vous? Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici
dans le chÃ¢teau?  
CARSTAIRS: I think he's all right. He just wants to know what we're doing
here. Er, Nous sommes le, le, le, resistance. Resistance? Do you speak
English?  
DU PONT: English? You English?  
RUSSELL: We're all sorts here, lad.  
DU PONT: Je ne comprends pas.  
CARSTAIRS: Nous combattons le. Er, sorry, my French isn't up to it.  
DOCTOR: Look, try. Try to explain to him what's been happening.  
CARSTAIRS: Venez ici, monsieur.  
RUSSELL: So you bring people back to normal with that thing?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes. Everyone we capture we can convert to our side. You'll
soon have all the men you need.  
RUSSELL: Yes, but if you're going to do them all one by one, it'll take until
doomsday.  
DOCTOR: Look, Mister Russell, I am doing my best! If you can capture some more
equipment I might be able to rig up something that will do dozens at a time.  
RUSSELL: Well, now you're talking.  
(The sound of a SIDRAT materialising fills the room.)  
RUSSELL: One of those machines. Quick lads, in here!  
(Guards come out of the SIDRAT in Smythe's room and take out the soldiers.
Then they advance into the main room where the rest of the resistance have
turned their barricade to face the door. The Security Chief is behind them.
The Doctor breaks cover to try and grab the processing machine.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: Stop! Take him!  
(A guard takes the Doctor into Smythe's room.)  
JAMIE: Don't shoot, you might hit the Doctor!  
(The Doctor is pushed into the SIDRAT followed the Security Chief carrying the
machine, then the other guard. It dematerialises.)

__**Episode Eight**__

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

(The SIDRAT materialises and a guard, the Security Chief carrying the machine,
and the Doctor comes out to face a phalanx of armed guards.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you.  
(The Doctor is taken away.)

**[Smythe's room]**

CARSTAIRS: We should have been prepared for it.  
JAMIE: It's no good talking about what we should have done. Zoe, can you work
that stuff and get another one of those things to arrive here?  
RUSSELL: Not on your life! You call one of those things, it'll be full of
guards. They may have sent one anyway.  
CARSTAIRS: Sergeant? You got any explosives?  
RUSSELL: Lots of dynamite, sir.  
CARSTAIRS: Right, we'll put some here, where the thing lands.  
ZOE: But if you blow this place up, you'll destroy the time barrier equipment,
and then their troops will be able to get in.  
RUSSELL: Yes, she's right. But we can keep the place guarded. You, get a
machine gun and set it up in here. Right, come on.  
JAMIE: That's all very well, but it's not going to get the Doctor back, is it.

**[War room]**

SECURITY CHIEF: The prisoner is in the security room awaiting interrogation.  
WAR LORD: Good. A very successful venture. Congratulations.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Thank you.  
WAR LORD: Give it to the scientist. He will return to the home planet and have
it mass produced.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Very well.  
(The Security Chief leaves with the mind-washing machine.)  
WAR CHIEF: The interrogation of that resistance leader might prove difficult.  
WAR LORD: Why?  
WAR CHIEF: He is obviously a man of substantial intellect. He will need
special treatment.  
WAR LORD: Then you must see he gets it, mustn't you?  
WAR CHIEF: I will.

**[Security section]**

(The Security Chief is using his mind-reading machine on the Doctor.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: Answer me. You must answer. Admit that the War Chief sent you
here. You are both of the same race. Your arrival here is part of a plot to
betray us to the Time Lords. Answer!  
(The Doctor sits still so the Chief turns up the intensity.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: You will answer me now or I will destroy your mind totally!

**[Smythe's room]**

(Russell and two Americans set up a machine gun.)  
RUSSELL: Right, lads. Now see that this place is guarded at all times.

**[British command post]**

RUSSELL: Machine gun set up, sir.  
CARSTAIRS: Fine.  
JAMIE: Aye, maybe now you'll do something about getting the Doctor back?  
RUSSELL: I've got more than your friend the Doctor to worry about, lad.  
JAMIE: Now look, we can't just leave him, you know.  
RUSSELL: If there was any way of helping him, I would.  
ZOE: We must carry out the Doctor's plan, that's the best way we can help him.  
CARSTAIRS: How far did you two get to contacting the other resistance groups?  
RUSSELL: Not very far, sir. The attack on this place got in the way.  
CARSTAIRS: Yeah.  
ZOE: We sent out guards to contact the other resistance groups, the ones we
couldn't reach.  
RUSSELL: Can you remember their names?  
ZOE: Yes. There's Marcus Octavius from the Roman Zone, Arturo Villar from the
Mexican Civil War Zone, Ivan Petrov from the Crimean war Zone.  
RUSSELL: Yes. All right, all right, I believe you.  
ZOE: And I can remember all the locations of all their camps, too.  
RUSSELL: Arturo Villar. Now he's the one we've got to convince.  
JAMIE: Arturo Villar? Well, what's so special about him?  
RUSSELL: He's got one of the biggest resistance groups I know about. Bandits,
most of them.  
(A SIDRAT is materialising.)

**[Smythe's room]**

RUSSELL: Right, lads. Now don't fire until the door opens.  
(The door opens and a guard comes out.)  
RUSSELL: Fire!  
(The machine gun is aimed directly at the opening, but the guard gets back in
safely and the door closes.)  
RUSSELL: Hold it!  
(A door opens again and the gunners are felled by a weapon. Russell manages to
get out of the way in time. Carstairs enters.)  
RUSSELL: Get back!  
(Russell takes the machine gun but Carstairs goes to the side of the SIDRAT
and tosses a grenade in through the open door. BOOM. The SIDRAT dematerialises
with smoke still curling from it.)  
RUSSELL: Well, they won't try that again in a hurry.  
CARSTAIRS: Soldier, get him out of here. Sergeant, get another machine gunner.

**[British command post]**

JAMIE: What happened?  
RUSSELL: It's all right, panic's over. Zoe, you'd better get a hurry with
those resistance names, if you would.  
ZOE: Right.  
JAMIE: What're you going to do then?  
RUSSELL: We've got to round them all up. Get them here for a meeting.  
JAMIE: Oh, let's go then.  
RUSSELL: Not you, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Eh?  
RUSSELL: Someone's got to be in charge here.  
JAMIE: Me?  
RUSSELL: Yes, lad. You.

**[Security section]**

(The interrogation is getting nowhere.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: Admit it, the War Chief sent for you. At this volume your mind
will only last for fifteen minutes. Thirty if you are lucky. Now, admit that
the War Chief sent for you!  
WAR CHIEF: Are you trying to kill him?  
(Security Chief turns off the probe and the Doctor relaxes.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: I am trying to get the truth out of him.  
WAR CHIEF: You'll never make him talk that way.  
SECURITY CHIEF: You are very sure.  
WAR CHIEF: He is one of my own race. Your truth machine cannot work on us if
we choose to resist.  
SECURITY CHIEF: You admit it then. You do know him.  
WAR CHIEF: Of course I do. And only I can deal with him. Release him.  
SECURITY CHIEF: He is my prisoner.  
WAR CHIEF: But I am your superior.  
(The Security Chief releases the Doctor's wrists from the chair.)  
WAR CHIEF: You and I are going to talk alone.  
DOCTOR: I have nothing to say to you.  
WAR CHIEF: We shall see. Guards, take this prisoner to the War Room.  
(The Doctor is taken out.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: You have no right to interrupt my interrogation.  
WAR CHIEF: Your interrogation has been completely unsuccessful. I have methods
of my own.  
(The War Chief leaves. The Security Chief goes over to his control desk.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: I want to speak to the War Lord on the top security channel.

**[War room]**

WAR CHIEF: See I am not interrupted. You also, outside.  
(All the technicians leave.)  
WAR CHIEF: You may have changed your appearance, but I know who you are.  
DOCTOR: Oh, do you?  
WAR CHIEF: Your machine is a Tardis. You're too familiar with it's controls to
be a stranger.  
DOCTOR: I had every right to leave.  
WAR CHIEF: Stealing a Tardis? Oh, I'm not criticising you. We are two of a
kind.  
DOCTOR: We most certainly are not!  
WAR CHIEF: We were both Time Lords and we both decided to leave our race.  
DOCTOR: I had reasons of my own.  
WAR CHIEF: Just as I had.  
DOCTOR: Your reasons are only too obvious. Power!  
WAR CHIEF: How much have you learnt of our plans?  
DOCTOR: I know that you've been kidnapping soldiers from the Earth from
various times in it's history and bringing them here to kill one another.  
WAR CHIEF: But do you realise our ultimate objectives?  
DOCTOR: No objective can justify such slaughter.  
WAR CHIEF: The war games on this planet are simply the means to an end. The
aliens intend to conquer the entire galaxy. A thousand inhabited worlds.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but why choose the people of the Earth?  
WAR CHIEF: They are the most suitable recruits for our armies. Man is the most
vicious species of all.  
DOCTOR: Well, that simply isn't true.  
WAR CHIEF: Consider their history. For a half a million years they have been
systematically killing each other. Now we can turn this savagery to some
purpose. We can bring peace to the galaxy, and you can help. You see, I'm not
the cold-hearted villain you suppose me to be. My motives are purely peaceful.

**[British command post]**

(Zoe has fallen asleep at the desk so Jamie puts a coat over her shoulders and
leaves quietly. The armed guards are also dozing off. Then one gets hit over
the head and the other has a rifle barrel pushed in his chest.)  
ZOE: Jamie? What?  
VILLAR: You don't speak, make a noise, understand? This man Russell, where is
he?  
ZOE: Who are you?  
VILLAR: Arturo Villar!  
ZOE: Well, why didn't you tell us you were coming?  
VILLAR: Traps are for animals to fall into. Hey, get the men Russell, and no
tricks. My men surround this place.  
ZOE: Well, I think you might at least have a  
VILLAR: Women should never think. For such a little woman your mouth is too
big. Get Russell.

**[Smythe's room]**

(Jamie is asleep on the cot bed.)  
ZOE: Jamie?  
JAMIE: Has something happened?  
ZOE: I'll say it has. Arturo Villar's arrived with all his bandits, and
they've surrounded the headquarters.  
JAMIE: Has he now? I'll soon sort him out.  
ZOE: Oh Jamie, no! They'd shoot you as soon as look at you.  
JAMIE: Eh? I thought he was supposed to be on our side?  
ZOE: Well, he is. Well, I mean, he will be if we can persuade him to join us.  
JAMIE: Well, didn't you explain to him?  
ZOE: Yes, I tried, but he wouldn't listen. He's got rather primitive ideas
about women knowing their place.  
JAMIE: Has he now? Oh, sounds a nice chap.  
ZOE: Jamie, this is no laughing matter. We've got to persuade him to stay here
until Russell gets back.  
JAMIE: Well look, if he won't listen to you, then he's not going to  
ZOE: No, not to me, but. Quickly over here, I've got an idea.  
JAMIE: Zoe, what are you doing?  
ZOE: Jamie, come on!

**[British command post]**

(Villar has helped himself to food.)  
VILLAR: Well? Where is this Russell?  
ZOE: He's not here.  
VILLAR: Then I go.  
ZOE: Wait! I think perhaps you'd better meet our other leader.  
VILLAR: Who is this?  
ZOE: Jamie! Our leader, James Robert McCrimmon!  
(Wearing an officer's cap and with two ammo belts across his chest, Jamie
swaggers in.)  
VILLAR: Salut!  
JAMIE: Oh, how do you do.  
VILLAR: So, you call everyone together for a meeting, huh? Why? Maybe you plan
to take over my territory, huh?  
JAMIE: Oh, no, no. No, it's nothing like that, no.  
ZOE: Unity is strength.  
JAMIE: Unity is strength.  
VILLAR: And when you have this strength, what do you do with it?  
JAMIE: Ah, do with it. Aye.  
ZOE: We attack the aliens that brought everybody here.  
JAMIE: We attack them all together in force!  
VILLAR: You bring all the resistance together in one place, you know what
happens? We rob and kill each other!  
ZOE: You'll never win unless you work together. It's the only way.  
VILLAR: Why do you let a woman speak for you?  
JAMIE: Well, why not? Only if she's right, of course.  
ZOE: And I am.  
VILLAR: We always fight in small groups, far apart. That's why they don't
catch us.  
JAMIE: Aye, and that's why you're getting nowhere.  
VILLAR: We are free men. We do anything we want to.  
ZOE: You are hunted fugitives and they'll pick you off one by one unless you
join with us. It's the only way you'll ever get home.  
VILLAR: Home? No one can get away from this place.  
ZOE: Oh, but you can.  
VILLAR: How?  
ZOE: The same way you all came here. But first we've got to defeat the people
that run everything. They have a stronghold.  
VILLAR: I have heard. It is impossible to get in there.  
ZOE: Well, we have been there, and if we can get a big enough army together, I
can take you all there.  
VILLAR: All right, I stay for this meeting. But then we see.

**[War room]**

WAR CHIEF: We have soldiers from most of the major wars in the planet Earth.
The first World War, the war between Russia and Japan of 1905, Thirty years
war.  
DOCTOR: But why make them kill each other?  
WAR CHIEF: How else can we find the most disciplined and courageous fighters?  
DOCTOR: You have given these aliens our science and our knowledge to carry out
this disgusting plan.  
WAR CHIEF: We are going to bring a new order to the galaxy, one United
Galactic Empire.  
DOCTOR: An empire of slaves, with you as one of it's rulers.  
WAR CHIEF: Doctor, this is also a matter of your own survival. Unless I can
convince the War Lord that you will help us  
(Alarms sound, the War Lord and Security Chief enter with guards.)  
WAR LORD: What is the prisoner doing here?  
WAR CHIEF: I am interrogating him.  
WAR LORD: You interrogate without guards?  
WAR CHIEF: I know this man. He is a fugitive from the Time Lords.  
SECURITY CHIEF: As you are.  
WAR CHIEF: That's right, as I am.  
WAR LORD: Did you bring him here?  
WAR CHIEF: No, he arrived by chance.  
WAR LORD: Did the Time Lords send you?  
DOCTOR: No.  
WAR LORD: Have you informed them?  
WAR CHIEF: He dare not. That would betray him.  
SECURITY CHIEF: He has allied himself with the resistance and has organised
them against us. He must die.  
WAR CHIEF: No! He has agreed to help us destroy the resistance. He will
cooperate. He has no alternative.  
SECURITY CHIEF: He should be killed now. We cannot trust him.  
WAR LORD: If he helps us destroy the resistance. If. His life will be spared.  
SECURITY CHIEF: War Lord.  
WAR CHIEF: I have decided. (to War Chief) I hold you responsible for the
success of the plan. Failure will mean death, to both of you.  
(The War Lord, Security Chief and guards leave.)  
DOCTOR: I never promised to help you!  
WAR CHIEF: But you will. You have no alternative.  
DOCTOR: But to help people like that to conquer the galaxy?  
WAR CHIEF: Not people like that, people like us. I intend to take over as
Supreme Galactic Ruler. You can help me to rule, if you will cooperate.

**[British command post]**

VILLAR: I tell you it's crazy, it'll never work!  
RUSSELL: We don't know till we've tried it. We've never had all the resistance
groups together before.  
VILLAR: You bring everyone together in one place, you know what happens? The
enemy will go pow! We are all killed.  
PETROV: What he says makes sense. Alone, we annoy them a little, together, we
wipe them out.  
JAMIE: That's exactly what the Doctor says.  
CARSTAIRS: Look, we should get together a large body of men. Armed,
disciplined. And then, and only then can we strike at their headquarters.  
VILLAR: How do we get there?  
ZOE: We use one of their own space time machines.  
VILLAR: Ah, these little boxes you talk about, holding thousands of men. Fairy
stories!  
PETROV: I have seen one. I have seen soldiers come out of them. Whole
regiments.  
CARSTAIRS: You see, SeÃ±or Villar? We're not talking nonsense.  
VILLAR: These magic boxes. Where do we get one?  
ZOE: They have certain landing points in each time zone. That room over there,
that's one of them.  
VILLAR: How you get a whole army in here? The place is surrounded. It's hard
enough for one man at a time to get in.  
CARSTAIRS: Yes, quite right. We must use one of the other places.  
JAMIE: Well, what about that American barn where we met Mister Russell?  
CARSTAIRS: Yes, that's er, that's here. (points to map) Is that all right for
everybody?  
PETROV: Khorosho! I know that place. Much forest, easy to hide men.  
CARSTAIRS: Well, we're agreed then. You all gather your groups here, and we
make a concerted attack on the enemy.  
VILLAR: And what if he make a concerted attack on us?  
CARSTAIRS: Oh, he's going to be far too busy to do that.  
(A motley pair of resistance fighters sneak into a Roman tent and smash its
communications unit.)

**[War room]**

(Zone One alarm sounds.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: Failure of communications unit in Roman Zone. Send a
technicians to repair. And send a guard!

**[British command post]**

CARSTAIRS: Right. Good. Right, carry on. That's the first one, Roman Zone.
Control unit's been completely destroyed.  
ZOE: I wonder if it'll work?  
CARSTAIRS: Oh, it'll work all right. Next one's due in the Crimean War Zone.
It's due about now.  
(The poor sentry gets jumped and dragged away while a Mexican takes dynamite
into the store room. He comes out again unrolling the fuse wire which his
Redcoat companion fastens to the detonator and then presses the plunger.
KaBOOM!)

**[War room]**

SECURITY CHIEF: Another communications failure. Crimean War Zone. Send a squad
of guards!

**[British command post]**

RUSSELL: (answers telephone.) Hello. Russell.  
CARSTAIRS: (on telephone) Good. Excellent. Yes, thank you very much.  
RUSSELL: I see.  
CARSTAIRS: Roman Zone. A technician and guard have arrived.  
ZOE: So that's the Roman Zone then.  
JAMIE: Technician and guard? That's only two men.  
CARSTAIRS: They're not really worried yet.  
RUSSELL: They are now. They've just sent a squad of guards to the Crimean War
Zone.  
ZOE: Oh, good. That's a more like it.  
CARSTAIRS: By the time we've finished with them, there won't be a guard left
in the place.  
(Time passes, and flags are put on the map for Russo-Japanese war and 30 years
war. Zoe takes a call.)  
ZOE: Good! Jamie, Boer War Zone.  
CARSTAIRS: English Civil War Zone.  
RUSSELL: Yes, fine. Peninsular War Zone, they've sent ten guards there.  
CARSTAIRS: Right, well, that seems to be about it. Right, time for phase two.
Villar should be at the barn by now. Carry on, Sergeant.  
RUSSELL: Sir.  
(Carstairs leaves.)  
RUSSELL: Okay, we'll leave one by one and spread out.

**[Barn]**

(A soldier rushes in and goes straight to the video screen. He gets shot. A
Mexican draws his pistol to shoot out the screen.)  
VILLAR: No, not yet. Now we wait.

**[War room]**

SECURITY CHIEF: It is a clear pattern. Simultaneous attacks in all time zones.  
WAR CHIEF: And you've sent guards to every attack?  
SECURITY CHIEF: There are now very few left to send.  
WAR CHIEF: That's exactly what they wanted. Have any of the guards returned?  
SECURITY CHIEF: No.  
WAR CHIEF: So you've left the base weakened for a possible mass attack.  
WAR LORD: Is that true?  
SECURITY CHIEF: I know where their attack is coming from. A communications
unit was activated in the American Civil War Zone.  
WAR LORD: And how do you propose to deal with them, with your guards scattered
all over the War Zones?  
SECURITY CHIEF: The neutron bomb.  
WAR CHIEF: That would wipe out the processed humans. We would have to evacuate
the planet.  
WAR LORD: The resistance army must be crushed once and for all.  
SECURITY CHIEF: So we shall use the neutron bomb?  
WAR LORD: No, we shall attempt to be rather more subtle than that, (to the
Doctor) which will give you an ideal opportunity to prove your loyalty and
save your life.

**[Barn]**

CARSTAIRS: Are all the resistance groups here, Sergeant?  
RUSSELL: Yes, sir.  
VILLAR: They are hidden in the woods. So here we all are in one place, a nice
big target.  
RUSSELL: Don't worry, it won't be for long. Soon as we smash that thing,
they'll send one of their machines and we'll take it.  
CARSTAIRS: Right, stand back.  
(Carstairs is about to shoot out the video screen when a familiar face appears
on it.)  
JAMIE: Wait a minute!  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Jamie? Zoe?  
ZOE: Oh Doctor, where are you? Are you all right?  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Is Mister Russell there?  
JAMIE: Aye, all the resistance leaders are with us.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Oh, good. Now there's no time to be lost. I think I can
send you one of their space time machines. I've managed to gain control of
their transportation system.  
ZOE: We've got a whole army here, Doctor. We could take over the entire base.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Oh, no, no. All I need is a party of picked men. There's
got quite a lot to organise. I have to talk to the leaders.  
JAMIE: But Doctor, would it not be better if we brought a gang with us?  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Jamie, please don't argue. I will send the transportation
now.  
(Transmission ends.)  
VILLAR: I don't like this. It could be a trap.  
(A SIDRAT materialises.)  
CARSTAIRS: Don't panic! There's nothing to worry about. Everybody take cover
just in case there are some guards.  
(The SIDRAT door opens and Carstairs checks inside.)  
CARSTAIRS: It's all right. It's empty.  
RUSSELL: Right, now one of us must stay here to look after those men. Petrov,
it'd better be you.  
PETROV: All right, you are boss.  
VILLAR: Mine is the biggest group. I should stay here in charge.  
RUSSELL: Why? You scared of going into that thing?  
VILLAR: Arturo Villar is afraid of nothing!  
RUSSELL: Right. In you go then.  
VILLAR: I shall lead the way. (Carstairs, Villar, Zoe, Jamie, Russell enter
the SIDRAT followed by Russell and a couple of soldiers. It dematerialises.)

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

(The SIDRAT materialises.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, Carstairs.  
CARSTAIRS: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Zoe.  
ZOE: Oh, Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Jamie.  
JAMIE: Are you all right?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, everything is under control. Now listen, everyone. Just
follow me. We're going to take over the war room!  
(The Doctor leads them two paces into the room then guards appear.)  
DOCTOR: Stand still, don't move! You are completely surrounded!  
ZOE: Doctor!  
WAR CHIEF: Thank you, Doctor. A nice, neat little package for us to dispose
of.

__**Episode Nine**__

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

JAMIE: What's happened?  
RUSSELL: We were idiots to trust you. I'll kill you for this!  
WAR CHIEF: Idle threats, Doctor, have no fear. Guards, disarm them and take
them away.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Take him too.  
WAR CHIEF: No. He is working for us.  
SECURITY CHIEF: What further use is he?  
WAR CHIEF: He has proved his loyalty by helping us, and he has great knowledge
of time travel mechanics.  
SECURITY CHIEF: The War Lord shall decide. Take these prisoners to the
processing room. Hold them there under strict guard until further orders.  
CARSTAIRS: Get off!  
(The prisoners are hustled away.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: I shall be with the War Lord.  
(Security Chief leaves.)  
WAR CHIEF: Don't worry, Doctor. The War Lord will welcome your loyalty and
assistance.  
DOCTOR: Well, I hope so, but you know, I find it hard to understand why you
need me.  
WAR CHIEF: We need each other.  
DOCTOR: It's something to do with the Tardis travel machines, isn't it?  
WAR CHIEF: Shall we join the War Lord? It doesn't do to keep him waiting.  
DOCTOR: I must congratulate you on them, you know. You're achieved a
remarkable degree of control.  
WAR CHIEF: Simply a variation on the old models.  
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear fellow, you're too modest. Dimensional flexibility? Remote
control? In my day these things were impossible to achieve without shortening
the life of the time control units.  
WAR CHIEF: There have been many advances made in space time technology.  
DOCTOR: Yes, there must have been. That particular problem is impossible to
solve. How did you solve it?  
WAR CHIEF: It's not a thing one can explain in a few words. We'll discuss it
later. Now we really should join the War Lord.  
DOCTOR: You haven't solved it, have you? Your machines have a limited life
span. Sooner or later they're going to be useless.  
WAR CHIEF: Very well. Yes, you're right.  
DOCTOR: Now I understand. It's my Tardis that you're after, isn't it?  
WAR CHIEF: Exactly! When we are in control, the machines I have brought with
me will have expired. If we hold the only space time travel machine, we can
rule our galaxy without fear of opposition.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but without me and my Tardis your ambitions are going to be
rather hard to realise, aren't they?  
WAR CHIEF: That's right. And without my influence, these aliens will surely
kill you.

**[Processing room]**

RUSSELL: Well, a fine mess your friend the Doctor got us in, eh? I'll break
his neck when I get my hands on him.  
CARSTAIRS: Oh, I don't believe it.  
JAMIE: Look, he must have had a good reason.  
VILLAR: To have us killed, maybe, to save his own skin. When I get my hands on
him I kill him too!  
JAMIE: Now look, the Doctor wouldn't betray us.  
ZOE: No, of course, he wouldn't! Why did he get us to come here?

**[War room]**

WAR LORD: He seems to have done very well. We have the leaders of the
resistance, and the immediate threat to the war games is over. But your sudden
decision to join us worries me.  
DOCTOR: Well, I like to be on the winning side.  
WAR LORD: Previously you thought the resistance to be the winning side. What
made you change your mind?  
DOCTOR: Well, I hadn't realised how small and weak their groups were compared
with your might and power.  
WAR LORD: You have a silver tongue, just like your friend the War Chief. What
contribution can you make to our plan?  
DOCTOR: Well, your processing machines. I can make them work more effectively.  
WAR LORD: Our scientist is at this moment producing new machines on the home
planet.  
DOCTOR: Ah yes, but that will take time. I can make the old ones work just as
well. Probably better.  
WAR LORD: Very well. You shall have the opportunity to prove your ability. You
will adjust the machines and reprocess your resistance friends.  
DOCTOR: They are no longer my friends. They are our enemies.  
WAR LORD: Of course they are. Take him to the processing room. See he has
every facility.  
(The Doctor and Security Chief leave with guards.)  
WAR LORD: The resistance groups, where are they?  
WAR CHIEF: They are all now concentrated in this one area. I have ordered the
conventional troops to move in on them.  
WAR LORD: Good. When the situation returns to normal order all the security
guards to return to the control centre. All control points on the planet are
to be repaired, and the war games recommenced.  
WAR CHIEF: Are you returning to the home planet?  
WAR LORD: No. I'm waiting until the emergency is over. You will inform me
immediately if there's any change in the situation.

**[Processing room]**

ZOE: What are they making us wait here for?  
CARSTAIRS: Probably going to reprocess us again.  
JAMIE: Eh?  
CARSTAIRS: Brainwash us, send us back to fight.  
RUSSELL: No, I doubt it. They know their processing machines don't work on us.  
VILLAR: They will shoot us. What else do you do with prisoners?  
SECURITY CHIEF: Your friend the Doctor has a better idea. He is going to
adjust the machines and re-process you himself.  
JAMIE: He wouldn't do that!  
ZOE: Doctor, you can't!  
RUSSELL: You just try it!  
SECURITY CHIEF: I don't think they like you. Unfortunately I cannot spare any
of my guards to protect you, so you will have to fend for yourself.  
DOCTOR: What? But you  
(The Security Chief leaves with the guards.)  
RUSSELL: Well, well, well. It seems your new friends don't like you either.  
VILLAR: Leave him to me. I kill him first.  
DOCTOR: No. No! Don't come any closer, no!

**[War room]**

SECURITY CHIEF: How is the battle progressing?  
WAR CHIEF: The resistance group were all concentrated in this one area. We
have them completely encircled.  
SECURITY CHIEF: And now you will destroy them?  
WAR CHIEF: Of course. They are falling into disorder, naturally enough since
we have their leaders here. Has the Doctor started processing them?  
SECURITY CHIEF: Not yet.  
WAR CHIEF: Why not?  
SECURITY CHIEF: Where is the War Lord?  
WAR CHIEF: You did take the Doctor to the processing room?  
SECURITY CHIEF: Of course.  
WAR CHIEF: I don't trust you.  
SECURITY CHIEF: The feeling is mutual.  
(The War Chief leaves.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: Play back the recordings.

**[Processing room]**

(The Doctor is being mobbed.)  
DOCTOR: Oh no, leave me alone!  
CARSTAIRS: Leave him be!  
JAMIE: Now look! Just give him a chance to speak!  
RUSSELL: Yes, we listened to him once before and look where it got us. He led
us into a trap!  
DOCTOR: They were going to drop a neutron bomb! You'd all be dead now, and all
of your resistance friends with you, if it wasn't for me.  
VILLAR: He's lying.  
RUSSELL: You did a deal to save your own neck.  
VILLAR: But your deal didn't do you no good. They turn you over to us and now
we kill you.  
CARSTAIRS: No, you can't just murder him.  
VILLAR: Is not murder, is execution.  
CARSTAIRS: Have you got any explanation for your conduct?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I am trying to save your lives! If you do exactly as I tell
you'll be all right.  
VILLAR: We don't listen to your lies no more.  
(Villar gets away from Carstairs and starts choking the Doctor. The War Chief
and his guards break it up.)  
WAR CHIEF: I'm sorry, Doctor. There seems to have been some kind of
misunderstanding.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and it was very nearly fatal.

**[War room]**

WAR CHIEF [OC]: Doctor, this is also a matter of your own survival. Unless I
can convince the War Lord that you will help us  
SECURITY CHIEF: Stop! Wind further on. Now! Try there.  
WAR LORD [OC]: Responsible for the success of the plan. Failure will mean
death. For both of you.  
DOCTOR [OC]: I never promised to help you!  
WAR CHIEF [OC]: But you will. You have no alternative.  
DOCTOR [OC]: To help people like that gain control of the galaxy?  
WAR CHIEF [OC]: Not people like that, people like us. I will take over as
Supreme Galactic Ruler. You can help me rule, if you will cooperate.  
SECURITY CHIEF: Enough! I knew it.

**[Processing room]**

(Jamie is in the brainwashing machine.)  
WAR CHIEF: Are you sure this new process will be completely effective?  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, quite sure. I think that will do. There we are. Now then, when
this young man comes to, he will believe himself to be fighting the English
Redcoats in 1745. Now get up!  
JAMIE: Eh? Oh.  
DOCTOR: What is your name?  
JAMIE: Eh?  
DOCTOR: Your name.  
JAMIE: Ah, James Robert McCrimmon.  
DOCTOR: Do you know where you are?  
JAMIE: Er well, I  
DOCTOR: You are in my castle. I am the McCrimmon of McCrimmon, your hereditary
Chieftain.  
JAMIE: Yes, of course. You're the Chieftain. Who's that?  
DOCTOR: Well, that is a friendly chieftain. You will obey his orders as you
will mine.  
JAMIE: Oh aye, I'll obey you.  
DOCTOR: There you are, you see? Complete loyalty and devotion. I can do the
same with all the other resistance people that you capture.  
WAR CHIEF: Excellent. Continue with the others. If you can successfully
process characters like these, you will have made an immense contribution.  
(The War Chief leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Bring the girl!  
ZOE: Oh, leave me alone. Don't!  
(The guards bring Zoe, and Jamie helps sit her down.)  
JAMIE: Look, do as you're told.  
DOCTOR: You will obey us. It is for your own good. (wink)

**[War room]**

WAR CHIEF: What a stupid fool you are. You deliberately disobeyed the War
Lord's orders. Arrest him. Arrest him!  
SECURITY CHIEF: You are no longer in command.  
WAR CHIEF [OC]: I will take over as Supreme Galactic Ruler. You can help me
rule, if you will cooperate.  
SECURITY CHIEF: I had all discussion that took place between you and the
Doctor recorded. What a stupid fool you are. Guards, take him to the security
bay! Collect his accomplice, the Doctor, on the way. If they offer any
resistance, shoot them both!

**[Processing room]**

(Villar has been processed.)  
DOCTOR: There we are. Now then, sit up, sit up! Now then, you are in la
Castille de la Cruz de San Antonio de la Frada Forma, in Mexico.  
VILLAR: Eh? Are you crazy? You machine is no good! Villar is too strong for
you!  
(Villar starts throttling the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: Stop! Get him off me!  
(Carstairs and the others tackle the guards who come to his aid, then Jamie
gets Villar off the Doctor.)  
JAMIE: Can you not pretend like the rest of us, you great loon?  
VILLAR: Is all a trick?  
JAMIE: Aye.  
VILLAR: You fix the machine so she don't work?  
DOCTOR: Yes. I fix her, and you nearly fixed me.  
VILLAR: And you only pretend to be loco?  
JAMIE: Exactly!  
RUSSELL: But Doctor, why did you get us here at all?  
DOCTOR: They were going to drop the neutron bomb. You were better alive here
than dead out there.  
CARSTAIRS: Zoe, watch the door, will you?  
ZOE: Right.  
CARSTAIRS: Doctor, now we're here, surely we can take over?  
RUSSELL: It depends upon how many of those guards they've got.  
CARSTAIRS: Ah, but we've been drawing them out to the Time Zones.  
DOCTOR: Yes, very successfully from what I hear.  
ZOE: Doctor, somebody's coming. Three of them are heading this way.  
(The War Chief is marched in under guard. The fighters take out the guards.)  
DOCTOR: Don't harm him. We may need him.  
WAR CHIEF: It seems my trust in you was a little misplaced.  
DOCTOR: Did you really think I'd take part in your disgusting, stealing
scheme?  
WAR CHIEF: Why not? You must have been a little tempted by the thought of
being the ruler of an entire galaxy.  
VILLAR: All this talk! When we fight?  
RUSSELL: We haven't got anything to fight with. We've no guns.  
CARSTAIRS: We've got those alien guns if we can work out how to use them.  
VILLAR: I no trust those things. I need my guns, they good guns, never miss.  
RUSSELL: Well, he knows where they're stored.  
WAR CHIEF: I might.  
RUSSELL: You'd better, because I'm  
DOCTOR: I'm sure that the War Chief is going to cooperate. He's going to help
us gain control of the War Room.  
WAR CHIEF: That may not be so easy. You see, our little arrangement had been
discovered. I was under arrest.  
RUSSELL: Oh yes?  
CARSTAIRS: Yes, that could be right. He did come in here under gunpoint.  
WAR CHIEF: But the personnel in the landing bay are not aware of my arrest.
When the security guards return from the Time Zones, you won't stand a chance.
I can stop the arrival of the time machines.  
DOCTOR: I see. Very well, but first you'll take us to the War Room. You're the
only one that can stop the fighting in the Zones.  
VILLAR: Hey, wait a minute! First we get our guns, no?  
DOCTOR: No. I mean, yes. Come along, Jamie, Zoe.

**[War room]**

SECURITY CHIEF: I want a blanket broadcast to all security guards in the War
Zones. This is the Security Chief. The resistance groups are scattered over
the Civil War Zone. They will be dealt with later. All security guards will
now proceed to the nearest control point, there are  
(The resistance rushes in.)  
SECURITY CHIEF: Guards!  
(Two more guards enter, and Villar shoots them.)  
VILLAR: I told you, my guns best!  
SECURITY CHIEF: Emergency alarm!  
(The technician hits the alarm then gets shot. The Security Chief tries to
sneak to a weapons rack, and the War Chief takes him down with one of the
sonic weapons. Jamie and Carstairs point their guns at him.)  
WAR CHIEF: It's all right. It was a personal debt I had to settle.  
(The War Chief hands over the weapon.)  
DOCTOR: Will somebody turn off that hideous noise? I cannot think!  
ZOE: There's one thing I don't understand, Doctor. How are you going to get
all these people back to their own time?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I've been thinking about that.  
WAR CHIEF: You realise that we have very little time now the alarm has been
sounded?  
DOCTOR: Yes. Call off the fighting at once!  
WAR CHIEF: We could just go to the landing bay, order a machine and leave.  
DOCTOR: You could, we can't. The fighting has to be stopped and everyone sent
back to their own times.  
WAR CHIEF: Sent back? How?  
DOCTOR: By your Tardis travel machines, of course.  
WAR CHIEF: I'm afraid that will not be possible. There are only two machines
left with enough life in them.  
DOCTOR: What? But, oh my word, well that's happened rather sooner than I
expected.  
RUSSELL: Doctor, does that mean that you can't do as you promised and get us
all home?  
DOCTOR: Oh, well, yes, I  
WAR CHIEF: You can't.  
DOCTOR: I can still do that.  
WAR CHIEF: You can't, unless. Doctor, you mustn't call them in or it will be
the end of us. They'll show no mercy.  
DOCTOR: You stop the fighting!  
RUSSELL: Do as you're told!  
WAR CHIEF: This is the War Chief to all War Zones. This is a command direct
from the War Lord. All fighting will cease. I repeat, all fighting in the War
Zones will cease. You will stand by for further orders.  
ZOE: What did he mean, Doctor? Who mustn't you call?  
DOCTOR: The only people who can put an end to this whole ghastly business and
send everyone back to their own times. The Time Lords.  
JAMIE: Who are they?  
DOCTOR: They're my own people, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Oh, well, that's all right, then.  
ZOE: But it isn't all right, is it, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: No, it's not, Zoe. But I'm afraid that there's no alternative.  
(The Doctor sits on the floor and puts six plastic squares in a circle in
front of him. Then he closes his eyes and concentrates.)  
JAMIE: What's he doing?  
WAR CHIEF: Don't do it, Doctor. You can't! You know what will happen!  
(The squares form themselves into a cube.)  
JAMIE: Look at that!  
CARSTAIRS: That's fantastic.  
VILLAR: Is magic!  
ZOE: Doctor, are you all right?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoe, I'm all right.  
JAMIE: Doctor, what's that?  
DOCTOR: It's a box, Jamie.  
JAMIE: I know. I can see that.  
DOCTOR: It's a very special sort of box. It now contains all the information
about what's been going on here, and an appeal for help.  
JAMIE: Help? Who from?  
ZOE: The Time Lords?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoe.  
JAMIE: Well, why haven't you asked them for help before?  
DOCTOR: I've never really needed it before, Jamie, but this business of
sending everyone back to their own times is, well, it's too difficult for me.  
(The Doctor puts the cube in his pocket.)  
DOCTOR: Now, come along. The War Chief!  
CARSTAIRS: What?  
DOCTOR: He's gone!  
RUSSELL: What?  
DOCTOR: He must be trying to get away before the Time Lords get here!  
CARSTAIRS: Well, what are we going to do, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: We must go to the landing bay and stop him.

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

(The War Chief runs in and summons a SIDRAT. But before he can get inside he
is stopped by guards.)  
WAR CHIEF: I thought  
WAR LORD: Yes?  
WAR CHIEF: You've arrived just in time. There's been a revolt. The prisoners
have escaped. How many guards do you have?  
WAR LORD: Only the ones you see here.  
WAR CHIEF: Then we must return to the home planet to bring reinforcements.  
WAR LORD: Where is the Security Chief?  
WAR CHIEF: The prisoners have taken over the War Room. They've killed him.  
WAR LORD: No, no, you killed him, but a little too late. I heard the
recording.  
WAR CHIEF: He wanted to stop the War Games. He was a incompetent fool, jealous
of my position. Surely you realise that? He forged that recording you heard.  
(The War Chief runs for the exit but guards block him.)  
WAR CHIEF: He wanted to stop the war games! He tried  
WAR LORD: Kill him!

**[Central area]**

(The War Chief's screams can be heard.)  
CARSTAIRS: Doctor! Doctor, that came from the landing bay!  
DOCTOR: Yes, but they won't be expecting us. Come on.

**[SIDRAT landing bay]**

WAR LORD: Remove the traitor's carcass. We will return to the home planet and
bring back an army to quell this revolt once and for all.  
(The guards take the War Chief's body to one side while the War Lord adjusts
the SIDRAT control panel.)  
VILLAR: Viva el Villar!  
(Villar starts shooting, and the other fighters join in from the other side of
the bay. Jamie goes hand to hand with a remaining guard.)  
VILLAR: Out of the way, I shoot the dog!  
(Carstairs deals with the other surviving guard as Russell helps Jamie. Villar
goes to the War Lord.)  
VILLAR: I kill him too!  
DOCTOR: No, no, that won't be necessary. We'll leave him for the Time Lords to
dispose of.  
RUSSELL: When will they be here, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I'm going to send for them now. And I want you all to stay here and
wait until they come.  
RUSSELL: But what are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: Well, I cannot stay here. Jamie, Zoe, this is where we say goodbye.  
JAMIE: What are you talking about?  
DOCTOR: Well, the Time Lords will return you home.  
ZOE: But why can't we stay with you?  
DOCTOR: Because when I send this box to them, they'll know where I am.  
JAMIE: But I thought they were your people, your friends?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, they are my people, but. Oh, it'd take too long to
explain. I have to go!  
JAMIE: Now look, if you're going to be in trouble, you'll need me to look
after you.  
ZOE: Me, too.  
JAMIE: Aye.  
DOCTOR: But you don't understand! Oh, very well, but don't say I didn't warn
you. Right then, we must return to the 1917 Zone and find the Tardis, and make
good our escape.  
CARSTAIRS: Doctor, can I come back there with you? I'd rather like to try and
find Lady Jennifer.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, very well.  
(The Doctor gets a SIDRAT ready, then sits on the floor and concentrates. The
box vanishes.)  
DOCTOR: Well, goodbye, gentlemen. I'm sorry, but we must rush.  
VILLAR: You leave us?  
RUSSELL: Yes, what about us?  
DOCTOR: The Time Lords will return you home. Now come along.  
VILLAR: No! No one is going anywhere. This Doctor, he cheat us. We rescue him
and now he leave us here to die.  
RUSSELL: Yes, it's only fair, Doctor! If these Time Lords are friends of
yours, why don't you wait for them to arrive?  
DOCTOR: But you don't understand, Mister Russell. I must go. Please!  
VILLAR: You stay here with us, my friend.  
DOCTOR: Look, I am not going to argue. Jamie, Zoe, Carstairs, into the
machine.  
JAMIE: Ah but Doctor, look, he's not joking, you know.  
DOCTOR: For once, Jamie, do as you are told!  
VILLAR: You move and I kill you!  
DOCTOR: Then you will just have to kill me, Mister Villar.  
VILLAR: Well Mister Doctor, that is just what I will do!  
(The Doctor goes into the SIDRAT after Jamie and Zoe. Carstairs and Russell
grab Villar to stop him shooting the Doctor, then Carstairs enters the
SIDRAT.)  
VILLAR: Let me go, I kill him!  
RUSSELL: You can't shoot him in the back, he's done too much for us.  
VILLAR: Ah, the back, the front, what's the difference?  
RUSSELL: It's too late now, anyway.  
(The SIDRAT dematerialises.)  
WAR LORD: Don't worry. When the Time Lords get him, he'll wish you had killed
him.  
(A strange sound fills the room.)  
WAR LORD: They're coming.

**[No Man's Land]**

CARSTAIRS: Fighting's stopped.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, goodbye, Lieutenant.  
JAMIE: Eh?  
DOCTOR: There's the Tardis. We've got to get on.  
CARSTAIRS: Goodbye, Doctor.  
ZOE: Oh, Doctor, wait! Goodbye!  
JAMIE: Bye, Lieutenant.  
CARSTAIRS: Bye.  
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie rush away, and Carstairs waves then vanishes.)  
JAMIE: Hey, he's  
DOCTOR: Come on!  
(The strange sound is here too. Their movements get slower and slower as they
run towards the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: Come on!  
ZOE: What is it?  
DOCTOR: Time Lords! Try harder! We must get away!  
(They are on hands and knees by the time they get to the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: We must get away!  
(The Doctor just manages to put the key in the lock.)

__**Episode Ten**__

**[Outside the Tardis]**

ZOE: What's happening, Doctor? I can hardly move.  
DOCTOR: It's a force field. Concentrate. We may be able to break through it.
Help me with the key. Concentrate!  
(Jamie holds the Doctor's arm up to turn the key and open the Tardis door.)

**[Tardis]**

(They crawl inside.)  
ZOE: It's in here, too.  
JAMIE: Will we get away all right, Doctor?  
(The Doctor reaches the door controls.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, I hope so, Jamie. If I can boost the power enough, the Tardis may
be able to break through the force field.  
(The Tardis dematerialises and they can move at normal speed again.)  
JAMIE: Well, what was happening? Why was it so difficult to move?  
DOCTOR: It was the Time Lords.  
ZOE: But they're your own people, aren't they, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right.  
JAMIE: Why did you run away from them in the first place?  
DOCTOR: What? Well, I was bored.  
ZOE: What do you mean, you were bored?  
DOCTOR: Well, the Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control
our own environment, we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the
secret of space time travel.  
JAMIE: Well what's so wrong in all that?  
DOCTOR: Well we hardly ever use our great powers. We consent simply to observe
and to gather knowledge.  
ZOE: And that wasn't enough for you?  
DOCTOR: No, of course not. With a whole galaxy to explore? Millions of
planets, eons of time, countless civilisations to meet?  
JAMIE: Well, why do they object to you doing all that?  
DOCTOR: Well, It is a fact, Jamie, that I do tend to get involved with things.  
JAMIE: Aye, you can say that again. Whenever there's any trouble, he's in it
right up to his neck.  
ZOE: But you've helped people, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, but that's no excuse in their eyes.  
JAMIE: Well, then what are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: We're going to run away. I've set the controls to take us to a planet
on the outermost fringes of the galaxy.  
JAMIE: Oh, in that case, we'll probably land up right in their laps.  
(The Tardis dematerialises.)  
ZOE: We can't be landing already.  
DOCTOR: Well, that is impossible!  
(The TARDIS is dropping through the air to a sea, where it lands with a gentle
plop.)  
JAMIE: Oh, it's the sea.  
ZOE: Well, don't worry, Jamie. We know the Tardis can't sink.  
JAMIE: Oh, can't it? Look!  
(The scanner is looking straight at a coral reef.)  
ZOE: Oh, now what can we do?  
(A shark swims by.)  
JAMIE: Look out!  
DOCTOR: It's all right. It can't possibly harm us.  
(A type of materialisation noise sounds and the Tardis shakes.)  
JAMIE: I'm not so sure!  
DOCTOR: We're perfectly safe in the Tardis.  
ZOE: Doctor!  
(Water is dripping onto the console.)  
DOCTOR: Oh my word! It's the Time Lords. They're breaking down the defensive
mechanism. We've got to get out of here.  
ZOE: Where can we go?  
DOCTOR: Well, I know one place where we'll be safe, if I can get us there.  
(The Doctor relocates the Tardis.)  
JAMIE: Where are we?  
DOCTOR: We're in outer space. We'll just stop here for a while. There's a
chance we may have given them the slip.  
(A gentle, reasonable voice fills the Tardis.)  
TIME LORD [OC]: There is no escape, Doctor. Return the Tardis immediately to
our home planet.  
DOCTOR: Why can't you leave me alone? I haven't done any harm.  
TIME LORD [OC]: You have broken our laws. You must face your trial.  
JAMIE: Trial?  
TIME LORD [OC]: You will do better to return of your own accord.  
DOCTOR: Oh, oh, oh, very well, if I must.  
ZOE: Doctor, what on Earth are you doing?  
DOCTOR: I'm trying to make a quick transference jump. We've got to get away
from here to somewhere safe. Ah, we're landing.  
(The scanner shows alligators.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, no!  
JAMIE: Is that what you call somewhere safe?  
(The trio are thrown to the floor.)  
ZOE: Oh! It's shaking itself to pieces!  
JAMIE: Yeah, we could all be killed!  
ZOE: Doctor, can't you induce a power drive?  
DOCTOR: I'll try. Oh, the controls. They're moving by themselves.  
(Everything settles down again.)  
JAMIE: Now where are we?  
ZOE: Oh, let's see on the scanner.  
JAMIE: Oh, it's broken.  
ZOE: No, I don't think so.  
(Suddenly the picture resolves itself into a long chamber filled with SIDRATS
along one wall.)  
TIME LORD [OC]: You have returned to us, Doctor. Your travels are over.  
DOCTOR: It's my own planet. They have brought us here.  
JAMIE: Can't we get away again?  
DOCTOR: No, not this time. Come along.

**[SIDRAT bay]**

(A man in a long robe is waiting for them.)  
TIME LORD 2: Come with me.  
JAMIE: Now, just a moment. What's going on around here?  
DOCTOR: Jamie, do as he says.

**[Trial chamber]**

(They are led in. The War Lord is already there. The Time Lord joins two
others.)  
TIME LORD 2: The witnesses have arrived.  
TIME LORD: Let them stand aside until they are needed. Continue with the
trial.  
(Yes, that mellifluous voice is  Bernard Horsfall again.)  
TIME LORD 3: In every one of these time zones, thousands of human beings
fought and died in the belief that they were on their own planet. The
survivors have now all been returned to their own times on the planet Earth,
but the death roll is beyond counting. These lives were squandered in the
course of a vicious and diabolical scheme to gain control of the entire
galaxy. A scheme originated and devised by a race of which the accused is the
leader. It was a was a highly organised scheme with an utterly callous
disregard for the lives of the humans involved and for the liberties of all
the other species in the galaxy which the accused would have dominated with
his tyranny. In the pursuit of this scheme, brutal methods of mental
processing were used which entirely contravened all the galactic laws. I will
now call upon a member of our own race to sort this evil matter out. There
will commence a reading of the witness' report. The witness is called. Will
you step forward, please?  
(Over the above statement, the Doctor is explaining.)  
DOCTOR: The Time Lords holding a trial is a very rare event.  
ZOE: Why?  
DOCTOR: Well, normally they don't interfere with the affairs of other planets,
but they had to when I called for help.  
JAMIE: Well, look, can't we get away?  
DOCTOR: Well, you and Zoe may, but I don't think I will.  
TIME LORD 3: Will you step forward, please?  
DOCTOR: Oh, oh, I beg your pardon.  
TIME LORD 3: We have received your statement. Do you swear to the truth of
your report?  
DOCTOR: Everything in that report is the result of my direct personal
observation.  
TIME LORD 3: Who is that person?  
DOCTOR: That is the War Lord.  
TIME LORD 3: Does the accused have anything to say?  
TIME LORD: You must speak in your defence.  
TIME LORD 2: The trial cannot proceed unless you do.  
TIME LORD 3: You must speak.  
DOCTOR: Can't you see he's just playing for time?  
TIME LORD 3: Do not make us force you to speak. We would not cause you
unnecessary pain. Very well.  
(The Time Lord widens his eyes and suddenly the War Lord falls to his knees
screaming and clutching his head.)  
WAR LORD: Stop it! Stop the light!  
TIME LORD 3: You must speak.  
WAR LORD: Yes.  
TIME LORD 3: Do you admit the charges with which you have been accused?  
WAR LORD: I do not even admit the authority of this court.  
TIME LORD: Have you anything to say in your defence?  
WAR LORD: The humans who died in our war games would have killed each other
anyway.  
TIME LORD 2: Is your plea that that ends justifies the means?  
WAR LORD: Yes, it is. And members of your own race agreed with me. My War
Chief was himself was a Time Lord, and the knowledge he brought me made the
whole scheme possible. And another of your Time Lords gave me his support!  
DOCTOR: I never supported your scheme for one moment.  
WAR LORD: You collaborated with my War Chief. If I am guilty, then you are
guilty too!  
(Meanwhile, two men are inside the Tardis, working on the console. One goes
out to investigate the sound of materialisation and is gunned down by two of
the War Lord's guards. The second then comes out and is also killed. Then a
total of six guards move off.)  
TIME LORD: We find you guilty of all charges against you. Your attempt to
incriminate others is an obvious fraud.  
DOCTOR: Oh, good. I'm glad to see your sense of justice still prevails.
(sotto) Even though they've lost their sense of humour.  
WAR LORD: You have no authority over me.  
(The guards enter.)  
WAR LORD: And no power any longer to pass any sentence. Take these people.  
DOCTOR: Oh, no!  
JAMIE: Not again.  
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie are hustled out.)  
WAR LORD: And if any attempt is made to stop us, then I shall kill them
instantly.  
TIME LORD: Let them go. We shall not endanger innocent lives.

**[SIDRAT bay]**

DOCTOR: You'll never get away. The Time Lords are too strong for you. You
needn't think I'm going to help you.  
WAR LORD: Oh yes, you will help us, Doctor, if you want to save the lives of
your two friends. Now, into the machine.  
JAMIE: Look, the Tardis is no good to you. He can't even steer it properly.  
WAR LORD: Don't talk rubbish. Of course he can steer it. Now, into the
machine!

**[Tardis]**

WAR LORD: Yes, you shall make us many of these machines. Now, get to the
control panel and take us back to the home planet.  
DOCTOR: I can't, I tell you. The directional mechanism is faulty.  
WAR LORD: You will do as I say or we shall kill the girl.  
DOCTOR: But I don't even know where your home planet is.  
WAR LORD: Galactic sector nine seven three, then we will get the homing
signal. Now operate the machine!  
DOCTOR: I'll do my best, but I can't promise anything. Jamie, Zoe, hide your
eyes. Run!  
(The Tardis lights are blinding.)  
WAR LORD: Get after them! Kill them! Quickly!

**[SIDRAT bay]**

(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe run over to the Time Lords.)  
WAR LORD: Kill them!  
(But a forcefield stops the guards.)  
TIME LORD 3: A force field has been placed around you, and around your planet,
so that your warlike people will remain prisoners forever. You have been found
guilty of all charges, and you and your murderous associates will be
dematerialised. It will be as though you had never existed.  
WAR LORD: No, no, no, no!  
(The War Lord and the guards vanish.)  
JAMIE: Ah, well, that's put an end to them. Well, we'll be on our way. Come
on, Doctor. Cheerio.  
(Jamie strolls over to the Tardis and straight into the forcefield which then
envelopes him and Zoe.)  
JAMIE: Oh, switch this thing off.  
DOCTOR: Jamie, they are not going to let us go.  
JAMIE: What? After all you've done for them?  
(The Doctor and two Time Lords leave.)  
ZOE: What are you going to do to him?  
TIME LORD 3: He must stand his trial. You will wait here.  
ZOE: Well, we want to go with the Doctor! Oh, let us out!  
JAMIE: Come on, let us out of this thing!

**[Trial chamber]**

TIME LORD: You have heard the charge against you, that you have repeatedly
broken our most important law of non-interference in the affairs of other
planets. What have you to say? Do you admit these actions?  
DOCTOR: I not only admit them, I am proud of them. While you have been content
merely to observe the evil in the galaxy, I have been fighting against it.  
TIME LORD 3: It is not we who are on trial here, Doctor, it is you.  
DOCTOR: No, no, of course, you're above criticism, aren't you.  
TIME LORD: Do you admit that these actions were justified?  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, I do. Give me a thought channel and I'll show you some
of the evils I've been fighting against.  
(The Time Lords nod to each other.)  
DOCTOR: The Quarks, deadly robot servants of the cruel Dominators, they tried
to enslave a peace loving race. Then there were the Yeti, more robot killers,
instruments of an alien intelligence trying to take over the planet Earth.  
TIME LORD 3: All this is entirely irrelevant.  
DOCTOR: You asked me to justify my actions, I am doing so. Let me show you the
Ice Warriors, cruel Martian invaders, they tried to conquer the Earth too. So
did the Cybermen, half creature, half machine. But worst of all were the
Daleks, a pitiless race of conquerors exterminating all who came up against
them. All these evils I have fought while you have done nothing but observe.
True, I am guilty of interference, just as you are guilty of failing to use
your great powers to help those in need!  
TIME LORD: Is that all you have to say?  
DOCTOR: Well, isn't it enough?  
TIME LORD: Your defence has been heard and will be carefully considered, but
you have raised difficult issues. We require time to think about them. You
will be recalled when we have made our decision.

**[SIDRAT bay]**

JAMIE: Let us out!  
ZOE: We want to see the Doctor. Let us out of here!  
(The force field is turned off.)  
TIME LORD 2: Follow me.  
ZOE: Where are we going?  
TIME LORD 2: We're going to send you home. Back you your own world and your
own time.  
JAMIE: Oh no, not without the Doctor.  
TIME LORD 2: This is his world. He must stay here.  
ZOE: Well, what's going to happen to him?  
TIME LORD 2: He is awaiting the result of his trial.  
JAMIE: Aye, well, I'm not going till I see him.  
ZOE: Oh, please, can't we see the Doctor?  
TIME LORD 2: You have become attached to him?  
JAMIE: Aye, we've been through a lot, you know.  
ZOE: Please let us see him.  
TIME LORD 2: Come with me.  
JAMIE: Aye.

**[Trial chamber]**

(The Doctor is reclining on the floor, playing clock patience.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie! Zoe!  
ZOE: Doctor!  
(They are stopped by a forcefield.)  
TIME LORD 2: I've brought your friends to say goodbye.  
JAMIE: Oh, switch this thing off.  
ZOE: We can't say goodbye through a forcefield.  
TIME LORD 2: Very well. I shall leave you together. for a little while.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.  
(The forcefield disappears and the Time Lord leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie! Zoe!  
ZOE: Doctor!  
JAMIE: What are they going to do to you?  
DOCTOR: Oh, nothing much. I expect they'll to make me listen to a long boring
speech about being a good boy. They like making speeches.  
ZOE: Well, I think it's time you left them again.  
DOCTOR: Well, that's easier said than done.  
JAMIE: Oh come on, we've been in tighter situations than this.  
DOCTOR: Well, you don't know the Time Lords, Jamie. I do.  
ZOE: Oh, you're not just going to give up, are you, Doctor?  
JAMIE: Of course he's not. Are you, Doctor, eh?  
DOCTOR: Well. Oh, all right, but we may find it a bit difficult getting out of
here.  
JAMIE: Hey, they've forgotten to switch that thing back on again.  
DOCTOR: Forgotten?  
ZOE: Well, that's all we need, isn't it? Now we can get away.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course.  
JAMIE: Come on!  
(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe pick their way through an area of square pools of
mist to )

**[SIDRAT bay]**

TIME LORD 3: There is no escape, Doctor.  
(Jamie runs up against a forcefield.)  
TIME LORD 3: It is time to say goodbye to your friends.  
ZOE: There must be something we can do?  
DOCTOR: No Zoe, not this time. Well, goodbye, Jamie.  
JAMIE: But Doctor surely we could  
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Jamie.  
JAMIE: I won't forget you, you know.  
DOCTOR: I won't forget you. Don't go blundering into too much trouble, will
you?  
JAMIE: Oh, you're a fine one to talk.  
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Zoe.  
ZOE: Goodbye, Doctor. Will we ever meet again?  
DOCTOR: Again? Now, Zoe, you and I know, time is relative, isn't it?  
(Jamie and Zoe are led to a SIDRAT. They wave and go inside. It
dematerialises.)  
DOCTOR: They'll forget me, won't they?  
TIME LORD 2: Not entirely. They will be returned to a time just before they
went away with you. They will remember their first adventure with you, but
nothing more. But come along. Your fate has been decided.

**[The Wheel in Space]**

(The Doctor watches on the trial chamber viewscreen as a confused Zoe walks
down a corridor.)  
TANYA: Oh, Zoe. Zoe, are you all right?  
ZOE: Oh, yes.  
TANYA: Are the Doctor and Jamie gone?  
ZOE: Yes, I've just seen them off.  
TANYA: Well, we'd better get back to work, you know. There's a lot to be done
if we're going to get the Wheel back to normal. Are you sure you're all right?  
ZOE: Oh, yes. I thought I'd forgotten something important, but it's nothing.  
TANYA: Right, come along then.  
ZOE: All right, I'm coming.

**[Trial chamber]**

(On the screen, Zoe looks back then the image fades.)  
DOCTOR: She'll be all right, won't she?  
TIME LORD: Of course.  
DOCTOR: What about Jamie?  
TIME LORD 3: Look.

**[Culloden Moor]**

(Pipes are skirling as a Redcoat aims his musket at Jamie's back. He turns and
drops just as the soldier fires.)  
JAMIE: Try to murder a McCrimmon, would you? Well, I'll show you! Creag an
Tuire!  
(Jamie charges the Redcoat, swinging his sword while the man tries to reload.
The soldier wisely gives up and flees.)

**[Trial chamber]**

TIME LORD: They will both continue their lives as if nothing had happened.  
DOCTOR: Yes, very efficient. Now then, what about me?  
TIME LORD: We have accepted your plea that there is evil in the universe that
must be fought, and that you still have a part to play in that battle.  
DOCTOR: What? You mean that you're going to let me go free?  
TIME LORD: Not entirely. We have noted your particular interest in the planet
Earth. The frequency of your visits must have given you special knowledge of
that world and it's problems.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose that's true. Earth seems more vulnerable than others,
yes.  
TIME LORD: For that reason you will be sent back to that planet.  
DOCTOR: Oh, good.  
TIME LORD: In exile.  
DOCTOR: In exile?  
TIME LORD: You will be sent to Earth in the twentieth century, and will remain
there for as long as we deem proper, and for that period the secret of the
Tardis will be taken from you.  
DOCTOR: But you, you can't condemn me to exile on one primitive planet in one
century in time! Besides, I'm known on the Earth. It might be very awkward for
me.  
TIME LORD: Your appearance has changed before, it will change again. That is
part of the sentence.  
DOCTOR: You can't just change what I look like without consulting me!  
TIME LORD: You will have an opportunity to choose your appearance.  
DOCTOR: Oh, well, that's not so bad. But I warn you, I'm very particular.  
TIME LORD: Here is your first choice.  
(A man with a big bushy beard, followed by other sketches.)  
DOCTOR: Oh he's too old! Well he's too fat, isn't he. No, he's too thin. That
one's too young. Oh now, that won't do at all. It's ridiculous.  
TIME LORD: You're wasting time, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: It's not my fault, is it? Is this the best you can do? I've never seen
such an incredible bunch.  
TIME LORD: Since you refuse to take the decision, the decision will be taken
for you.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, I never said that. But I maintain I have the right to
decide what I look like! It could be very important on the Earth. People on
Earth attach a very great deal of importance  
(The Doctor's face is beginning to twist and change.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, what's happening?  
(We are treated to multiple images of Patrick gurning as they circle around.)  
DOCTOR: What's hap, what's happened?  
TIME LORD: The time has come for you to change your appearance, Doctor, and
begin your exile.  
DOCTOR: Is this some sort of joke? No, I refuse to be treated in. What are you
doing?  
(The Doctor's face disappears.)  
DOCTOR: No! Stop, you're making me giddy! No, you can't do this to me! No, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
