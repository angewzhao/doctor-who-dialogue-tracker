__**Episode One**__

**[Tardis]**

(The Tardis is going haywire.)  
JAMIE: What's he done?  
BEN: Doctor, do something!  
DOCTOR: I'm trying to!  
JAMIE: We're not going to make it.  
(Everyone is being thrown across the room and back as the Doctor fights the
controls. Soon everything settles down.)  
DOCTOR: I have it back in control again.  
BEN: Here, we're landing. Look. Coming at a fair rate.  
JAMIE: Oh, thank the Lord for that. You know, Doctor, I'll never ask you to do
that again.  
DOCTOR: Huh? Oh, no. There must have been a reason for that.  
POLLY: Anyway, Doctor, you've done it. It's Mars. It must be. You're landing
the Tardis exactly where you said you would.  
(The Tardis materialises amongst magnificent desolation.)  
BEN: Hey, wait a mo! This don't look like Mars to me.  
POLLY: How would you know? You never seen it.  
BEN: No, Duchess, but I have seen pictures of the moon's surface and that's
what this looks like.  
JAMIE: That's the moon?  
POLLY: Doctor, is it the moon?  
(The Doctor nods.)  
BEN: Oh, well, you weren't too far out, were you? Only about two hundred
million miles.  
DOCTOR: All right, let's move on. While we can.  
POLLY: Now wait a minute!  
BEN: What?  
POLLY: You don't expect to land us on the moon and let us fly off just like
that, do you?  
BEN: Yeah, at least let us have a look around!  
JAMIE: That picture canna be the moon. The moon's way up in the sky.  
DOCTOR: Where do you think you're going?  
BEN: You're not going to tell us there's no shore leave.  
POLLY: Ah, please, Doctor. The Tardis isn't out of control or anything is it?  
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. It was just a bumpy landing, that's all.  
BEN: Yeah?  
DOCTOR: Well, if you must go ashore, only half an hour.  
BEN: Right.  
POLLY: Super.  
DOCTOR: You can't go ashore like that! You need space suits. There's no
atmosphere out there. Come on, there's some in the chest.  
(Jamie is still staring at the scanner.)  
JAMIE: We'll maybe meet the old man in the moon.  
BEN: You won't meet nobody mate if you don't get some gear on.  
JAMIE: What? Oh aye.

**[Lunar surface]**

(Some time later, all four of them are suited up and they leave the Tardis to
look around.)  
DOCTOR: Come on now, let's go over here.  
POLLY: Hey, look at this.  
DOCTOR: It's deserted.  
JAMIE: I don't think I like it.  
(Polly sees a pulsating light.)  
POLLY: Look, over there.  
JAMIE: I'll don't see anything.  
BEN: What did you see?  
POLLY: Some sort of great glow in the sky.  
BEN: It's probably your eyes getting used to the lunar light, hey, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Possibly.  
POLLY: What do we need these great clogs for?  
DOCTOR: Try a little jump.  
POLLY: All right.  
(Polly takes a small jump and rises about ten feet, falling slowly and rolling
gently as she lands. Ben and Jamie copy her and collide.)  
DOCTOR: Careful! One tear in that space suit and you'll suffocate.  
POLLY: You never told me you'd taken ballet lessons, Ben.  
(Polly takes a big jump to a the crater rim.)  
POLLY: Come on, it's easy.  
BEN: Look out, here I come.  
(Jamie jumps too far and goes over the rim and out of sight.)  
POLLY: Where's he gone?  
BEN: Over there.  
(From the rim of the crater they look down on a large domed building.)  
POLLY: What on Earth? Look!  
BEN: Blimey! What is it?  
POLLY: Doctor, what is it?  
DOCTOR: I don't know.  
POLLY: Hey, I can see Jamie. There he is.  
(Jamie is lying unconscious by the dome.)  
BEN: Hey, there's somebody coming out.  
DOCTOR: Come on, let's go.  
(Two spacesuited figures come out of the dome's airlock and take Jamie inside.
The Doctor, Ben and Polly hurry to the dome and Ben knocks on the airlock.
Then it slides open. After a brief pause, they all go in.)

**[Control room]**

(The moonbase is a weather control centre. A small team of scientists govern
weather patterns on Earth using a powerful device called the Gravitron. A map
of the Earth dominates one wall, and the Gravitron probe is in a transparent
dome on one side of the room with it's power controls in an insulated room.
Each person wears a numbered uniform, and the gravitron technicians wear
protective headgear. They are monitoring a Pacific hurricane or typhoon when
one of the workers collapses. An alarm sounds.)  
BENOIT: (2nd in command, French) What on Earth is it?  
(Played by  Andre Maranne, possibly the only genuine French actor the BBC
knew.)  
(A web of black lines covers the stricken man's face.)  
HOBSON: (base commander) I don't know. Get him along to the Medical unit.  
BENOIT: But Doctor Evans has gone down with it as well.  
HOBSON: Yes, I know that but the relief Doctor from Earth should be here on
the next shuttle rocket.  
BENOIT: Yes, yes, of course. Bob, give me a hand, will you?  
BOB: Yes, right.  
(Benoit and Bob carry the man out.)  
HOBSON: And Jules, you take over. Come on, it won't bite you. There must be
some source to this infection. Look, we'd better get the lads in here and tell
them what's happening. Get them on the blower, would you, Nils?  
NILS: (the number 3, Danish) Okay, Hobby. (into intercom) Nils speaking. We,
er, we've got a bit of a flap on up here.  
(Hobson is distracted by the arrival of the Doctor, Polly and Ben next door.)

**[Reception room]**

NILS [OC]: Mister Hobson wants a word with you all in weather control room.
Quick as you can.  
HOBSON: Hello. Where did you lot spring from? Don't tell me the shuttle
rocket's arrived already?  
DOCTOR: No, it hasn't.  
SAM: There was another one with them, sir. Bob's taken him along to the
Medical unit. He's all right. He's just knocked himself out or something.  
HOBSON: Oh no, if we haven't got enough troubles already. Have they been
through the sterile room?  
SAM: Yes, Hobby.  
DOCTOR: We don't want to cause you any trouble. Just let us collect our young
friend and we'll be off.  
HOBSON: Hey, not so fast.  
POLLY: Please, let me go and see Jamie.  
BENOIT: I will take you there, mademoiselle, if you come with me.  
HOBSON: All right, young lady. You can carry on.  
BENOIT: This way.  
(Polly and Benoit leave.)  
HOBSON: But I'd just like to have a word with you two. You could do with a
extra bacteria check by the look of it.  
DOCTOR: Bacteria check?  
HOBSON: That's what I said.  
BEN: Well, thanks.  
DOCTOR: I'll have you know our Tardis is as sterile as  
HOBSON: Tardis?  
DOCTOR: Our space craft.  
NILS: They're all here, sir. Any time you're ready.  
HOBSON: Right. Well, we'll learn about your spacecraft a little later.
Meanwhile, you'd better come along with me, meet my team and listen to what I
have to say.  
DOCTOR: Thank you very much.

**[Control room]**

HOBSON: Well, you know what this place is?  
DOCTOR: Well, it looks like some sort of weather control centre? Ah, yes. And
that's the thing with which you control the weather. That's the culprit, then.  
BEN: Ay?  
DOCTOR: That's what gave us such a bumpy landing. Some sort of gravity device?  
HOBSON: Some sort of gravity device. You are from Earth, aren't you?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
HOBSON: Well, where've you been for the past 20 years. Every school kid knows
about the Gravitron in there.  
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. It must be about the year 2050, Ben.  
HOBSON: We've got a proper Rip Van Winkle here. It's 2070, in case you'd like
to know.  
DOCTOR: There you are. I was only twenty years out.  
HOBSON: Well, before we all forget what century we're in, I'd better tell you
why I've called you here.  
DOCTOR: Won't you introduce us first? I am a Doctor.  
HOBSON: A Doctor? You're arrived just in time. We need your help.  
DOCTOR: Ah. Do you?  
HOBSON: I'll see you in a moment. Now, this virus  
DOCTOR: Well, I may be able to help you if you'll introduce us.  
HOBSON: Right, Doctor. You'd better meet them all. We're all scientists here,
you see. No room for idle hands, I see to that. Roger Benoit, beside you
there, is my assistant. He takes over as Chief Scientist if anything happens
to me. He's a physicist like me and Joe Benson there. Nils, our mad Dane, is
an astronomer and mathematician as is Charlie here. Ralph, Jules and Franz are
geologists. When they're not acting as cooks, looks-outs, general and, you
know, handymen.  
DOCTOR: And this is where you control the Earth's weather? I see.  
BENOIT: The gravitron there controls the tides, the tides controls the
weather. And from this console here we plot it all on that map. Simple, eh?  
BEN: Oh, yeah, very simple. Wish we'd had all this back in 1966.  
DOCTOR: Was it a bad year then?  
(An alarm sounds.)  
BEN: What's that? What's happened?  
(A man has collapsed inside the gravitron chamber.)  
HOBSON: It's Jim. Quick, Franz, take over here.  
(Franz puts on a helmet and goes into the chamber. Ralph and John carry Jim to
the medical unit.)  
BENOIT: Indicator Five over the Pacific is starting to move.  
BEN: What does that mean?  
DOCTOR: Some form of change in the weather.  
HOBSON: We're soon hear from Earth what it means.  
NILS: Here it comes!  
CONTROL [OC]: International Space Control Headquarters Earth calling Weather
Control Moon. Come in please.  
NILS: Moonport standing by.  
CONTROL [OC]: Earth calling Weather Control Moon. Come in please.  
NILS: Moonport standing by.  
HOBSON: Hobson here.  
CONTROL [OC]: What's happening up there? The hurricane you were guiding is now
45 degrees off course. It's threatening Hawaii.  
HOBSON: One of my men was taken ill. We're operational again now.  
CONTROL [OC]: The controller would like to know the cause of the illness.  
HOBSON: Yes, so would we. We've now got three men down with this mystery virus
in the past few hours, including the doctor.  
CONTROL [OC]: One moment please. Stand by for further instructions.  
HOBSON: Just hang on another couple of minutes, lads. We'd better hear what
the great Mister Rinberg has to say.  
NILS: Hobby?  
HOBSON: Yes.  
NILS: There it is again. I'll play it back to you.  
HOBSON [OC]: Yes, so would we. We've now got three men down with this mystery
virus in the past few hours, including the Doctor.  
CONTROL [OC]: One moment please. Stand by for further instructions.  
NILS: Hear the big noise ratio on that re-run? We're being monitored again.  
HOBSON: Monitored?  
NILS: Someone, not too far away from the base, is listening to every word we
say.  
CONTROL [OC]: Moonbase, Moonbase. Come in, Moonbase.  
HOBSON: Still standing by.

**[Spacecraft]**

(An alien spacecraft is concealed a short way from the dome, monitoring the
conversation.)  
HOBSON [OC]: Well?  
CONTROL [OC]: Your instructions are to send blood samples back to Earth for
investigation.  
HOBSON [OC]: Well, when can we do that? The next shuttle rocket's not for
another month.  
CONTROL [OC]: Then they must be put on that rocket. In the meantime the
Moonbase is to be put in quarantine.

**[Control room]**

HOBSON: Quarantine? What if these men aren't fit enough to get back to work. I
shall need replacements.  
CONTROL [OC]: If you radio information about this virus, we'll do our best to
identify it and suggest treatment.  
HOBSON: I demand to speak to Rinberg.

**[Space ship]**

CONTROL [OC]: The controller is busy. I'm sorry. Over and out.

**[Control room]**

NILS: That whole conversion was monitored by someone or something.  
HOBSON: Oh, never mind about that now. That Rinberg fellow just won't talk to
you. How can we trace down this mystery illness with the doctor himself down
with it.  
DOCTOR: We'd better get out of these things and see how Jamie is. Perhaps I
could be of help in the sick bay now.  
HOBSON: Anything you can do. Bob!  
BOB: Yes, Mister Hobson?  
HOBSON: Show him to the Medical unit, will you?  
BOB: Yes, of course, sir. Will you come this way, please.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Thank you.  
(Bob, Ben and the Doctor leave.)  
HOBSON: Well, you all heard the position. We don't know what this infection is
or how it got into the base, but I want you all to take extra precautions
while this emergency is on. We may be short-handed for quite a while.

**[Sickbay]**

(Polly is attaching a medical monitor to Jamie's chest.)  
POLLY: Is this how it goes, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Then this unit automatically controls the pulse,
the temperature and the breathing.  
POLLY: A sort of electronic doctor.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Almost got striped trousers.  
BEN: And it even gives him medicines too?  
DOCTOR: Yes, it will do very nearly everything.  
POLLY: It can't be nice to him. Oh dear. How do you think he is, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Oh, he's not too bad. He's a bit concussed and feverish, but he'll be
all right with rest.  
JAMIE: The Piper. The McCrimmon Piper. Don't let him get me!  
DOCTOR: Piper?  
POLLY: Some legend of his clan. As far as I can make out, this piper appears
to a McCrimmon just before he dies.  
DOCTOR: Has this phantom piper appeared to Jamie yet?  
POLLY: You don't believe it, do you?  
DOCTOR: No, but he does. It's important to him.  
POLLY: He keeps asking us to keep the piper away from him.  
DOCTOR: Good. Well, we'll see whether we can do just that.  
BEN: Well, carry on, nurse.  
POLLY: Well, at least I tried to help. With a ward full of sick men and no
doctor, somebody's got to do something.  
(A patient is groaning.)  
POLLY: I wonder who this is?  
DOCTOR: Don't get too near, Polly. Have a look on his chart.  
POLLY: Yes, that's a good idea.  
BEN: It's Doctor Evans.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. The station doctor. He was the first one to get it.  
POLLY: He looks one of the worst.  
DOCTOR: There's something about this epidemic that I don't quite understand.
It's not like a real disease at all. It's almost as if  
BEN: Not real? What more do you want?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. But there are certain signs and symptoms which don't add
up. Ben, I want you to go along to the control room and keep an eye on things.  
BEN: Well, how?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. Give a hand, do anything, but keep your eyes and ears
open.  
BEN: Right.  
DOCTOR: There's something very wrong here. Very wrong indeed.

**[Control room]**

(The base is on it's night cycle. Benoit returns from a break.)  
BENOIT: Still up, Hobby? Why not take a rest. Go and get some sleep.  
HOBSON: How can I rest with that thing up the spout. You know the score as
well as I do. Five units off centre we lift half London into space. Five more
and the Atlantic water level goes up three feet. Rinberg just doesn't
understand the pressure we're under. Hey, you! What do you thinking you're
doing skulking there?  
BEN: Well, I was just wondering if I can help, sir.  
HOBSON: Help? How could you help?  
BENOIT: We could do with an extra pair of hands. He can help me.  
HOBSON: Well, keep him away from me, that's all. All right, I'll go and lie
down. Call me if anything happens.  
BENOIT: Yes, of course.  
HOBSON: Oh, by the way. There were two more of those momentary drops in air
pressure while I was on. I've put them in the log.  
BENOIT: Right.  
(Hobson leaves.)  
BENOIT: Well, there are some coffee cups to clear away if you wish to be
helpful. And er, oh er, Ralph, that is, no. 14, needs a hand down in the food
store. Can you find your way there?  
BEN: Yeah, I'll find it.  
BENOIT: Good boy.

**[Food store]**

(Ralph is loading a trolley with supplies from the shelves and ticking them
off a list. He picks up a sack of sugar and the contents spill onto the floor
through a hole in the bottom. He throws it into the waste disposal.)  
RALPH: (american) Anyone would think we've got rats up here.  
(A tin falls.)  
RALPH: Who's that? Who is it?  
BEN: It's only me, mate.  
RALPH: Oh, for heaven's sake. Don't go sneaking around like that.  
BEN: Blimey, you lot aren't half edgy.  
RALPH: You will be too, mate, if you've been up here long enough. Say, are you
responsible for the broken bags here.  
BEN: Come off it. I've only just arrived, haven't I?  
RALPH: Okay. See and you can find that light. Round the back there, most
likely.  
BEN: Okay.  
RALPH: Let's see. We still need some more milk and sugar.  
(As Ralph searches the shelves a huge figure looms out of the darkness.
There's an electric shock sound. Ralph's body is dragged away before Ben
returns.)  
BEN: Number 14? Ralph? Where are you? Scarpered. Funny bloke.

**[Sickbay]**

(Polly is dozing.)  
POLLY: What's that?  
DOCTOR: Shh. It's all right, Polly, it's only me. We don't want to wake
everybody up, do we? You look as though you could do with some sleep yourself.  
POLLY: I'm all right. What have you got there?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I've been doing a little investigation.  
POLLY: A piece of silver paper. What is it?  
DOCTOR: I don't know.  
(The lights dim.)  
POLLY: What's happened?  
DOCTOR: Oh, it's nothing. It probably just a changeover in the time cycle.  
POLLY: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: Oh well, you see, it's rather interesting really. You see, on the moon
they have a fortnight of days and a fortnight of nights.  
POLLY: Well?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's obvious, isn't it? They have to make their own day and
night artificially up here, or it would upset their whole biological time
clock.  
POLLY: Their what?  
DOCTOR: They won't know whether they were coming or going. Get it?  
POLLY: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Clever girl. QED. That's why it's dark up here.  
POLLY: Oh, I see what you mean. Yes, of course. How stupid of me.  
DOCTOR: Of course along at the control centre it's probably broad daylight.
Polly, you wouldn't be making fun of me, would you?  
POLLY: No.  
(A man screams.)  
POLLY: Doctor Evans!  
(Evans is sweating heavily, and delirious.)  
EVANS: The hand. No, don't touch me. No. The silver hand. (scream)  
POLLY: Doctor, is he?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid he is.  
POLLY: What are we going to do?  
DOCTOR: What did he mean by the silver hand? I'd better report this to Mister
Hobson.

**[Control room]**

(Ben is reporting Ralph's disappearance.)  
HOBSON: Can't find him? Ralph?  
BEN: Well, I was helping him load some stores and he just disappeared.  
HOBSON: What, in this place? Well, there are only nineteen of us.  
DOCTOR: Have you tried his quarters?  
BEN: Yeah.  
HOBSON: Why didn't you report this to me?  
BEN: Well, I'm just telling you now, aren't I?  
HOBSON: Now what is the matter?  
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry. It's Doctor Evans.  
HOBSON: Well?  
DOCTOR: I'm afraid he's dead.  
HOBSON: Dead? No.  
BENOIT: This must be reported at once.  
HOBSON: Yes, yes. No! No, we haven't got enough data yet. You know what
they're like down there. I'll come to the sick bay with you. Come on.

**[Sickbay]**

(Polly is helping Jamie drink a glass of water.)  
POLLY: Here. Gently, Jamie.  
(Jamie's eyes widen in panic as he sees something behind Polly.)  
POLLY: Jamie!  
(Jamie tries to speak, then passes out again. Polly turns and screams. The
Doctor, Hobson and others run in.)  
HOBSON: What the matter?  
POLLY: Something just went out of that door!  
HOBSON: Nils! John!  
DOCTOR: What was it?  
NILS: Nothing. Nothing there.  
HOBSON: Your nerves are getting the better of you. Where's Evans' body?  
POLLY: Over there.  
HOBSON: All right, let's get it over.  
(Nils lifts the blanket but the bed is empty.)  
HOBSON: Is this someone's idea of a particularly bad joke?  
DOCTOR: This is no joke, believe me!  
BENOIT: Mister Hobson, Mister Hobson, you are wanted! Another man's collapsed
at the controls. The Gravitron has gone off alignment again.  
HOBSON: Come on! And you'd better find that doctor's body or out you all go,
quarantine or no quarantine.  
(Hobson, Benoit and co all leave.)  
POLLY: I don't understand what could have happened. I must have dozed off or
something. One thing I am sure of. Something went out of that door just as you
came in.  
DOCTOR: That body can't just have vanished. Polly, I'm going to leave you
alone, now just for a minute.  
POLLY: All right.  
JAMIE: Water. Water.  
POLLY: I'll go and get you some.  
JAMIE: Water.  
(Polly leaves. The other door slides open and a tall figure moves across the
room to Jamie's bed. Jamie looks at it.)  
JAMIE: It's you. The phantom piper!

__**Episode Two**__

**[Sickbay]**

(Jamie suddenly sits up and stares at the tall silver figure in front of him.
It has a blank metal face with round eye holes and a slit for the mouth. Tubes
come from where its ears should be and connect at a round device on the top of
it's head. We seen something like this before, but Jamie hasn't.)  
JAMIE: No! No, I'll not go with you. Do you hear me, piper? No, leave me.
Leave me, I'll not go with you, do you hear me? Leave me. No, I'll not go with
you.  
(The cyberman goes round the other beds.)  
JAMIE: I'll fight you every inch of the way. I'll not go with ya. No. No.  
(The cyberman takes the blanket off another patient and carries off the
struggling man.)  
JAMIE: Leave me, piper. No, leave me, I'll not go.  
(Polly returns with the water for Jamie. She screams. Hobson, the Doctor, Ben
and two other men run in.)  
DOCTOR: Polly! Polly, what's happened?  
POLLY: Oh, Doctor! Doctor, it was horrible. A great creature like a, like a
Cyberman.  
DOCTOR: It's all right. Don't be frightened. Whatever it was, it's all gone
now.  
POLLY: Yes, but Doctor, the Cyberman was carrying one of the patients out!  
DOCTOR: Cyberman?  
HOBSON: Cyberman? What are you talking about?  
POLLY: I'm sure it was. I'm sure it was!  
DOCTOR: Are you sure?  
JAMIE: I'll not go with you!  
BEN: All right, mate. You're safe now. Take it easy.  
POLLY: Yes it did, I promise you.  
HOBSON: She's right. There's another one gone. Sam, Jules, you've got to find
these men. They can't just disappear in a place this size. Search every square
inch, don't come back until you've found them. Now move.  
(Sam and Jules leave.)  
HOBSON: Now, supposing you tell me your story. What did you see?  
POLLY: Well, I went out to get Jamie some water and when I came back I saw
this giant man or creature or something just going out of the door carrying
one of the patients like a doll. I think it was a Cyberman.  
HOBSON: Forget the Cyberman part. Then what?  
POLLY: Well, then nothing. The door shut and then you came in.  
HOBSON: What do you know about all this?  
DOCTOR: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.  
HOBSON: We'll see about that in a minute. This thing you saw, what was it
like?  
POLLY: It was enormous and silver, and it had holes in it's head for eyes,
like a robot!  
HOBSON: A robot?  
BEN: But the Cybermen were all killed when Mondas blew up, weren't they?  
HOBSON: Stop this Cyberman nonsense. There were Cybermen, every child knows
that, but they were all destroyed ages ago.  
DOCTOR: So we all thought.  
HOBSON: That's enough. Now let's have a little calm thinking. For the past two
weeks a completely unknown disease has appeared in the base. People drop in
their tracks, they develop this black pattern on their skin. Then some of the
patients disappear, right? Well, they can't leave the base without wearing
space suits, and there are no space suits missing, so where are they?  
DOCTOR: I must say it does sound a little odd.  
HOBSON: More than a little. Well I do know one thing. A new disease starts,
people disappear and then you turn up.  
POLLY: And you think we did it.  
BEN: Oh, come off it, we haven't done a thing.  
HOBSON: That's as maybe. I don't know who you are, what you are or where you
come from. But you can get off the moon now.  
BEN: Yeah, well that suits me fine. The sooner the better.  
DOCTOR: No, Ben. We can't go yet.  
BEN: Well, why not? They don't want us here.  
DOCTOR: Because there is something evil here and we must stay.  
HOBSON: Evil? Don't be daft.  
DOCTOR: Evil is what I meant. There are some corners of the universe which
have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything that
we believe in. They must be fought. This disease, for instance. It isn't
really a disease at all, but I can help you with it. You'll see. I'll find the
cause for you.  
HOBSON: Will you, indeed?  
DOCTOR: Yes, certainly. I just need to examine a few things, that's all. It
should be simple.  
HOBSON: Well, I'm not sure. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you just one
Earth day cycle to find the cause.  
BEN: Earth what?  
HOBSON: Twenty four hours.  
BEN: But that's no time at all.  
HOBSON: It's all the time you're going to get. Then you get off the moon,
complete with this bloke here.  
POLLY: But you can't move him. He's very ill.  
DOCTOR: We accept. Now tell me, you have pathological equipment here, yes?  
HOBSON: Yes, Evans was working on an extensive research project. It's all in
here.  
(They go to an area marked off by a ring of workbenches and shelves.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'll have a look in here.  
HOBSON: It's quite a small unit. We're not equipped to deal with a full scale
epidemic, you understand. Do you think you can manage?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can.  
HOBSON: Right. Well, I'll leave you to it. But don't forget, twenty four
hours.  
(Hobson leaves. The Doctor takes a tray of items over to a patient.)  
BEN: What are you going to do, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: We're going to start with this one.  
POLLY: Listen, are you really a medical doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I was once, Polly. I think I took a degree once in
Glasgow. 1888 I think. Lister. Hold that for me, will you?  
(The Doctor swabs a black-lined hand, and the arm convulses.)  
DOCTOR: It's all right. He's quite unconscious.  
BEN: Well look, what can we do to help?  
DOCTOR: I shall need to examine everything. Clothes, boots, food, towels,
soap, everything. Will you get them for me, please?  
POLLY: Have you any idea what it might be?  
DOCTOR: No. Not an idea. But we'll find it out.

**[Control room]**

HOBSON: I don't understand it. I'm sure there's a lack of co-ordination
somewhere.  
BENOIT: Yes, but where?  
HOBSON: On the indicators, look. It should be steady as a rock.  
BENOIT: The fault must be in the gravitron.  
HOBSON: Nils, here.  
NILS: Yes Hobby?  
HOBSON: I'm going to run a test. Move the probe and we'll see if the
indicators move the right distance on the map. Okay?  
NILS: Right.  
HOBSON: Benoit, keep an eye on the probe itself, will you?  
BENOIT: Okay. All yours, Bob.  
BOB: Right.  
(Benoit walks over to watch the gravitron probe.)  
HOBSON: Deflect probe five degrees, now. Way off. Five degrees should put them
over Iceland. Move the probe back again.  
NILS: Right.  
BENOIT: The probe seems to deflect all right.  
HOBSON: The fault must be here. This could be a major disaster if we can't
stabilise the Earth's field.  
NILS: If we lose that hurricane, Mister Hobson, all hell will break loose on
the Earth. I've a wife and family.  
HOBSON: Yeah, you're not the only one. Roger, check the potentiometers.  
BENOIT: Right.  
(Benoit puts on a helmet and enters the control area.)  
HOBSON: Nils, check the gravitation units. Shake it up. We haven't got much
time.  
NILS: Field stabilising at 48, Mister Hobson.  
HOBSON: Prepare to move probe. Check co-ordinates. We've got to hold that
hurricane in the Pacific. Stand by. Now.  
(Benoit returns.)  
BENOIT: Twenty degree tilt complete.  
HOBSON: The field's not correcting. We'll have to increase the reactor power.  
BENOIT: You can't do that. The torus will burn out.  
HOBSON: It's all we can do.  
(The communication centre comes into life.)  
CONTROL [OC]: International Space Control.  
R/T: Earth calling.  
CONTROL [OC]: Earth calling Moon Weather Control. Stand by. Stand by for the
controller.  
R/T: This is Moonbase. Come in please.  
CONTROL [OC]: We wish to speak to Mister Hobson.  
HOBSON: Hobson speaking.  
CONTROL [OC]: Stand by for the Controller.  
HOBSON: Right. He's actually going to speak to us this time.  
RINBERG [OC]: Controller Rinberg speaking. Is that you, Hobson?  
HOBSON: Yes, Rinberg.  
RINBERG [OC]: The directional fields are showing a progressive error. Reports
have come in of wide-spread pressure fluctuations in Atlantic zone 6. You must
get the gravitron back into balance.  
HOBSON: We're trying to compensate by re-aligning the probe. We have an error
in the servos.  
RINBERG [OC]: Well, there's no sign of any improvement here. We've just had a
report from Miami, Florida. Thirty minutes ago they were enjoying clear skies
and a heat wave. Now Hurricane Lucy is right overhead.  
BENOIT: There is only one thing to do.  
HOBSON: What's that?  
BENOIT: Shut it down.  
HOBSON: What, switch the gravitron off?!  
BENOIT: Yes, it's the only chance.  
HOBSON: We can't do that, man. The collapse of the gravity would devastate
half the globe. There'd be storms, whirlwinds, hurricanes.  
RINBERG [OC]: I overheard your conversation. It's quite out of the question.
You're not to shut down the gravitron under any circumstances, and that's an
order. I think perhaps you don't appreciate how serious the situation already
is.  
HOBSON: I bet he gets a knighthood.  
RINBERG [OC]: We spent years in a general assembly negotiating methods of
agreement between farmers and landowners and so on. Now the weather's out of
control they're after our blood, and I must say I can't blame them. You've got
to get that thing under control, quickly. Now please get on with it.  
CONTROL [OC]: Earth control, over and out.  
HOBSON: Well, you're all in the picture. We've got trouble, bad trouble, we
haven't got much time. We're going to run through every circuit, every field
pattern, every damn nut and bolt on Charlie boy in there until he's running
sweet and smooth. A full class A test, in fact. Now you all know what to do so
let's get on with it.  
MEN: Okay, Chief.  
HOBSON: Right, we'll start on the main tape programme.  
BENOIT: Right.

**[Computer room]**

(A proper computer bank, with turning magnetic tapes and stuff.)  
NILS: It's running now.  
HOBSON: Right, give me the analogue value on module 6, will you?  
BENOIT: Will do. They look all right. A at 10 millivolts. B at 15 millivolts,
C at 26. That fits, doesn't it?  
HOBSON: Yes, they're at normal levels. Roger, finish checking here, will you?
The answer may be in the control panel.  
BENOIT: Okay. I'll sing out the binary conversion values, you check them on
read out, okay?  
NILS: Right.  
BENOIT: Right.  
(The Doctor has stuck in and is taking samples of fibres from Benoit's shirt.)  
BENOIT: Channel one.  
NILS: Jah.  
BENOIT: Eight.  
NILS: Right.  
BENOIT: One.  
NILS: Mm-hm.  
BENOIT: Three.  
NILS: Jah.  
BENOIT: Four.  
(The Doctor starts plucking at Benoit's trouser leg.)  
NILS: Jah.  
BENOIT: Six.  
NILS: Right.  
BENOIT: Eight.  
NILS: Right.  
BENOIT: Twelve.  
NILS: Jah.  
BENOIT: Right?  
NILS: Right. All spot on.  
BENOIT: Right.  
(Benoit notices the Doctor and turns on him.)  
BENOIT: Eh là, qu'est-ce que vous fabriquez ici, imbécile d'idiot ! Vous
n'avez rien d'autre à faire ? Vous croyez que nous sommes en train de nous
amuser ? Oh, come on. Get out of the way.  
DOCTOR: Enchanté, Monsieur.

**[Control room]**

BENOIT: Now, where were we? Ah, yes, the fluid servo pressures. I reckon this
is probably where the fault is.  
NILS: Er, do you want them all or just the main tank readings?  
BENOIT: The main will do.  
NILS: Right. Header one, 45 pounds.  
BENOIT: Yes.  
NILS: Header two, 47  
BENOIT: Yes.  
NILS: Three, 42.  
(The Doctor starts unfastening Nils' bootlaces.)  
BENOIT: Yes.  
NILS: Sine values equivalent.  
BENOIT: They all fit. Nothing there.  
NILS: It must be the potentiometer net, then.  
BENOIT: Looks like it. Take us some time to do that. We'll need the digital
voltmeter.  
NILS: Right, I'll get it.  
(Nils steps out of his boot.)  
HOBSON: What the blazes are you doing?  
DOCTOR: I'm just collecting specimens.  
HOBSON: Specimens? Oh, yes. Well, get on with it.

**[Sickbay]**

BEN: We're nearly out of this interferon stuff.  
POLLY: Oh. Well you'd better go and ask Mister Hobson where the rest is.  
BEN: Yeah, right.  
(Ben leaves. Jamie groans.)  
POLLY: Shh. It's all right, Jamie, it's all right. You're going to get better
but you must lie still.  
JAMIE: Oh, what is this place? Is it the home of the piper?  
POLLY: No, we're on the moon. You know, the moon, up in the sky.  
JAMIE: Oh no, I can't be alive. I've just seen the piper.  
(Jamie sits up. The cyberman is standing there. Polly tries to get away but it
fires an electric sounding charge at her head and she collapses.)  
JAMIE: The piper! I knew!  
(The cyberman shocks Jamie unconscious then carries off the man in the next
bed. The Doctor enters with his tray of samples.)  
DOCTOR: Polly! What's happened? Polly. Are you all right?

**[Control room]**

(The place is a hive of activity.)  
HOBSON: Anything out on the probe's servos?  
BENOIT: The error detectors show a slight discrepancy, in normal limits,
though.  
HOBSON: What about the overall feedback valve? We haven't checked that.  
BENOIT: No, that's an idea.  
HOBSON: You know, I don't think it's likely to be a mechanical fault.  
JOE: Mister Hobson, an air pressure drop again.  
HOBSON: Same as before?  
JOE: Yes, just the same. Lasts about five seconds.  
HOBSON: Something's odd. It's not the pumps, I'm sure of that. Has anyone
asked permission to leave the base?  
JOE: No. As far as I know, the compression chamber's empty.  
HOBSON: If I find anybody's been fooling about in there without permission,
I'll tear their hides off.

**[Store room]**

(Bags fall down from a pile against the wall as a cyberman pushes his way in
through a hole before rebuilding the stack to hide it again.)

**[Control room]**

JOE: The pressure's up again now, sir.  
HOBSON: Thank heaven for that. I'm going to check over the control loop
monitor.  
BENOIT: Control loop monitor? Huh. I think you're wasting your time.  
HOBSON: Nothing's a waste of time till we trace this fault, and don't you
forget it! You saw what's happening on Earth. We can't afford to miss
anything. Now get on with it!  
SAM: I think I've found something!  
HOBSON: What is it?  
SAM: One of the probe control antennae.  
BENOIT: Well, what's the matter with it?  
SAM: Well, according to these readings there are at least two pieces of it
missing. It's just not coordinating.  
HOBSON: Missing?  
BENOIT: Meteorites?  
HOBSON: Could be. There could be a simpler explanation. Roger, when did these
people arrive here?  
BENOIT: The end of period 11 in this present lunar day.  
HOBSON: And when did the gravitron start playing up?  
BENOIT: About the beginning of period 12.  
HOBSON: Sam, when was the last time we had anyone outside?  
SAM: During period 13. Two men went outside to realign one of the solar
mirrors.  
HOBSON: That's it.  
BENOIT: I'm not quite with you.  
HOBSON: Well, it's simple. Strangers arrive period 11, the gravitron goes up
the spout period 12.  
BENOIT: I understand. But it can't  
HOBSON: Come on. It's time we put that Doctor and his friend in cold storage.
Just a second. Get two men outside to look at the antennae, will you, Sam?  
SAM: Okay. Right, Joe, nip along to the mess deck, tell Jules and Franz I want
them here pretty sharpish.  
JOE: Right.  
(Ben enters.)  
HOBSON: Well, now what is it?  
BEN: Another patient's gone, sir.  
HOBSON: What? Come on!

**[Airlock]**

(Jules and Franz enter, wearing space suits. They check each other's equipment
then open the doors. They climb ladders, open two more doors and step out.)

**[Sickbay]**

(The Doctor is examining slides on a microscope.)  
DOCTOR: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.  
POLLY: Isn't there any clue at all?  
DOCTOR: No. It's a complete blank. All the tests are negative. As far as I can
see this whole ridiculous place is completely sterile.  
POLLY: We'll have to go and tell Mister Hobson, I suppose.  
DOCTOR: He's not going to like it very much. I simply don't understand it.  
POLLY: Doctor, it wouldn't, I mean it couldn't possibly have anything to do
with Lister, could it?  
DOCTOR: Lister?  
POLLY: Well, I mean, you did say that you took your degree in Glasgow in 1888.
It does seem an awful long time from now, 2070 or whatever it is.  
DOCTOR: Polly, are you suggesting that I'm not competent to carry out these
tests?  
POLLY: Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I was just wondering if there was anything that
Joseph Lister didn't know in 1888 that might possibly help you now.  
DOCTOR: Shh! Somebody's coming. It's Mister Hobson, out for blood. Ours. Look
busy. Quick!  
(Hobson and Ben enter.)  
HOBSON: That's as might be, but that's the third person to disappear in the
past few hours. It's completely illogical. Single beds, no way to get out.  
DOCTOR: Do you mind?!  
HOBSON: What?  
DOCTOR: Would you mind standing away from the door and allowing it to close?
The slides, the dust.  
HOBSON: Okay. It must be you people. We've got some straight talking to do,
you and I.  
DOCTOR: Polly.  
POLLY: Yes?  
DOCTOR: Another boot.  
POLLY: Right.  
HOBSON: Do you hear me?  
DOCTOR: This is extraordinary.  
POLLY: Excuse me, please.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
HOBSON: Now look here.  
DOCTOR: Excuse me, please. We are trying to help you, you know.  
HOBSON: Help? Is that what you call it? You can all get off the moon now.  
POLLY: Now, wait a minute, you said  
HOBSON: I don't care what I said.  
DOCTOR: Ah!  
HOBSON: Found something?  
DOCTOR: I think perhaps I have.  
HOBSON: Really?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I may be onto something, but I must have some room. How can I
work under these conditions? Now out, please! Come along, outside. I'm trying
to work in here! Ben, see that they stay outside.  
(The Moonbase personnel are hustled out.)  
POLLY: Doctor, did you mean that?  
DOCTOR: What?  
POLLY: You've found something.  
DOCTOR: Oh, Polly, I only wish I had. Why not make some coffee to keep them
all happy while I think of something?  
POLLY: All right.

**[Lunar surface]**

(Jules and Franz start checking the antennae when two shadows loom over them.
The cybermen club them to ground, knocking them out.)

**[Outside Sickbay]**

(The Doctor comes out of sickbay.)  
HOBSON: Here, Doctor. You've completed your examination?  
DOCTOR: Yes, just about.  
HOBSON: Turned the base upside down, poked into everything?  
DOCTOR: Yes, clothes, boots, food.  
HOBSON: And you've found?  
DOCTOR: Absolutely nothing.  
HOBSON: Just as I thought.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.  
HOBSON: So what I told you still stands.  
(Polly brings a tray.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, coffee. Splendid. Thank you, Polly. I think we could all do with a
cup.  
HOBSON: Benoit, you'd better go outside and see how Jules and Franz are
getting on.  
BENOIT: Right.

**[Lunar surface]**

(There are two empty space suits lying by the antennae.)

**[Outside Sickbay]**

POLLY: Coffee?  
HOBSON: Well, Doctor.  
POLLY: Sugar?  
HOBSON: Oh, thank you.  
POLLY: It's very hot. Doctor, what about you?  
DOCTOR: Thank you, Polly.  
HOBSON: Well, Doctor, as I was saying, you've had your chance and you've come
up with absolutely nothing. Now I want  
(Number 15 has just taken a mouthful of coffee when he groans and collapses.)  
DOCTOR: Don't touch him! Let me look.  
(Black lines spread quickly across the man's skin.)  
HOBSON: Here, Charlie and you, what's your name, Ben, give us a hand to get
him into the medical unit.  
DOCTOR: Try not to touch his skin.  
(The stricken man is carried away.)  
DOCTOR: Don't drink that!  
HOBSON: What the hell?  
DOCTOR: It's the sugar! Don't you see? That's why the disease doesn't affect
everyone. It's the sugar. Not everyone takes it. No, don't touch it.  
(The Doctor uses forceps to pick up the sugar dispenser.)

**[Sickbay]**

(The Doctor pours some sugar onto a microscope slide.)  
HOBSON: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Just be patient. Just as I thought. A large neurotropic virus.  
HOBSON: What, like the space plague?  
DOCTOR: No. It's a large, infective agent that only attacks the nerves. That's
why the patients have got these lines on their faces and their hands. It
follows the course of the nerves under the skin.  
HOBSON: That's all very well, but how did it get in here?  
DOCTOR: Oh, it is the Cybermen. I believe they have deliberately infected the
base.  
HOBSON: My men have searched every square inch of the base. There's no space
to hide a cat, let alone a Cyberman! Anyhow, how did they get in?  
DOCTOR: One moment.  
HOBSON: What is it?  
DOCTOR: You say you searched all the base?  
HOBSON: Yes. What of it?  
DOCTOR: Every nook and cranny?  
HOBSON: Yes.  
DOCTOR: No chance of anyone hiding anywhere?  
HOBSON: None whatever.  
DOCTOR: Did your men search in here?  
HOBSON: Well  
DOCTOR: Did they?  
HOBSON: Well, there were always people in here, so they probably  
DOCTOR: Did they search in here?  
HOBSON: No!  
POLLY: But there's nowhere in here they could hide.  
(The Doctor round sickbay until they come to a bed where a body is covered by
a blanket, but large silver boots are sticking out.)  
POLLY: Oh, no. No, no, no.  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Back.  
(The cyberman throws back the blanket and leaps out of the bed, weapon ready.
)

__**Episode Three**__

**[Sickbay]**

CYBERMAN 1: Stand back. Stand back from that door.  
(It is a much more mechanical voice than the last time we met them.)  
HOBSON: You're right. It is them.  
(Bob rushes to the cyberman with a metal bar.)  
HOBSON: Quick! Get out of here!  
(A second cyberman appears and fires his weapon.)  
DOCTOR: No!  
(Bob falls, smoke coming from his body.)  
CYBERMAN 1: Remain still.  
HOBSON: You devils. You killed him! An unarmed man.  
CYBERMAN 1: Get up. See that they remain there.  
CYBERMAN 2: Yes.  
(Cyberman 1 uses the transmitter on his chest to contact their ship.)  
CYBERMAN 1: Operational system two now complete. Operational system two now
complete.

**[Space ship]**

CYBERMAN 1 [OC]: Ready to start Operational system three  
CYBERMAN 3: Understood. Operational system three will now begin.

**[Sickbay]**

CYBERMAN 1: You are known to us.  
DOCTOR: And you to me.  
CYBERMAN 1: Silence. Who is in command?  
HOBSON: I am.  
CYBERMAN 1: You will be needed.  
HOBSON: What have you done with my men?  
CYBERMAN 1: They will return.  
HOBSON: They're not dead?  
CYBERMAN 1: No. They are not dead. They are altered.  
BEN: Altered? What have you done to them?  
CYBERMAN 1: They are now controlled.  
HOBSON: If you do anything to my  
CYBERMAN 1: You will do nothing.  
(The second cyberman examines the patients and then gets to Jamie.)  
CYBERMAN 2: This one has not received neurotrope X. Stand back.  
POLLY: Please, leave him alone. His head is hurt. He's had an accident.  
CYBERMAN 2: His head? Then he would be of no value. The others are ready for
conversion.  
CYBERMAN 1: You will now take us to the control centre.  
HOBSON: I'll be damned if  
(The cyberman points his weapon at Hobson.)  
HOBSON: It's through here.  
(Hobson, the cyberman and the Doctor leave.)  
CYBERMAN 2: You will remain here. If you leave you will be converted like the
others.  
(That cyberman leaves.)  
BEN: I don't like that word converted.

**[Space ship]**

(Doctor Evans, Franz and Ralph are being converted. They are all fitted with a
metal headpiece.)  
CYBERMAN 3: Raise your left arm.  
(The three men lift their left arms.)  
CYBERMAN 3: Raise your right arm.  
CYBERMAN 4: Control is excellent. Transfer that one to the capsule.  
(Two cybermen wheel in a man-sized canister. Evans is locked inside it.)

**[Control room]**

BENOIT: It's about time that we heard from those two outside. Let's have a
word with them.  
NILS: All yours, Roger.  
BENOIT: Surface party, come in please. Surface party, come in please. Surface
party, come in. We are not receiving you. Over. Can we see the control antenna
from here?  
NILS: No, Roger. It's just around that first block outside the main port.  
BENOIT: Well, we'll have to send someone else out so get ready to  
(Hobson enters.)  
HOBSON: Get back! Get back! These things are lethal.  
CYBERMAN 1: No one will move. You will remain still. If you move you will be
killed.  
BENOIT: What are they? How did they get in?  
CYBERMAN 1: Silence. We are Cybermen. You will listen.  
BENOIT: But you were all killed!  
CYBERMAN 1: We are going to take over the Gravitron and use it to destroy the
surface of the Earth by changing the weather.  
DOCTOR: But that will kill everybody on the Earth.  
CYBERMAN 1: Yes.  
HOBSON: You're supposed to be so advanced. Here you are taking your revenge
like, like children.  
CYBERMAN 1: Revenge? What is that?  
HOBSON: A feeling people have when  
CYBERMAN 1: Feelings? Feelings? Yes, we know of this weakness of yours. We are
fortunate. We do not posses feelings.  
BENOIT: Then why are you here?  
CYBERMAN 1: To eliminate all dangers.  
HOBSON: But you'll kill every living thing on the Earth.  
CYBERMAN 1: Yes. All dangers will be eliminated.  
BENOIT: Have you no mercy?  
CYBERMAN 1: It is unnecessary. Keep watch on them.  
(Cyberman 1 moves away to activate his communicator.)  
HOBSON: Don't rush him, Nils.  
CYBERMAN 1: Operational system four. Operation system four.  
CYBERMAN 3 [OC]: Operational system four complete. Entry to base now
completed.  
HOBSON: Entry? How did you get in?  
CYBERMAN 1: It was very simple. Only stupid Earth brains like yours would have
been fooled.  
HOBSON: Go on.  
CYBERMAN 1: Since we couldn't approach direct, we came up under the surface
and cut our way in through your store room, contaminating your food supply on
the way. A simple hole, that's all.  
HOBSON: A hole! That explains those sudden air pressure drops we've been
recording.  
CYBERMAN 1: Clever. Clever. Clever.

**[Sickbay]**

(Polly is looking at her battered finger nails as Jamie tries to get out of
bed.)  
POLLY: Hey, what do you think you're doing? You seem to be better.  
JAMIE: Aye, I feel myself again.  
POLLY: Lie back there.  
JAMIE: But I'm better! Oh, my head.  
BEN: Yeah, well take it easy, mate.  
POLLY: At least, you know it's not your McCrimmon piper, anyway.  
JAMIE: It had me worried though, I admit that.  
BEN: Yeah, those Cybermen have got us all worried, mate. We've see them in
action before.  
POLLY: They must have some weakness.  
BEN: They have, don't you remember? They can't stand radiation.  
POLLY: But where do we find that here?  
BEN: There's the Gravitron power pack but that's thermonuclear. No one can get
near it once its going.  
POLLY: Why not?  
BEN: Well because Duchess, the temperature inside is about four million
degrees, that's all.  
JAMIE: Well, in my day, they used to sprinkle witches with holy water.  
BEN: Fat lot of use that would be on them.  
POLLY: Sprinkle. Holy Water. Ben?  
BEN: Yeah?  
POLLY: What are the Cybermen covered in?  
BEN: As far as I know, their suit is a metal of some sort.  
POLLY: Oh. What about that thing on their chests? You know, the part which
replaces their heart and lungs.  
BEN: Some kind of plastic, I think.  
POLLY: I thought so. You see, it's simple. Nail varnish remover dissolves nail
varnish. Nail varnish is a plastic. So we do what Jamie says. We sprinkle
them, see?  
BEN: No, I don't. Clear as mud if you ask me.  
POLLY: Well anyway, I'm going to try an experiment.  
BEN: Yes, Professor.

**[Control room]**

(Ralph, Evans and Jules enter, followed by a cyberman.)  
HOBSON: Jules! Doctor Evans! I thought he was all dead. I thought they were
all dead.  
BENOIT: Better if they were by the look of it.  
CYBERMAN 1: You will leave your places. Go over there.  
(The technicians go to stand by the wall. It speaks to Hobson and Benoit.)  
CYBERMAN 1: You will move. Tell the operators in the power unit to come out.
Now.  
HOBSON: All right, you can all see what's happening. Come out. Leave the
machine and don't try anything.  
(The power control crew enter the control room.)  
CYBERMAN 1: They will now take over the Gravitron power unit.  
CYBERMAN 2: Yes.  
(The converted men file into the power room.)  
BENOIT: But you can't send them in there without the protective helmets.  
CYBERMAN 1: Why?  
BENOIT: The machine produces very intense sonic fields. Without the helmets,
those men will be insane in a few hours.  
CYBERMAN 1: How many hours?  
BENOIT: Twelve, possibly.  
CYBERMAN 1: Then there is no problem.  
BENOIT: Why?  
CYBERMAN 1: Our purpose will be achieved before that.  
BENOIT: But what about the men?  
CYBERMAN 1: They will be disposed of.  
(The Doctor has been watching the cybermen carefully. He edges over to the R/T
unit and turns up the volume, then resets it when a cyberman turns.)

**[Sickbay]**

(Polly has collected lots of bottles.)  
POLLY: Ben?  
BEN: Yeah?  
POLLY: What is nail varnish remover?  
BEN: It's a sort of thinner, something like acetone I think.  
POLLY: Acetone, of course. Great, we've got some of that. Now, keep your
fingers crossed.  
(Polly drops some plastic into the acetone and watches it dissolve.)  
POLLY: It's works!  
BEN: But I still don't know what you're on about.  
POLLY: If we can sprinkle some of that on their chest units, it might help to
soften them.  
BEN: I get it! You mean it'll clobber their controls or something.  
POLLY: Yes, that's it.  
BEN: Yeah, but how do we know that acetone will dissolve their sort of
plastic?  
POLLY: I hadn't thought of that.  
BEN: Just a moment though, if we make up a mixture.  
POLLY: Of all the solvents.  
BEN: What have we got?  
POLLY: Benzene, ether, alcohol.  
BEN: We brew a right old cocktail.  
POLLY: Yes. Wait a minute, how are we going to throw it at them?  
BEN: Well, in bottles, I suppose. Now just a tick though. I've got a better
idea.

**[Control room]**

CYBERMAN 1: Prepare to align the field rectors.  
(The controlled humans obey.)  
CYBERMAN 1: Main power into vortex generators now. Servo pumps to full
pressure.  
HOBSON: Why did they go to so such trouble?  
DOCTOR: What do you mean?  
HOBSON: Why didn't they operate the controls themselves?  
(The Doctor goes back to the R/T unit and adjusts the volume and pitch once
more. The controlled men lose coordination.)  
CYBERMAN 1: What is happening?  
CYBERMAN 2: There is loss of control.  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Thought so. Sonic control. That should be easy.  
(He resets the dials.)  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Funny. Funny. Go to all that trouble to make the men do the
work. Why? Do it themselves, easy. They're using the men as tools. Why? Don't
know. Yes, I do though. There must be something in here they don't like.
Pressure? Electricity? Radiation? Maybe. Gravity! Now there's a thought.
Gravity. Oh, yes. Gravity.  
CYBERMAN 1: Start probe generators. Realign the probe. Probe field to full
power now.  
HOBSON: They'll devastate the whole Earth when that field takes hold.  
BENOIT: We've got to do something.  
CONTROL [OC]: Earth Control calling Moonbase. Come in, please.  
CYBERMAN 1: Remain still.  
CONTROL [OC]: Hello, Moonbase. Come in, please.  
CYBERMAN 1: You will all be silent.  
CONTROL [OC]: Moonbase, come in, please. Hello? Reading on five centimetre
band. Come in. Your last routine signal was not received. Over. We are not
receiving you. Over. If you hear us and cannot transmit, fire sodium rocket.
We shall see flare.  
CYBERMAN 1: What does that mean?  
HOBSON: It's a distress rocket. It ejects sodium into space and then the sun
lights the sodium into a yellow flare.  
CYBERMAN 1: What will your Earth do if they do not see the flare?  
HOBSON: Well, they'll think we're all dead. They'll do nothing.  
CONTROL [OC]: Standing by to observe flare. Standing by.  
(A cyberman turns the transmitter off. Hobson whispers to Benoit.)  
HOBSON: If they don't get our next transmission, they'll send up a relief
rocket.

**[Sickbay]**

BEN: So, get it? This bottle holds the stuff that puts the fire out and this
cylinder pushes gas into the bottle so that stuff squirts out here. Now, all
we've got to do is to undo it. Phoar. Empty it and fill it with Polly
cocktail.  
POLLY: I've got it all ready here.  
BEN: Good. What did you put in it?  
POLLY: Let's think. Benzene, ether, alcohol, acetone and epoxy-propane.  
BEN: Blimey, one of them should do it. Now, we'll need another one of these.  
JAMIE: Right, I'll get it.  
BEN: No, you stay where you are, Jamie.  
POLLY: Jamie, you're not well enough.  
JAMIE: It takes more than a wee crack on the head to keep a McCrimmon down.  
BEN: Look mate, we don't want you cracking up on us. I'm sure Polly's very
impressed.  
JAMIE: Look, I said I was better. Would you like me to prove it to you?  
BEN: Any time, mate.  
POLLY: Look, come on. Haven't we got enough trouble without you two fighting
each other?  
JAMIE: I go.  
BEN: Oh well, come on then. Not you, Polly. This is men's work.

**[Control room]**

(One of the controlled men collapses.)  
HOBSON: You'll kill them.  
CYBERMAN 2: If you will not remain silent you will be put under brain control.  
(The cyberman adjusts his control box and the controlled human jumps up
again.)

**[Corridor]**

BEN: Polly. I thought that I told you to stay behind.  
POLLY: I'm coming with you.  
JAMIE: You'll maybe get hurt. Now go back.  
POLLY: I'm coming with you and that's flat! You still need someone to look
after you  
JAMIE: I don't want  
BEN: There's no time for arguments. If you're coming, come on.  
(They go to the control room door.)  
BEN: Now look, we've only got one chance. When I open the door, drop down as
low as you can, aim this things at their chests and squirt like mad. Right?  
JAMIE: Right.  
BEN: Now get ready.

**[Control room]**

(A cyberman hears something outside.)  
CYBERMAN 2: Someone is there.  
(A high pitched noise makes the controlled men freeze.)  
CYBERMAN 1: The beam is jammed.  
(The cybermen turn on the Doctor as Ben, Jamie and Polly burst into the room)  
BEN: Quickly, go and get their chest things!  
(They spray the cybermen's chest units, which instantly bubble and dissolve.
Clutching helplessly at their chests, the cybermen collapse.)  
DOCTOR: Quick, get these things off their heads!  
(Ben, Jamie and Polly go into the gravitron room and removed the men's metal
helmets. The men pass out.)  
HOBSON: Come on, get to your places! Quick, there's not a moment to lose.
We've got to get the Gravitron down to safe level.  
POLLY: What about those poor men?  
HOBSON: Shift them along to the medical unit, quick as you can.

**[Space ship]**

CYBERLEADER: We are not receiving you. We are not receiving you.  
CYBERMAN 4: They must have failed.  
CYBERLEADER: Yes. We must invade now. Prepare the weapons.  
CYBERMAN 4: Yes.

**[Control room]**

BENOIT: Before all this, we lost contact with those two men outside.  
HOBSON: Well, send someone else out.  
BENOIT: Can't spare anyone. I'll go myself.  
HOBSON: Field strength is stable, isn't it?  
BENOIT: Yes. Yes, it's all right.  
HOBSON: Keep in R/T contract and be quick.  
BENOIT: Right.  
HOBSON: Nils?  
NILS: Jah?  
HOBSON: Hook your controls into Joe's channel, then get up into the dome and
keep a eye on Roger when he's outside.  
NILS: Right.

**[Lunar surface]**

(By the antennae.)  
BENOIT: Hello Base, Hello Base. I've found them. At least, I've found their
suits. They got them, I'm afraid.

**[Control room]**

HOBSON: Well, there's nothing we can do about that now. You'd better come
inside as quick as you can.  
BENOIT [OC]: I will.  
NILS: Sir, sir! There's one of those things outside. He's after Roger Benoit.  
HOBSON: You hear that, Roger?

**[Lunar surface]**

BENOIT: Yes, I did, but he must be mistaken. There's none to be seen around
here.  
(A cyberman appears and draws its weapon.)  
BENOIT: No! No!  
(The cyberman fires his weapon, but nothing happens.)  
BENOIT: Did you see that? Those things don't work in the vacuum!

**[Control room]**

(Ben is dismantling a fire extinguisher.)  
POLLY: Why can't you squirt it at them like you did just now?  
BEN: Because duchess, it would evaporate in the vacuum before it hits them.
There, now come on.  
(Taking the glass cylinder full of solvent mix, Ben runs out. Outside, the
cyberman chases Benoit, gaining on him all the time. At the airlock, Ben gets
into a spacesuit. Benoit approaches the entry door.)

**[Airlock]**

(Ben exits the airlock as Benoit enters. Ben throws the glass cylinder at the
cyberman's chest unit. It breaks, covering him in a cloud of vapour.)  
BEN: Come on, quick.  
(Ben gets back in with Benoit and they close the outer doors. Outside, the
cyberman flails around as it's chest unit dissolves. In the vacuum, no one can
hear it scream.)

**[Control room]**

NILS: They're in! That fellow Ben got one of them.  
JAMIE: That was Ben?  
HOBSON: Now listen, everybody. I don't know how many more of these Cybermen
there are, but our point of view we're under siege. I'll reckon they will be
back in a bit. Now, communications. Charlie, keep trying to get through to
Earth. Right?  
CHARLIE: Right, will do.  
HOBSON: The rest of you, lower the armoured doors at all exits. And you, make
up as much of that gubbins as you've got. We may need it.  
(Ben enters, with Benoit leaning on him.)  
DOCTOR: Well done, Ben!  
JAMIE: Well done.  
HOBSON: Ground radar?  
SAM [OC]: Ground radar speaking.  
HOBSON: Have you got a fix on their ship yet?  
SAM [OC]: Yes, Mister Hobson. We're getting a strong pulse from five four
degrees north about three kilometres.  
HOBSON: That makes it just over the rim.  
DOCTOR: Mister Hobson, how far can the probe be lowered down?  
HOBSON: About thirty degrees.  
DOCTOR: That's no good.  
HOBSON: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: Can any other part of it be lowered?  
HOBSON: Well, the main coil lenses can be shifted round without too much
trouble, but why do you want to do  
NILS: There's something outside, sir!  
HOBSON: What is it?  
NILS: It's a long way off.  
HOBSON: I'll come.

**[Observation dome]**

POLLY: Oh, it's freezing. Do you think we should have our suits on?  
BEN: Oh, no, it's all right love. Get a gorgeous suntan.  
(Hobson looks through the telescope.)  
HOBSON: Can't see anything.  
NILS: Just to the left of the launching area. Round a bit to your left.  
HOBSON: Still can't see anything.  
BENOIT: (pointing) No, it's there, look! Reflections in the sun.  
HOBSON: You're right, there is something.  
(Two rows of cybermen march over the crater rim.)  
HOBSON: It's them. They're coming. Everybody inside, quick!

__**Episode Four**__

**[Observation dome]**

(Hobson is looking through the telescope by the gravitron probe.)  
DOCTOR: They can't just march in here, can they?  
HOBSON: Not now we've discovered how they got in.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes. They tunnelled into the store room.  
JAMIE: Doctor, Mister Hobson, come quickly.  
HOBSON: What is it?

**[Control room]**

CYBERLEADER [OC]: Moonbase. Moonbase.  
NILS: They've got our wavelength. We hear you.  
CYBERLEADER [OC]: You are surrounded. All resistance is useless. You must open
the entry port.  
HOBSON: Let me. You're wasting your time. We've discovered your passageway and
blocked it. You cannot enter now.  
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Resistance is useless.  
(Hobson turns the radio off.)  
POLLY: Can they get in?  
HOBSON: I don't know and I'm not stopping to find out. Get me Earth as quick
as you can.  
NILS: Right. Weather Control Moon calling Earth. Come in, please.  
(Loud static hurts everyone's ears.)  
JAMIE: What's that?  
HOBSON: Switch that off.  
POLLY: What's that terrible noise?  
BEN: It wasn't like that before.  
HOBSON: We'll never hear anything through that if they're jamming it.  
BENOIT: Perhaps, or could it be.  
HOBSON: The aerial. They're having a go at the aerial.  
BENOIT: Where are you going?  
HOBSON: Out.  
BENOIT: You're crazy. They'd get you in a flash.  
HOBSON: Well, someone's got to go.  
DOCTOR: It's too late. Come and see.

**[Observation dome]**

(Through the telescope we see two cybermen destroying the antennae.)  
HOBSON: They get us every way, these creatures.  
DOCTOR: I refuse to believe that. Everything's got a weak point. It's just a
question of waiting until it shows up, that's all.

**[Control room]**

BENOIT: They're bound to send a relief rocket within 12 hours, if no signals
are received from us.  
BEN: A lot of good that is.  
NILS: Well, with all the trouble we've been giving them I'd say it's certain
the rocket is on its way, sent off hours ago. Rinberg's very quick off the
trigger, right, Hobby?  
HOBSON: I'm sure of it. With a replacement for me aboard, no doubt.  
POLLY: But that's wonderful!  
HOBSON: Thanks very much.  
POLLY: No, what I mean is, what are we all worrying about? The Cybermen can't
get in and help is on its way.  
BEN: Ah, it all sounds too easy for my liking.  
HOBSON: Get the scanner lined up on the flight path between moon and Earth.
Let me know the moment you spot anything.  
NILS: Right.  
HOBSON: All we have to do, Doctor, is to hold on here.  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all. It doesn't depend on us, though.  
BEN: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: It depends on what the Cybermen are hatching up. If a rocket is on
it's way, they're bound to be aware of that already.

**[Space ship]**

CYBERLEADER: Emergency. Emergency. There is a spaceship approaching from
Earth. It will arrive on the lunar surface in 15 minutes. Immediate offensive
action must be taken.

**[Lunar surface]**

CYBERMAN: They have blocked up our way into the base. Other methods to gain
entry will be tried.

**[Space ship]**

CYBERLEADER: The machine from Earth must first be destroyed. There are 14
minutes left.  
CYBERMAN [OC]: Understood.

**[Lunar surface]**

CYBERMAN: Transmit control signal.  
(A second cyberman operates a device, which emits a high-pitched whine.)

**[Sickbay]**

(The light above Evans' bed flashes and he sits up. He puts a cybercontrol
device on his head and moves towards the attendant, no 6, Sam Becket, whom he
hits over the head with an object he has picked up.)

**[Lunar surface]**

(The cyberman speaks into the control device.)  
CYBERMAN: You will listen to me and follow my instructions.

**[Control room]**

BENOIT: Switch on again.  
NILS: Without an aerial?  
BENOIT: We can pick up local signals.  
NILS: Local? Oh I see, the Cybermen.  
BENOIT: If they have any more words of cheer for us we might as well hear
them.  
NILS: Right.

**[Sickbay]**

(Evans picks up a weapon.)  
CYBERMAN [OC]: Those are your orders.

**[Control room]**

(Ben is being taught how to operate a console.)  
BENOIT: That is correct, but watch the digital counter.  
BEN: Right.  
HOBSON: How's he shaping?  
BENOIT: Not bad for a beginner, I suppose, but it will take a long time yet.  
HOBSON: Well, at least the gravitron's stable at the moment. I don't know how
they can take it for long in that room.  
BENOIT: How's Benson standing up to it?  
HOBSON: He's  
BENOIT: He's been on for 6 hours on the trot.  
HOBSON: He says he'll be all right for the time being.  
BENOIT: Yes I know, but should he be on it alone?  
HOBSON: Who else have we got? You're the only other operator who could replace
him and you're needed right here.  
BENOIT: Well, it's a bit tough on him, isn't it?  
HOBSON: I know, Roger. It's tough on all of us but the lives of millions of
people depend on this weather control unit.  
POLLY: Here we are. I've brought us all some coffee to keep us awake.  
BEN: Without sugar this time, I hope.  
POLLY: Of course. Don't remind me.  
HOBSON: Take some to the Doctor. He's in the dome.  
POLLY: Right.  
HOBSON: Ben.  
(Polly walks past Evans, who is wearing Sam's tabard and standing by the
gravitron control door.)

**[Gravitron control]**

(Unnoticed, Evans goes into the room and knocks out Benson, then takes off the
man's protective helmet.)  
CYBERMAN [OC]: You will now change field co-ordinates as instructed.  
(Evans puts the helmet on and sits down.)

**[Control room]**

BEN: Doctor! They've spotted it on the scanner.  
DOCTOR: What?  
BEN: The relief ship.  
POLLY: Ben, where?  
BEN: Over here.  
DOCTOR: Let's see.  
HOBSON: Well?  
NILS: No doubt about it. I told you they would be on their way.  
POLLY: That's a spaceship?  
BEN: No, that's the scanner.  
DOCTOR: It's not far off.  
HOBSON: Far off? It's coming in now off parking orbit. It'll be down in six
minutes.  
POLLY: Well, don't you think you ought to warn them?  
BEN: Yeah, the Cybermen will be waiting for them.  
HOBSON: Don't worry, they've got their own warning system and weapons. They'll
blast the Cybermen and their spaceship to kingdom come in about four minutes
from now.  
(The radar blip moves to the centre of the screen.)  
POLLY: Come on, come on. It seems to move so slowly.  
(The blip carries on to the other side of the screen.)  
BENOIT: What are they doing?  
JAMIE: Looks like they've changed direction.  
HOBSON: They've changed into an escape orbit. Follow it.  
NILS: But it's going too fast. I can't keep up with it.  
HOBSON: Well, keep trying.  
NILS: I can't hold it. It's accelerating too fast.  
(The screen goes white.)  
BENOIT: Look out, man. You're on the sun.  
NILS: But that's where it's heading.  
BENOIT: The acceleration, it's gigantic!  
HOBSON: Get R/T contact with the ship.  
NILS: No good, sir. The Doppler effect. It's going too fast.  
BENOIT: They've had it, I'm afraid.  
HOBSON: The sun.  
BENOIT: Yes.  
POLLY: Will somebody please tell us what it all means?  
BENOIT: The rocket has been deflected towards the sun. Nothing can save them
now.  
POLLY: Save them? What are you talking about?  
BENOIT: From plunging into the sun.  
BEN: But the sun's millions of miles away.  
BENOIT: Once they get into the sun's gravity belt they can't change course. It
may take a week but they'll end up there just the same.  
HOBSON: What on earth could have caused it?  
BENOIT: The rocket was deflected off course, but why and how?  
DOCTOR: Deflected? Yes, of course. The gravitron.  
HOBSON: Have the Cybermen got a gravity weapon, do you think?  
DOCTOR: No, they haven't but we have.  
HOBSON: You're not suggesting that  
DOCTOR: There's only one way that rocket could have been deflected into the
sun. From this very room!  
BENOIT: I see what you mean.  
HOBSON: Of course, the gravitron. Benson, he must  
BENOIT: I told you he'd been on duty too long.  
DOCTOR: If it is Benson.  
(They look through the gravitron control room. Evans turns around.)  
HOBSON: It's Evans!  
BEN: But he was in the medical room!  
DOCTOR: They must have got control of them again.  
BEN: And the other men in there?  
DOCTOR: They may not be affected yet. Get along to the medical room. Barricade
the door with everything you can find. Keep them in there at all costs!  
JAMIE: Right.

**[Sickbay]**

(The other men are being activated. Number 10 and two others get up.)

**[Outside Sickbay]**

JAMIE: Well, that's all right. We haven't passed any of them.  
BEN: Well, maybe it was only Evans who's been reactivated.  
JAMIE: Aye. We'd better keep watch just here.  
BEN: We could stick that thing against the door  
JAMIE: It wouldn't hold them for long, I'm thinking.  
BEN: They're not Cybermen, mate. They're just flesh and blood like us. Come
on, get hold of the other end.  
(They start to carry the metal table when Jamie drops his end.)  
BEN: Hey!  
JAMIE: Behind you!  
(A man starts to walk through the door.)  
BEN: Quick! Ram him!  
(Number ten get the thin metal rammed into his stomach. He falls back.)  
BEN: Press the locking button.  
JAMIE: It won't hold for long, will it.  
BEN: No. Look, get those chairs and we'll block 'em in.  
(The controlled men use a strip of metal to prise the doors apart.)

**[Control room]**

HOBSON: Evans, can you hear me? Listen, Evans, this is Hobson talking. Evans,
you've got to concentrate. Your brain has been altered by the Cybermen. You're
being controlled by them, anyhow. We've got one or two of those things as
well, you know. You can't shoot all of us so why not be a good fellow and come
out of there.  
BENOIT: What's he doing in there? Look at the field reactors.  
HOBSON: Huh?  
BENOIT: We must get back control soon. He could flood half of Europe if he
keeps the gravitron aligned with spring tides.  
HOBSON: That settles it, we'll have to rush him. Get those weapons out.  
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Resistance is useless. All further ships from Earth will be
deflected. Open the airlock to us. If you do not we shall destroy the base and
you will be eliminated.  
HOBSON: Can you hear me?  
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Everything you have said in the past half hour has been
overheard.  
HOBSON: Well you can hear this too, then. We're not done yet and we'll fight
you to the last man. You'll never get inside this base.  
CYBERLEADER [OC]: We are in it already.  
(There's a bang and everyone clutches their throats and hangs on as the air
rushes out.)  
HOBSON: They've punctured the dome!  
BENOIT: The oxygen masks! Quick everyone, take a mask. Over there.  
(Nils, Ben and Jamie get to a set of three masks in the ceiling. The Doctor
has got one at the console Polly is hanging on to.)

**[Observation dome]**

(The dome is cracking.)  
BENOIT: I do hope we don't lose too much oxygen.  
HOBSON: Can we patch it, do you think?  
BENOIT: We can try.  
HOBSON: Give me a hand off, will you?  
(Benoit helps Hobson take off his lab coat.)

**[Control room]**

POLLY: Doctor, I can't breathe!  
(The Doctor tries to pass her a mask.)  
DOCTOR: Put this on your face.

**[Observation dome]**

(Hobson and Benoit plug the crack with the coat.)  
HOBSON: Oh, thank heavens. I can breath again.  
(The coat starts to get sucked through the hole.)  
BENOIT: Oh no!  
(The coat is sucked through the hole and flies across the moon.)  
HOBSON: Is there anything else we can patch it with?  
BENOIT: No, nothing. Wait. Over there.  
(It's the coffee tray.)  
HOBSON: Slide it to me but don't let go of it. We have to do it in one action.
No second chance. Okay, ready?  
BENOIT: Oui.  
HOBSON: Now!  
(This firmly blocks the hole and the pressure gauges rise again.)  
HOBSON: Stopped them for the moment.  
BENOIT: I wonder for how long.  
HOBSON: Well, let's have a look.

**[Control room]**

DOCTOR: Polly! Are you all right?  
POLLY: Oh yes. Oh. Oh, where's that air coming from?  
NILS: Reserve tanks of oxygen.  
POLLY: Oh. Well why couldn't we have had those before?  
NILS: And lose all our oxygen?  
POLLY: Oh, I see. It's so quiet.  
DOCTOR: Yes, it is, isn't it. The gravitron's stopped!  
(Evans is slumped over the console.)  
DOCTOR: Quick, before he comes to! Ben, Jamie!

**[Gravitron control room]**

NILS: Joe!  
BEN: We've barricaded the sick bay with half the tables and chairs in the base
but it won't hold forever, Doctor.  
(The Doctor takes the helmet and control piece off Evans.)  
DOCTOR: Well done, Ben. Here's another one for you.  
**[Control room]**

JAMIE: What do we do with him, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: That's your problem. Just make sure he doesn't come back here for a
while.  
BEN: Blimey, I'll be after a job as a copper when I get back to 1966.  
(Ben and Jamie leave with Evans. The Doctor puts the control device inside his
coat.)

**[Observation dome]**

DOCTOR: Mister Hobson, I've got an idea.  
HOBSON: Doctor, what do you make of this?  
DOCTOR: Made by a laser beam, I would think.  
HOBSON: Is there anything known to science the Cybermen haven't got?  
DOCTOR: Well they haven't got a gravitron or they wouldn't be after yours.  
HOBSON: We'll just have to stand guard in here with their cyberguns.  
BENOIT: Not much use, I'm afraid. They are getting reinforcements.  
HOBSON: What?  
BENOIT: Looks like another of their spaceships.  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, there.  
(A classic flying saucer lands.)  
HOBSON: Another one!  
(And a second.)  
CYBERLEADER [OC]: We have brought up reinforcements with other weapons. You
have one chance. You must open the entry port. You cannot stop us now. You
will all be completely destroyed.  
POLLY: What does he mean, other weapons?  
NILS: We'll soon find out. You stay here. I must report this to Mister Hobson.  
(Nils leaves Polly in charge of the R/T.)

**[Lunar surface]**

(Cybermen are unpacking crates.)

**[Space ship]**

CYBERLEADER: I shall count to ten. If you still stupidly remain silent. we
shall fire. One

**[Observation dome]**

NILS: Hobby! They've got another weapon. They're going to  
HOBSON: Yes, I know. There it is. Everybody take cover. Get down, all of you!  
(The Doctor stays standing.)  
HOBSON: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Is the gravitron still switched on?  
HOBSON: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Then I shall certainly stay here.

**[Lunar surface]**

(A group of cybermen aim a weapon at the base.)  
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Nine, ten. Fire.  
(A beam goes towards the base then 'bounces' off it. For some reason, this
cyberweapon has recoil. Don't ask. )  
CYBERLEADER [OC]: Again. Fire.  
(Once again the beam bounces off the base.)

**[Observation dome]**

HOBSON: What happened?  
DOCTOR: It just deflected over the dome.  
(The Doctor sways.)  
BENOIT: Doctor, are you all right?  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course.  
HOBSON: The gravitron deflected it. The force field.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and that gives me an idea. What are they doing now? They're
packing it away.  
HOBSON: What'll they cook up next, I wonder?  
DOCTOR: How far down can this be aimed?  
HOBSON: Down?  
DOCTOR: Can it be brought to bear on the surface of the moon?  
BENOIT: I see!  
HOBSON: Ah, well, I don't  
DOCTOR: Has it ever been tried?  
BENOIT: No, but we should try!  
DOCTOR: With Evans gone, the gravitron is all yours.  
BENOIT: Splendid! Je m'en occupe!  
HOBSON: It can only go to here. Any further down and the field may affect the
base.  
DOCTOR: What does that matter now?  
HOBSON: Well, I suppose you're right.  
DOCTOR: Get someone to stand by that window and relay instructions direct to
Benoit.  
HOBSON: Right.  
(Benoit puts on a helmet and goes into gravitron control. Polly is by the
window to relay instructions. Thumbs up are sent.)  
HOBSON: He's ready.  
DOCTOR: Start moving the probe down.  
(The message is relayed. The approaching cybermen stop advancing and spread
out. They draw their weapons. Benoit signals that the gravitron won't go any
lower.)  
HOBSON: That's as far as it'll go.  
DOCTOR: What? But it's way over their heads. There's one chance. We'll try
bringing it down by hand.  
HOBSON: Right.  
DOCTOR: Is this still switched off?  
HOBSON: Yes, it's off.  
DOCTOR: Round the back.  
HOBSON: It won't go.  
DOCTOR: All your weight, once more. No, it's no use, it won't shift.  
HOBSON: Ah, stupid of me. Of course it won't.  
DOCTOR: Why?  
HOBSON: Well, the angular cut out. It's obvious, isn't it. You see, there's
got to be a safety cut out on the angle of the probe otherwise it might affect
the whole base. There, that's done it. No, no, no, stand back. Benoit can do
it now.  
DOCTOR: Polly!  
HOBSON: Switch on!  
(As the gravitron comes down to level with the moon's surface, the cybermen
start to float up and away, followed by their saucers. Big cheers from the
assembled team.)  
DOCTOR: We did it!  
HOBSON: Well, that's taken care of the Cybermen. Now then, everybody, we've
got to get this gravitron in operation again as fast as we can.  
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry we damaged it.  
HOBSON: What? Oh, yes.

**[Control room]**

HOBSON: Nils, rig up a temporary aerial. Call up Space Control. Tell Rinberg
we will be operational in er, oh about two hours. He won't like it but it's
the best we can do.  
NILS: Right.  
HOBSON: Two hours, that's all we've got to get the world's weather back under
control again. Benoit, take charge of your side.  
(Meanwhile, the Doctor, Ben, Polly and Jamie quietly leave.)  
BENOIT: Right.  
HOBSON: And Doctor, what the? Oh well, perhaps it's just as well. We've got
enough madmen here already. Now come on, I want to see your first weather plot
in two minutes.  
BENOIT: Right, come on boys.

**[Lunar surface]**

(Safely suited up, the travellers take a last at the Moonbase before
approaching the Tardis doors.)  
POLLY: Doctor, look.  
(A comet-like object is streaking through space.)  
POLLY: Could that be them?  
DOCTOR: Possibly. And I hope it's the last we see of them.  
(They all enter the Tardis and it dematerialises.)

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: There we are. In perfect flight.  
POLLY: Yes, and look what happened last time.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that. What a lot of fuss. Just a bumpy landing, that's all. It
won't happen again. I know.  
BEN: What are you up to now?  
DOCTOR: Let's have a look at the time scanner.  
POLLY: The what?  
DOCTOR: The time scanner. Instead of the normal picture showing where we are,
it gives you a glimpse of the future.  
JAMIE: The second sight? Very dangerous.  
DOCTOR: Oh nonsense. I haven't used it very much. It's (cough) not very
reliable, as you can see.  
POLLY: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
POLLY: Look!  
(The scanner shows an image of a giant claw.)
