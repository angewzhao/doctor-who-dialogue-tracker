__**Episode One**__

**[Ioniser control room]**

(It is a land of glaciers, crevasses and massive icicles. In the hi-tech
control room, workers in plastic tunics and knee-high boots rush around
turning dials on the four curved control panels surrounding a circular central
computer interface.)  
ANNOUNCER [OC]: This is a preliminary warning. Preliminary warning. Prepare
phase one base evacuation procedure. Phase one evacuation.  
(Clent enters, leaning on a walking stick in his right hand. Say Hi to  Peter
Barkworth, everyone.)  
CLENT: Why has the ioniser been allowed to deteriorate to danger level?  
GARRETT: (woman) There was a power stoppage. I've done all I can to boost it.  
CLENT: Well, it can't be allowed to fall any lower.  
GARRETT: We still have time to evacuate.  
CLENT: We will certainly not evacuate. We've beaten its tantrums before.  
GARRETT: It's falling again.  
CLENT: Well, hold it! You must hold it steady.  
GARRETT: I can't.  
CLENT: Switch the stabilising circuits through to computer control.  
GARRETT: I have. It's still not holding!  
CLENT: All circuits, woman. All circuits!  
GARRETT: We're nearly there.  
CLENT: There's not enough power.  
GARRETT: It's slowing down.  
CLENT: Maybe it'll hold there.  
GARRETT: I doubt it.  
CLENT: Well, at least it gives us time.  
GARRETT: We need Scientist Penley.  
CLENT: He is no longer a member of this post. You will make this machine work.  
GARRETT: Yes, Leader Clent.  
CLENT: That's better.  
GARRETT: Emergency evacuation phasing set.  
WOMAN: Yes.  
GARRETT: Ioniser state fault check.  
WOMAN 2: Yes.  
GARRETT: Reactor safety sequence in operation. Good.  
CLENT: You'll make an Organiser First Class yet, Miss Garrett.  
GARRETT: I only follow your example, Leader Clent.  
(Clent sits at the central unit.)  
CLENT: What is the latest report from all other ioniser bases?  
COMPUTER: All bases are in phase. America, glaciers held. Australasia,
glaciers held. South Africa, glaciers held. Asia, some improvement claimed.  
CLENT: They would.  
COMPUTER: Britannicus Base Europe, slipping out of phase. Glacial advance
imminent.  
GARRETT: If we fail, the whole programme for glacier containment is in danger.  
CLENT: I'm fully aware of that fact.  
GARRETT: But in two hours the ioniser will be useless.  
CLENT: And then the glaciers will move again. Five thousand years of history
crushed beneath a moving mountain of ice.  
ANNOUNCER [OC]: Phase two evacuation. Emergency. Phase two evacuation. Red
state emergency. Red state emergency.  
CLENT: Priority override.  
GARRETT: Yes, of course. But Penley was the expert.  
CLENT: I've had enough of experts and their crazy ideas. Where's Arden?  
GARRETT: Still at the ice face, completing the instrumentation project.  
CLENT: Well, hasn't he been warned?  
GARRETT: We couldn't get through. Surface communication's impossible when  
CLENT: Well, we have to tell him immediately. I cannot lose any more men.
Leader Clent to Scientist Arden at glacier face. Come in, Arden.

**[Glacier face]**

(These men are also dressed in plastic suits, but with metal helmets and
goggles too. Very appropriate for arctic conditions I don't think.)  
ARDEN: Walters, drill here. Now clear that trench, Walters, while I prepare
the seismograph probe.  
WALTERS: Sir. Get your drill ready, Davis. Sir!  
ARDEN: Yes?  
WALTERS: Come quickly, sir!  
(Walters rubs snow off a wall of clear ice.)  
WALTERS: I could swear there's something inside.  
ARDEN: Oh, not another mastodon.  
WALTERS: Well, look for yourself, sir.  
ARDEN: Is it a man?  
WALTERS: Perhaps it's an animal.  
ARDEN: Well, we'll soon find out. Davis, the heavy drill.  
DAVIS: Yes, sir.  
(Walter's wrist-com beeps.)  
WALTERS: Base calling, Sir.  
ARDEN: What do they want?  
WALTERS: There's nothing coming through. Poor reception. I suppose they  
ARDEN: They'll have to wait. This is more important. Come on, Davis.  
WALTERS: Well, what are we going to do, sir?  
ARDEN: Do? Excavate. This could be a brilliant discovery.  
WALTERS: But, sir, the computerised schedule. We must stick to that.  
ARDEN: Oh, must we?  
WALTERS: Leader Clent will be furious, sir.  
ARDEN: Well, that's just too bad. For once we'll do something on our own
account, eh?  
WALTERS: There's not much base can do about it, sir. After all, we can't even
ask permission, can we?  
ARDEN: Come on, Davis. Hurry, man!  
(ARDEN wipes away more of the snow)

**[Ioniser control room]**

CLENT: Arden, for heavens sake man, come in! This is urgent!  
(But the screen is full of static. He gives up.)  
GARRETT: Failing again. (something) is decreasing. Not far from total
disintegration.

**[Outside the base]**

(Snow piles up against the modular base walls, and the remains of dead trees
stick out of it. The Tardis materialises on its side on a pile of snow, then
slides down with the roof pointing to the ground. There are screams and
squeals from inside. Someone pushes at the doors.)  
JAMIE [OC]: Up you go.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Just got to get my hand there.  
JAMIE [OC]: You can. Now the other one.  
(The Doctor emerges, wearing his fur coat.)  
JAMIE [OC]: Argh!  
DOCTOR: What's the matter?  
JAMIE [OC]: You're on my head!  
(The Doctor falls back inside. Victoria squeals. The Doctor clambers out
again.)  
JAMIE [OC]: Careful.  
DOCTOR: Up you come. There we are. Come on, Victoria. Give me your hand.  
(All three are leaning on the Tardis 'doorstep'. Victoria has put a fur-
trimmed velvet cape over her tweed jacket.)  
DOCTOR: It was a blind landing.  
JAMIE: Is that what you call it?  
VICTORIA: Well, no broken bones. Hey, look at the snow.  
JAMIE: Oh no, not again. Tibet was bad enough, but I think you've put us down
just further up the mountain.  
DOCTOR: Well, let's see, shall we? Very careful. I'm going to get out. It's
quite a long drop.  
JAMIE: Up you go.  
DOCTOR: Come on, Victoria. That's right.  
VICTORIA: Hey, it looks like a great big wall of ice.  
(The Doctor's eyes pop out of his head.)  
JAMIE: What is it?  
DOCTOR: You're on my hand!  
VICTORIA: But Doctor, look.  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's not ice, that's plastic.  
JAMIE: Yes, and see how smooth it is, and curved.  
DOCTOR: Yes. It's a dome. A protective dome.  
(Jamie shuts the Tardis doors.)  
VICTORIA: It's so big. Can't see the end of it. Wonder what's inside.  
(A door in the dome opens and a scruffy man in furs comes out. The travellers
duck down behind the Tardis. A second scruff comes out carrying boxes.)  
PENLEY: Don't worry. Those alarms weren't meant for us. I wonder what's wrong,
though.  
(Everyone say Hi! to  Peter Sallis.)  
STORR: (Scots) Aye, that's their problem. Come on.  
(The two men leave and the travellers go to the now-shut door. A wolf howls
nearby. The Doctor waves his hand in front of a panel and the door opens. On
the opposite wall is a picture of a street with colonnaded shops. They go in
and the door closes behind them.)

**[Ioniser control room]**

GARRETT: Leader Clent, the video! Arden has made contact.  
CLENT: Arden, can you hear me?  
ARDEN [on monitor]: Yes. What is it?  
CLENT: You must return to base immediately.  
ARDEN [on monitor]: Well, don't panic. I've almost finished setting up the
seismograph probes. Davis, hurry up.  
CLENT: Yes, but the ioniser's nearly at disintegration point.  
ARDEN [on monitor]: Oh, I wonder if Penley's ears are burning.  
CLENT: It's not a laughing matter, man! You know what it means.  
ARDEN [on monitor]: Yes. Cold weather ahead. I thought it felt a bit nippy.  
CLENT: There'll be a full enquiry into your delay, you realise that.  
ARDEN [on monitor]: Yes, and I've got a very good reason. A fantastic
discovery in the ice.  
CLENT: Your task was to set up movement probes in the ice, not indulge in
amateur archaeology.  
ARDEN [on monitor]: This is a man!  
CLENT: Oh, congratulations. Makes a change from fossils. Now leave it and
return.  
ARDEN [on monitor]: I'm bringing the body back with me.  
CLENT: Arden.  
ARDEN [on monitor]: I'm sorry, I can't hear you. There seems to some
interference.  
CLENT: Arden!

**[Corridor]**

(They could easily be in a stately house. A female torso statue in an alcove,
ornate Regency-style chairs and side tables, portraits on the wall.)  
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor, it's just like my home.  
DOCTOR: I know!  
JAMIE: We could be  
ANNOUNCER [OC]: Red state emergency. Evacuation phase three. Phase three
evacuate. Transport section leaders report now. Phase three evacuation.  
DOCTOR: Something's wrong.  
VICTORIA: It seems safe enough.  
(A woman walks towards them.)  
DOCTOR: We're discovered.  
(She pins labels on the travellers.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.  
JAMIE: Thank you. Excuse me, miss, I'm Jamie McCrimmon, do you think you could
tell us where we are?  
(The woman walks away.)  
DOCTOR: She doesn't want to know, Jamie.  
VICTORIA: Hey, this says we're on evacuation flight seven.  
DOCTOR: Rather inhospitable. We've only just arrived.  
JAMIE: Hey, and this tag, it says I'm a scavenger. And yours does too! Here,
we're not beggars.  
DOCTOR: Hush, Jamie.  
VICTORIA: What is it Doctor?  
(The Doctor listens at a door.)  
DOCTOR: It sounds like electronic machinery. Like a computer. There's
something wrong with it's pitch.  
VICTORIA: Oh, no. Now look, it might be dangerous. Now let's leave it.  
DOCTOR: No.  
VICTORIA: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Let's go in.

**[Ioniser control room]**

(Clent is making notes on a pad.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, there's something very wrong here.  
CLENT: Now is (something) still out of phase? Seven two point four.  
DOCTOR: Seven two point four? That's bad.  
(The Doctor follows Clent around the control desks.)  
CLENT: Now balance those gauges, Miss Henry. 17 degrees out of norm.  
DOCTOR: 17 degrees? Well, this is serious!  
CLENT: Miss (something), report to me  
GARRETT: level will you? Minus one seven degrees.  
CLENT: One three seven-nine.  
DOCTOR: One three seven nine? Excuse me, I  
CLENT: Who the blazes are you? Get these scavengers out of here, quick!  
DOCTOR: No! We're not scavengers!  
(General shouting as security try to grab the Doctor's coat.)  
DOCTOR: No! In two minutes thirty eight seconds, you're going to have an
almighty explosion! The readings say so!  
CLENT: Well how can you possibly know that? I haven't even, I haven't even
processed them through the computer yet!  
DOCTOR: I don't need a computer.  
GARRETT: If he's right it's already too late to escape.  
DOCTOR: No, it isn't. It doesn't have to happen. If you'll excuse me.  
(The Doctor runs round the control desks, giving instructions.)  
DOCTOR: Cut out the reactor link for a start! Uncouple the transformer unit.
(something) the density phase and power.  
GARRETT: There's insufficient power for that.  
DOCTOR: Well, a quick short burst then from the reactor unit, now. Off! Now
link the circuits with the reactor link. Now, bring in the computer
stabiliser. Yes, that should hold it steady. It's not a perfect job, mind you.
You ought to get an expert in, you know.  
CLENT: How did you? It was all a bluff, wasn't it, that two minutes thirty
eight seconds to danger.  
DOCTOR: Oh no, it was near enough correct. Give or take a second.  
CLENT: Rubbish.  
DOCTOR: Check it on your precious computer then.  
CLENT: Miss Garrett, do so.  
(Garrett reads Clent's notes to the central terminal.)  
GARRETT: Ioniser fall rate, seven two point four. Ion compensator, minus one
seven degrees. Ion flow rate, one three seven nine. Assessment please.  
COMPUTER: Immediate emergency. In two minutes thirty seven seconds, the
reactor will explode.  
DOCTOR: Well, a second out. We can't all be perfect.  
GARRETT: We're at half power now, Leader Clent.  
CLENT: Why, even Penley couldn't have done better. Where on earth did you
spring from? It doesn't matter. Now look  
(Clent wobbles and puts his hand to his head.)  
DOCTOR: What's the matter?  
GARRETT: Are you all right?  
CLENT: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, no, it's nothing. It's just an emergency
added to a ten hour duty spell.  
GARRETT: The vibro-chair.  
CLENT: Yes, you're right. Contact the Medi-Control centre the moment there's a
further downward fluctuation. We'll talk at the same time, come with me. (he
leaves the room)  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, Jamie, (something)  
JAMIE: Ask him where we are.

**[Glacier face]**

(There's a sort of humanoid inside the ice, towering above the men.)  
ARDEN: A giant among prehistoric men.  
WALTERS: See the kind of armour he's got on?  
ARDEN: Yes, that's rather strange. He looks pre-Viking. But no such
civilisation existed in pre-historic times, before the first ice age.  
WALTERS: Proper Ice Warrior, isn't he, sir? I reckon Leader Clent'll be
interested.  
ARDEN: Yes. What'll the mighty computer make of it, ay?  
WALTERS: Sir, hadn't we better get back while the weather still holds?  
ARDEN: Good point, Walters. Davis, try bringing the air-sled a little closer,
will you?  
(Davis walks out into the storm, watched by Storr and Penley, sheltering in
another finger of the glacier face.)  
STORR: What are they up to?  
PENLEY: Arden's found something in the ice. Something to take back to Clent.
It won't be appreciated.  
STORR: Aye, they ought to leave way alone.  
PENLEY: Arden was always a researcher. He wanted to be an archaeologist when I
knew him.  
STORR: Archaeology. What good's that?  
PENLEY: It's good to know things, even when they're dead.  
STORR: Nothing's sacred to you, is it?  
PENLEY: I only ask questions. It's in my character, I suppose.  
STORR: Aye, you swore you'd give all that up.  
PENLEY: Discovery is as exciting to me as the hunt is to you. But with Clent,
he uses scientists craniums as stepping stones for his ambitions.  
STORR: Aye, that's about all you lot are fit for. Door steps.  
PENLEY: Well we're not totally useless, surely?  
STORR: To me you are. Come one, we've got to move. Leave them to their stupid
games.  
(Penley and Storr walk out into the storm, then take cover as Davies is coming
back. He looks up as a wall of snow falls off the ice face above him.)  
WALTERS: Avalanche! Come on!  
PENLEY: Look out! Avalanche!  
(Davis is swept off his feet and down into a crevasse in front of the glacier
face.) PENLEY: Storr, are you alright?  
STORR: Penley.  
PENLEY: What's the damage?  
STORR: My arm. It's gone, I think.  
PENLEY: Broken?  
STORR: Feels like it.  
PENLEY: Well, you're lucky. There's one down there who's staying on the
mountain for good.  
STORR: They'll come looking for him. We must move out a bit. Unless you fancy
trying to turn me over to your friends.  
PENLEY: Six weeks ago they were my friends, but not any more. Can you walk?  
STORR: Aye. Just you try and keep up. Come on.  
WALTERS: All clear, sir.  
ARDEN: Yes, but how about Davis?  
WALTERS: I'll go look for him.  
ARDEN: Well, let's hope he's safe. With another man gone, Clent'll skin me
alive.  
WALTERS: Well, if he gets too difficult, you can always set your warrior on
him, hey, sir?

**[Medi-control centre]**

(Clent is reclining on a chair. There is hi-tech equipment scattered around
and bookshelves line the walls.)  
CLENT: But you've no valid proof of your qualifications?  
DOCTOR: Look, aren't we wasting time? If you want our help, why not tell us
all about it?  
CLENT: All about it? All about what? Where have you been all these years?  
DOCTOR: Well, as a matter of fact, we've been in retreat. In Tibet. We are
sanctifiers.  
CLENT: Oh, I see. In Tibet. Well, if you'll take a simple test, I'll soon know
if you're up to our scientific standards.  
DOCTOR: I see. And if I fail?  
CLENT: You'll be evacuated with the other scavengers in due course.  
JAMIE: Oh, where to?  
GARRETT: The African rehabilitation centres, of course.  
VICTORIA: Oh, no, not Africa.  
DOCTOR: Very well, fire away.  
CLENT: I present you a problem. All the major continents are threatened with
destruction under the glaciers of the second ice age.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
CLENT: How would you halt the ice surge and turn the climate back to normal?
Forty five seconds starting from now.  
(Garrett starts the countdown.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, possible causes. The reversal of the magnetic field.  
CLENT: No such change has occurred.  
DOCTOR: Interstellar clouds obscuring the suns rays? An excessive burst of
sunspot activity. A severe shift of the Earth's angle of rotation.  
VICTORIA: Come on, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: There aren't that many alternatives. Gigantic heat loss?  
CLENT: I asked for an answer, not a question. Twelve seconds left.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, well, in that case the answer's simple. A severe drop in the
carbon dioxide level in the Earth's lower atmosphere. Is that it?  
I would use ionisation.  
(The timer goes ding!)  
JAMIE: Well, is he right?  
(Clent stands up.)  
CLENT: Yes, he is.  
VICTORIA: Oh. But I still don't understand.  
DOCTOR: Well, the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's atmosphere helps retain
the sun's heat. Take that gas away, and there's a sudden freeze up.  
JAMIE: Oh, where does the gas go to?  
DOCTOR: Well  
CLENT: You know how efficient our civilisation is, thanks to the direction of
the great World Computer. And you also know how we conquered the problem of
world famine a century ago by artificial foods.  
(Clent gets himself one of these from a dispenser.)  
CLENT: On the land that was once used to grow the food we needed, we built up
to date living units, to house the ever-increasing population.  
DOCTOR: Up to date?  
CLENT: Well, there were exceptions, of course. I mean, this house was
classified as being of historic interest. So, the amount of growing plants on
the planet, was reduced to an absolute minimum.  
DOCTOR: No plants, no carbon dioxide.  
CLENT: Then suddenly, one year, there was no spring. Even then it wasn't
understood. Not until the ice-caps began to advance.  
JAMIE: But, what's this ioniser?  
CLENT: Miss Garrett.  
GARRETT: Ionisation is a method of intensifying the sun's heat onto the Earth,
but into particular areas.  
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's like a magnifying glass, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Oh, aye.  
VICTORIA: You mean you can melt glaciers and change the weather?  
CLENT: When certain difficulties are overcome.  
GARRETT: Precise control is not easy.  
CLENT: We can't afford to make mistakes. Ionisation can produce temperatures
intense enough to melt rock.  
GARRETT: Only by maintaining a perfect balance can we prevent widespread
flooding.  
DOCTOR: Can't your computers solve the problem of control?  
GARRETT: Of course they can.  
DOCTOR: Well.  
GARRETT: When the imprint data is complete they will give us the solution.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. And when will that be?  
GARRETT: Soon, Doctor, soon.  
DOCTOR: What's the position now?  
CLENT: Well, we're barely holding the glacier in check. Now, there you see a
world map of the situation at the moment. And there you see what's going on in
our sector. But if we fail, then not only will Europe be swallowed up, but the
balance of power will be ruined, and the whole world programme will go under.  
DOCTOR: And the glaciers will win. I see.  
CLENT: My senior scientist, Penley, is missing. I think you have the
capabilities to join us here in this great mission. Will you help us?  
DOCTOR: Well I'm willing to try.  
CLENT: Jolly good. Jolly good. Miss Garrett will give you some background
information. You've worked with computers, I presume?  
DOCTOR: Only when I have to.  
GARRETT: Well, Miss Garrett is our computer specialist. She'll help you.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I'll try and remember that.  
GARRETT: Here we are completely computerised.  
DOCTOR: Well, never mind.  
GARRETT: Every decision is checked to eliminate risk of failure. Because of
course, all decisions, all actions, must conform to the common good.

**[Corridor]**

(Arden is leading the way, and the ice-encased Warrior is being brought along
on a gurney.)  
ARDEN: This way, gentlemen, this way. Right. Now do be careful. Around here.
Steady with her.

**[Medi-control centre]**

(Clent is on the vibro-chair when Arden brings his prize into the room.)  
CLENT: Is this what you call your full co-operation, Arden? How do you expect
us to carry out this  
JAMIE: There's something in it.  
CLENT: Great heavens.  
ARDEN: Yes, I thought you'd be impressed Clent. Right, chaps. Let's have him
over here. Curtain up. This way. Head this way, tail down there.  
VICTORIA: What is it?  
JAMIE: It looks like a Viking warrior. Look at the helmet.  
DOCTOR: Frozen for centuries in the ice. Perfectly preserved. Ooo, that's odd
though.  
JAMIE: What?  
ARDEN: Who are you?  
CLENT: An addition to our staff, Arden. What's odd, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Well the helmet, it's wrong. When this man was frozen to death only
primitive cavemen existed.  
ARDEN: Well I say it's an undiscovered civilisation. Think of the
implications.  
CLENT: Well, whatever the implications, it must still take second place to out
ioniser project. We have our daily planning conference in three minutes
fifteen seconds exactly. Come along, Arden! Play with your toy after the
meeting.  
(Clent, Garrett and Arden leave.)  
JAMIE: Well, what's supposed to happen, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: You see, this fellow Arden has set the electricity so that the ice
melts very slowly, allowing for the resistance.  
VICTORIA: It's working quite quickly.  
DOCTOR: Well, I suspect there are some impurities in the ice. I say. Look at
that.  
JAMIE: What is it?  
DOCTOR: It's an electronic connection. I'm sure of it.  
VICTORIA: It can't be.  
DOCTOR: Now you wait here, and don't touch anything.  
(The Doctor turns a dial and leaves. The curtain comes back down blocking the
ice off from the rest of the room.)  
JAMIE: What's got into him all of a sudden?  
VICTORIA: I don't know. Scientists are all alike. Eureka and all that.  
JAMIE: Aye. He could do with a go on this, maybe.  
(Jamie lies on the vibro-chair. Behind the curtain, chunks of ice are quickly
falling off a very non-human figure with no fingers on its hands.)  
JAMIE: Victoria?  
VICTORIA: What?  
JAMIE: You see how those lassies were dressed?  
VICTORIA: Yes, I did. And trust you to think of something like that.  
JAMIE: Well, I couldn't help thinking about it.  
VICTORIA: Well, I think it's disgusting, wearing that kind of thing.  
JAMIE: Oh, aye, so it is, so it is. You don't see yourself dressed like that
then?  
VICTORIA: Jamie!  
JAMIE: Oh, I'm sorry. It was just an idea.  
VICTORIA: We will now change the subject, please. I want to look at this man.  
(Behind the curtain, the warrior flexes his rubber claw, opens his mouth and
moves his head. It's alive!)

__**Episode Two**__

**[Medi-control centre]**

VICTORIA: Jamie!  
(Hissing, the Warrior overpowers Jamie and takes Victoria away with him.)

**[Ioniser control room]**

CLENT: He took just forty five seconds to propose ionisation. No prior
knowledge.  
ARDEN: Well, it took us and the Academy of Scientists years.  
GARRETT: The computer took three milliseconds.  
ARDEN: Yes, well, we had to programme it first.  
CLENT: Quite. Well, before I make a final decision, I want the computer's
assessment on this Doctor.  
GARRETT: We must be absolutely sure.  
CLENT: State the work potential and community value of the Doctor.  
COMPUTER: More information is necessary for a full evaluation. High IQ but
undisciplined for our needs. Present evaluation, to be used on research
projects, but could be obstructive in certain situations.  
(The Doctor enters.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are.  
CLENT: Doctor, would you mind  
DOCTOR: I've been looking everywhere. Why don't you label your doors?  
CLENT: Yes, this is a private meeting.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I realise that, and I'm sorry.  
CLENT: And we have not yet completed our business.  
DOCTOR: Look, I wouldn't intrude if I didn't think it necessary. What I have
to say is extremely important. After all, you did ask me to help you, didn't
you?  
ARDEN: Has something happened to the warrior?  
DOCTOR: Well, it has something to do with that, yes.  
CLENT: We have more serious matters on hand.  
DOCTOR: This is serious!  
ARDEN: Now let him tell us, Clent. Well?  
DOCTOR: Thank you. It's the, it's the helmet. It's not what we thought it was.  
CLENT: It's a prehistoric drinking cup.  
DOCTOR: No! It has electronic connections.  
CLENT: E? What are you talking about?  
ARDEN: But that's impossible. You must be mistaken.  
DOCTOR: No, I'm positive. You realise what this means?  
ARDEN: Well it must mean the civilisation he came from must be more advanced
than we thought.  
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed. They even had astronauts, it appears.  
CLENT: How do you mean?  
DOCTOR: This headpiece is no warriors tin-hat. It's a highly sophisticated
space helmet!  
CLENT: Aren't you jumping to conclusions, Doctor, for a scientist?  
ARDEN: But if this is true?  
DOCTOR: If this is true your project is in danger.  
CLENT: In what way? How can one preserved body, however old, effect us?  
DOCTOR: How did he get here? Well, he didn't walk, did he?  
CLENT: Well, if what you say is true, by spaceship.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and where is that spaceship now?  
ARDEN: In the glacier. Then it must still be intact. He had no signs of
mutilation. He couldn't have crashed. He must of landed. Clent, can't you see
the importance of such a discovery?  
CLENT: The propulsion unit of the spacecraft is probably  
GARRETT: Probably atomic powered.  
CLENT: Quite. And, er, if we use the ioniser at full power  
DOCTOR: This reactor pile could be exploded or be activated.  
CLENT: But if we don't  
GARRETT: The whole area will be contaminated.  
CLENT: But if we don't use the ioniser, what then? We are part of a world
plan. Now, if we hold back that plan cannot go into operation.  
GARRETT: We could hold it at minimal power.  
CLENT: Not good enough.  
ARDEN: No, we daren't take the risk. The contamination level would last for
five decades or more.  
CLENT: It merely makes the fine control of the heat level even more vital.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I thought you ought to know.  
CLENT: Yes, you were right, thank you. I must inform the computer immediately
for its decision.  
ARDEN: Well, we shall need more facts.  
CLENT: Well, furnish me with facts then!  
(Jamie enters.)  
JAMIE: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Jamie!  
JAMIE: The warrior's come alive!  
ARDEN: Alive?  
CLENT, DOCTOR + GARRETT: What?  
JAMIE: He's taken Victoria. I couldn't stop him!  
ARDEN: Alive. and I found it.

**[Medi-control centre]**

CLENT: Alive?  
DOCTOR: Strange.  
CLENT: How did it happen?  
JAMIE: Well, we were just talking, and I turned, and there he was standing
right next to us.  
ARDEN: That's impossible. To be preserved, yes, but to come alive? Impossible.  
DOCTOR: For a human being, maybe.  
ARDEN: What, not human?  
DOCTOR: Look at this table.  
CLENT: Well, it's been burned.  
ARDEN: Well, I used a low voltage especially.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but a high current.  
ARDEN: Yes but it was quite safe.  
DOCTOR: But if that current passed through a low resistance.  
GARRETT: Extremely high temperatures.  
CLENT: The intense heat must have shocked him back into life.  
JAMIE: Oh look, I don't know what you're all talking about, but all I know is
Victoria's in danger and what are we doing to save her?  
DOCTOR: Yes Jamie, you're right. Come on. She can't have gone far.  
JAMIE: Well, come on then.

**[Ioniser control room]**

CLENT: Danger red alert, danger red alert. Intruders within perimeter. Capture
and control. Priority one. Repeat to all posts.  
JAMIE: But within a perimeter? But supposing they're way out of it?  
ANNOUNCER [OC]: Danger red alert, danger red alert. Intruders within
perimeter. Capture and control. Priority one.  
CLENT: Well, that'll be just too bad. Obviously I can't release men for an
extensive search outside the base.  
DOCTOR: But she may be in danger of her life! You can't take that decision!  
CLENT: Very well. You want an impartial opinion? I shall ask the computer.  
JAMIE: Oh, not the computer.  
DOCTOR: It's a waste of time asking the computer.

**[Storage room]**

VICTORIA: Who are you?  
VARGA: (hissing) Varga.  
(Believe it or not, that is  Bernard Bresslaw underneath all that fibreglass.)  
VICTORIA: Where are you from?  
VARGA: From the Red Planet.  
VICTORIA: Mars? We thought you were dead and then you came alive. What
happened?  
VARGA: Too many questions.  
VICTORIA: I'm curious, that's all.  
VARGA: I need answers from you.  
VICTORIA: I don't think I can help you very much.  
VARGA: Answers.  
VICTORIA: Is that a gun?  
VARGA: How long was I in the ice?  
VICTORIA: I don't know, I. One of the scientists said you must have been there
since the first ice age. Thousands of years ago.  
VARGA: That cannot be true.  
VICTORIA: Were there others with you?  
VARGA: Yes. Our spaceship crashed at the foot of the ice mountain. As we came
out to investigate, a great avalanche of snow buried us.  
VICTORIA: Then the others are still trapped in the glacier, then.  
VARGA: I will free them. Then we will return to the Red Planet.  
VICTORIA: How? You can't get them out by yourself.  
VARGA: You will help. How was I brought to life?  
VICTORIA: Let the scientists here on Earth help you.  
VARGA: Tell me! They would not help me. They would keep me as a curiosity, and
they would leave my warriors for dead, or destroy them.  
VICTORIA: No. No, they, they wouldn't.  
VARGA: But with my men, I can talk from strength. Then we shall decide.  
VICTORIA: Decide? Decide what?  
VARGA: Whether to go back to our own world, or to conquer this.

**[Ioniser control room]**

CLENT: All relevant factors now presented. How should we act?  
JAMIE: Och, how's a machine to know?  
DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie, have patience. Give it a chance.  
COMPUTER: Ionisation programme should continue as planned. A limited number of
lives are expected to be lost.  
JAMIE: What about Victoria, though?  
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie.  
COMPUTER: However, the suspected presence of an alien spacecraft must be
investigated, in case of potentially fissionable material.  
JAMIE: Spacecraft! Hey, do you reckon that's where the warrior's gone back to?  
DOCTOR: Well, he didn't come by Shetland Pony, Jamie.  
COMPUTER: In order to accommodate this priority the workload has been
rescheduled to free one scientist investigator.  
CLENT: Who should be released?  
COMPUTER: Scientist Arden.  
CLENT: Well, Arden, do you think you could handle this ice giant single-
handed?  
ARDEN: Well, I shall need at least one guard.  
JAMIE: Well, what about me then? I could go with him.  
DOCTOR: Yes, he's a capable lad.  
CLENT: Well, the computer said one investigator only.  
DOCTOR: That was from your staff, Jamie's extra.  
JAMIE: Aye.  
GARRETT: The mission must be carried out. The computer has ordered it.  
CLENT: As the Doctor has agreed to help us with the ioniser. Yes, very well,
the boy can go.  
DOCTOR: Oh good.  
CLENT: But you must leave immediately, because the sooner we know whether
there is a reactor buried inside that glacier or not, the better.  
JAMIE: Aye, maybe, but Victoria's important too, you know.  
CLENT: You don't seem to realise, boy, the fate of the world could be at
stake. The girl must take her chance.

**[Plant museum]**

STORR: What ye trying to do? Cripple me?  
PENLEY: You know the trouble with you. Storr? You're just stupid.  
STORR: How was I to know it would get infected?  
PENLEY: If you'd listened to me in the first place.  
STORR: Aye, you'd have stuffed me to the eyeballs with anti-this and anti-
that. I'd have been flat on my back for weeks.  
PENLEY: Where as now, you're fighting fit.  
STORR: Ach, well, someone has to do things.  
PENLEY: Mmm. Well, that someone isn't going to be you.  
STORR: Ach, it's nothing. I'll pull through.  
PENLEY: Yes, I'm rather afraid you will. But if you don't do what I say you'll
soon be in a coma, which at least would give me a bit of peace.  
STORR: Don't try scare me with all that scientific guff.  
PENLEY: I'm just telling you, Storr. You got a headache?  
STORR: Ach, it's nothing.  
PENLEY: What I like about you is if a polar bear got you you'd give him
indigestion. Feeling fuzzy in the head, eh?  
STORR: I will not let it beat me. Is it going to be bad?  
PENLEY: You won't know much about it.  
STORR: My mouth's dry.  
PENLEY: Here's a what do you call it? A tomato. It's nearly ripe.  
STORR: Ach, you shouldnae have done that. I've been waiting weeks for that to
ripen properly.  
PENLEY: Take it, it'll do you good.  
STORR: Ach.  
PENLEY: Well, there are advantages to living in a plant museum, even this
close to the glacier.  
STORR: Ah, so even a scientist can appreciate it then?  
PENLEY: Well, there's warmth and food. Selected ancient food plants. Tomatoes,
carrots, potatoes, strawberries. A world out of Atlantis.  
STORR: Aye, helps me picture how it was before they killed off all the plants.
There was spring then, and flowers. You could pick the fruit off the trees.
Now you rotten scientists (coughs) drop down dead.  
PENLEY: Even so it's not the nicest way to live.  
STORR: Aye.  
PENLEY: An avalanche waiting on your doorstep.  
STORR: Not leaving here until I have to.  
PENLEY: Granted.  
STORR: You're not going out after food, are you? You wouldn't know what to do
without me. Where are you going, anyway?  
PENLEY: Well I've learnt enough from you to take care of myself, and it's for
your idiotic sake that I'm going.  
STORR: Where to?  
PENLEY: The base.  
STORR: You're going to hand me in to rehabilitation. Africa. Never trust
anybody.  
PENLEY: I'm going for drugs. And if I don't get them, you're as good as dead.

**[Storage room]**

VICTORIA: It's, it's, it's, it's a  
VARGA: Go on.  
VICTORIA: It's a black box with wires. They connected it to you, and you came
alive. I, well, I don't know how!  
VARGA: A power source. Resistance. A great heat and then life. This room we
came from. We will go back to it.  
VICTORIA: I'll tell you how to get there.  
VARGA: You will take me there. Without that power unit, my warriors are
lifeless.  
VICTORIA: But we have to go down the corridors. Supposing someone sees you?  
VARGA: I shall kill them. And you.  
VICTORIA: Me?  
VARGA: If you call for help.  
VICTORIA: What is that?  
VARGA: Sonic gun. It will burst your brain with noise.

**[Glacier face]**

JAMIE: There's no one been here. There's not a mark.  
ARDEN: Well, we didn't pass them on the way. Now, stand aside lad, will you?  
JAMIE: We were wrong, then. He's lost out there somewhere, Victoria with him.  
ARDEN: I can't get a reading. There's something inside there, but all it's
doing is creating havoc with this radiation sensor. Arden calling Leader
Clent. Arden calling Leader Clent, answer please.  
CLENT [on screen]: Clent here. Report.  
ARDEN: There's no sign of the fugitive or the girl. They didn't, couldn't have
come this way.  
CLENT [on screen]: That was not the purpose of your mission. Please report
correctly.  
ARDEN: No reading obtainable. The sensor is being jammed by some sort of a
screening device. I can't make head nor tail of it.  
CLENT [on screen]: But something is in there.  
ARDEN: Correct.  
CLENT [on screen]: Well, come on then, man! Don't waste time. Go in and find
out what it is!  
ARDEN: Well, not with the equipment I have with me now.  
CLENT [on screen]: Very well then, return at once. The mission will be
repeated with the correct equipment.  
ARDEN: But this is the proper equipment for the job.  
CLENT [on screen]: Obviously not. Don't waste time. Return immediately. Out.  
JAMIE: A nice boss you've got there.  
ARDEN: Yes. The trouble with Clent is that he's not a proper scientist, he's
an organiser. He should've been born a robot.  
JAMIE: Let's go on.

**[Corridor]**

VICTORIA: No, no, it's not in there. It's further down the corridor.

**[Medi-control centre]**

VARGA: The black box. Find it, quickly.

**[Ioniser control room]**

GARRETT: It's still on half power, but it's holding well.  
CLENT: Good. Well?  
DOCTOR: Well, I still think you ought to get in an expert. Why can't you get
one?  
CLENT: I choose not to.  
DOCTOR: But why?  
CLENT: You're not here to question me.  
DOCTOR: No, I'm here to help you, if I choose.  
CLENT: This is the most important job I've ever had. Now, every other project
I've handled with ease. Nothing has failed. I was chosen because I never fail.
When I handpicked the team, I made one vital mistake.  
DOCTOR: This chap Penley.  
CLENT: Best man in Europe for ionisation studies. As it turned out, hopelessly
temperamental.  
DOCTOR: Temperamental or individual? Creative scientists have to be allowed
some head you know.  
CLENT: Creative? Poppycock. When he walked out of here he proclaimed himself
to be criminally, criminally irresponsible.  
DOCTOR: It couldn't have been just a simple gesture of protest?  
CLENT: He was always protesting. This is a team, a team with a mission. If we
fail, others cannot succeed.  
DOCTOR: And your name will suffer. That's important.  
CLENT: I lead the team. I depend on the experts I picked. My judgement was
sound. Others won't see it that way.  
DOCTOR: So you do need Penley.  
CLENT: No, I do not need Penley. But I do need an equivalent brain. But it
would be months before anyone else could pick up the knowledge that Penley
acquired here. Just isn't time, that's the pertinent issue.  
DOCTOR: Well, I'll try and help you, but I do think you might try trusting
human beings instead of computers.  
CLENT: I trust no one, Doctor. Not any more. Human emotions are unreliable.
I'll just go and see that the working area reserved for you in the Medi-
Control Centre is ready.

**[Medi-control centre]**

VARGA: The power pack.  
VICTORIA: I'm looking!  
(Something falls and she jumps.)  
VICTORIA: Yes, yes, they look like the one. Yes, yes.  
VARGA: You are coming with me, to the ice mountain.  
VICTORIA: No, please.  
(Clent enters.)  
CLENT: Who are you?  
(Varga knocks out Clent.)  
VICTORIA: You killed him!  
VARGA: Come.  
(Varga and Victoria leave. Penley comes out of hiding and the Doctor enters.)  
PENLEY: I er, I was going to give him this.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's disgusting. It's just the thing. Did you do this?  
PENLEY: I've come very close to it at times. I've never seen him look so
peaceful.  
DOCTOR: Oh, he'll be all right. Did you see who did do it?  
PENLEY: Yes. A monstrous looking creature. I didn't like the look of him at
all.  
DOCTOR: Was there a girl there?  
PENLEY: Yes, she seemed scared stiff.  
DOCTOR: Well, why didn't you try and stop them?  
PENLEY: Well, I came here to get some drugs for a man who is sick. I couldn't
run the risk of getting caught.  
DOCTOR: But she's only a young girl!  
PENLEY: She's alive. My friend will die if I don't get back.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I see.  
PENLEY: Are you going after them? I can take you part of the way.  
DOCTOR: No, no, they're searching already. There's a red alarm all over the
base.  
PENLEY: Well, I've got what I want. I'm off.  
DOCTOR: Penley?  
PENLEY: You know about me then. My escapades in computer-land.  
DOCTOR: They need you here, you know. They need you desperately.  
PENLEY: Needing isn't getting. I'm free of their problems for good.  
DOCTOR: They're your problems too, you know. It's your world.  
PENLEY: My world is up here. Private and no admittance. Well, I'm going to go
then.  
DOCTOR: I expect you know what you're doing.  
PENLEY: You know it's nice to meet one that they haven't got at yet.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.  
PENLEY: Goodbye.  
DOCTOR: Goodbye.  
(Penley leaves. The Doctor puts the smelling salts under Clent's nose.)  
GARRETT [OC]: They're in here.  
(Garrett, Jamie and Arden enter.)  
DOCTOR: Where's Victoria?  
GARRETT: Leader Clent!  
ARDEN: What's happened?  
CLENT: Where are they?  
GARRETT: I've just had a message from the perimeter gate. He smashed his way
through, taking the girl with him.  
CLENT: He knocked me out with a power pack.  
DOCTOR: With a power pack? You mean the one that you used to unfreeze him?  
CLENT: Yes. And he and the girl have many more.  
ARDEN: To revitalise others like himself.  
CLENT: Others? What do you mean. We don't know that there are others.  
JAMIE: Well now, he'll head for the glacier. Let's get way after him.  
DOCTOR: No. That's what he wants us to do. That's why he's taken Victoria with
him as a hostage. No, we must let him show his hand first.  
JAMIE: But we can't just stand around waiting?  
DOCTOR: We're not going to. Only until morning. That'll be time enough.  
CLENT: No, now! Must I remind you of the mission that you have yet to
accomplish?  
ARDEN: Oh no, Clent, not at night. Not for you or anybody. You've never been
out there at night.

**[Glacier face]**

(Varga uses a tracker to find his men in the ice.)  
VARGA: I have located my warriors. When your friends come after us, they will
find a surprise.  
VICTORIA: What are you going to do?  
VARGA: You'll see. Don't try to run away.  
VICTORIA: I was only going to watch you.  
VARGA: You are going to help me.  
(Varga uses his sonic gun to melt the ice.)

**[Plant museum]**

PENLEY: Twenty four hours and you'll be your old animal-like self again. And
while you're undergoing repairs, Storr, old chap, I'm going to do a bit of
hunting myself, up on the glacier. Something strange is happening, Elric
Penley, honoured sir. That warrior, that girl, that funny, scruffy looking
chap. Something strange indeed. Something disturbing. Something to do with the
ice. And if what that particular chap has said is true, if they really need
me, it may mean the parting of the ways for us.

**[Glacier face]**

VARGA: It's done. They are free. And now, to bring them back to life.

__**Episode Three**__

**[Glacier face]**

VARGA: See, it is working. Zondal is coming to life. Zondal. Zondal. Zondal.

**[Ioniser control room]**

JAMIE: Wish me luck, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: You take care of yourself, Jamie, and keep an eye on Arden. I don't
think he quite realises how dangerous this creature is.  
JAMIE: After what's happened here? He must be blind.  
DOCTOR: Well, he's a scientist and a bit inclined to have his head in the air.
You know what they're like.  
JAMIE: Aye, I certainly do.  
ARDEN: Are you all ready, lad?  
JAMIE: Aye, let's away.  
DOCTOR: Good luck.  
ARDEN: Now we don't know how many of them there are, so we'll have to tread
carefully.  
CLENT: You will not expose yourself to any unnecessary violence, Arden?  
ARDEN: Now listen, Clent, we both know that I'm responsible for what has
happened. If I hadn't brought that creature back here in the first place, none
of this would have occurred. I also caused the death of Davis. I can't forget
that, either.  
CLENT: Well, you just remember your mission, that's all. And no wild sorties
after the girl. It's vital that you get your information back to us
immediately.  
JAMIE: Look, we'll not leave Victoria to the warriors, if that's what you
mean. If there's half a chance of us two  
CLENT: You will take your orders from Scientist Arden! Act according to your
priorities, Arden.  
ARDEN: Come along, boy.  
CLENT: Arden?  
ARDEN: Yes?  
CLENT: Don't be to too hard on yourself. Scientists must question, you know. I
mean, if I'd been in your shoes I think I'd have done the same. I'd have, I'd
have brought it back. So, anyway, good luck.  
DOCTOR: Good luck, Jamie!  
JAMIE: And you, Doctor.  
(Arden and Jamie leave.)  
CLENT: Well, Doctor, let's see you go into action. I'll just get Miss Garrett
to take you over the set-up here.  
DOCTOR: Miss Garrett? Oh, no, no. There's no need to go into formalities.  
CLENT: Miss Garrett? I like things done properly. Where is she?  
DOCTOR: Now Clent, just remember I am not a member of your staff. I'm just a
working guest, as you might say.  
CLENT: Yes, of course. But this is a formal establishment, and our regulations  
DOCTOR: Your regulations do not apply to me. I work in my own way, freely.  
CLENT: I see. Like Penley. Regulations seemed to bother him, too. Probably
caused his eventual breakdown, in fact.  
DOCTOR: Breakdown? I thought you said he defected?  
CLENT: Did I? Well, one thing lead to another, naturally. He was under a great
deal of pressure. Just too much for him, that's all.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I see.

**[Plant museum]**

STORR: A creature growing out of the ice! Bah!  
PENLEY: I assure you that what I saw was very real. And terrifying.  
STORR: You've been out on the mountain too long. It takes some people that
way. Especially the brainy ones.  
PENLEY: Hmmm. Very well, don't believe me, but I still intend to find out.  
STORR: Ah well, you can leave me out of your fun and games. I've got enough
troubles of my own.  
PENLEY: You're fit enough now. To do the cooking, at least. Thanks to science.  
STORR: Science! Och, it wasn't science, it was just good plain doctoring. And
if you smirk again like that, I'll crack your head open with this.  
PENLEY: Yes, you're definitely back to your normal witty self. What's the
matter?  
STORR: Someone's outside.  
PENLEY: They must have tracked me here from the base. Hide yourself. We don't
want you carted off to Africa yet. You!  
GARRETT: I followed you. It's all right, I'm alone.  
PENLEY: What do you want?  
GARRETT: Elric, we're in desperate trouble at the base. You're the only one
who can help us.  
PENLEY: Clent doesn't need me. All he wants is a mirror. Preferably rose-
tinted.  
GARRETT: He does need you to make the ioniser work again.  
PENLEY: Is that all?  
GARRETT: No. He's faced with having to report the full situation to World
Control.  
PENLEY: Oh well, now we're coming to it, aren't we? The great Clent would have
to admit failure. That's it, isn't it? Poor old Clent. He never could face the
music. Here, what about this creature at the glacier?  
GARRETT: That's only part of our trouble. The real problem is the ioniser.
Will you come?  
PENLEY: It's typical of him to send you, instead of armed guards.  
GARRETT: He doesn't know I'm here. I'm asking you.  
PENLEY: I won't come.  
GARRETT: But you can't just step aside. A man like you, living like a
scavenger? It's utterly wrong. Civilisation needs you.  
PENLEY: Jane, I chose this existence. I chose it because I refuse to be sucked
into that computerised ant-heap you call a civilisation. I'm a man, not a
machine. I will not return.  
GARRETT: Not even to save the world?  
PENLEY: Save the world? Well, that has a fine Clentian ring to it. No thanks,
no. It'll take more than me to do that. But don't you worry, you don't get rid
of my sort all that easily. Machines corrode and rust, but mankind goes on.
You'll find Clent one of these days in a museum, like that ancient stove, with
an inscription round him. Robotised human mark two, now extinct. But you'll
find others like me still alive.  
GARRETT: Surely, Elric, that's all the more reason to come back. To change
things.  
PENLEY: Don't you understand, Jane? Clent's just a talker. He's a glib
political animal. Even if I did change things, the Clent's of this world would
still come out on top. Running things according to their own whims and
indulgences. And the pity of it is, they believe they're right.  
GARRETT: Then you leave me no alternative. You will come, and now!  
PENLEY: You must be desperate. But tranquillising me isn't going to make it
any easier. You'd never be able to carry me all that way.  
STORR: Oh no you don't!  
GARRETT: Who's this?  
PENLEY: Just a friend. Now what are you going to do?  
GARRETT: Return to base and wait for the inevitable disaster.  
STORR: Oh no, you don't. I'm not having you set the dogs on me. I'd as soon
put an end to her game. Give me that.  
PENLEY: Storr, no. She won't put us away.  
GARRETT: No, I won't.  
STORR: I don't trust any of them.  
GARRETT: Please trust me enough to come with me to safety. Apart from the
danger of the glacier, these creatures.  
PENLEY: Oh yes, your ice warriors. Well, we shall just have to take our
chance. No, I won't return. And now you must go. But if Sir Genius does have
trouble with the ioniser, look up my notes on the Omega factor.  
GARRETT: Thank you for that at least.  
(Garrett leaves.)  
STORR: This ice warrior. It's real then.  
PENLEY: Oh yes. And I'm going up there again.  
STORR: But why, man?  
PENLEY: Because I must know. Now, put this knife to more sensible use.

**[Glacier face]**

VARGA: If you value life, obey, and do not anger us.  
VICTORIA: I want to go back to my friends.  
VARGA: Perhaps later. For the moment, you are useful to us. Zondal.  
ZONDAL: Commander.  
VARGA: You will locate our buried spaceship without delay.  
ZONDAL: That will not be difficult.  
VARGA: You will excavate sufficient space to form a cave.  
ZONDAL: A cave.  
VARGA: To act as a trap.  
VICTORIA: A trap? Who for?  
VARGA: Do not interfere. Your friends may attack us.  
VICTORIA: But they don't want to attack you. They could help you.  
VARGA: We do not need help.  
VICTORIA: You'd still be frozen and dead if it wasn't for us.  
VARGA: You are a child.  
VICTORIA: Oh, why won't you listen?  
VARGA: Commence.  
VICTORIA: What are you going to do with me?  
VARGA: Bait. Bait for the trap.  
ZONDAL: Activate direction sensors. Steady. Sonic stalls ready. Set to wide
impact. Take aim. Continuous fire!

DOCTOR: If I was to reverse the sequence to give a density ratio. Where did I?
Yes, here we are. If I reverse the sequence to give a density ratio. Excuse
me. Excuse me! Yes.  
CLENT: Genius at work, I see. Good morning Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Mmm? Yes.  
CLENT: Well, this is all very impressive, Doctor, but don't you think it'd be
simpler to use a computer?  
DOCTOR: Four. What computer?  
CLENT: The base computer.  
DOCTOR: Six. Yes, they're useful for digital analysis, but I very rarely use
them, except when I have to. There is one thing you could do for me which
would be very important.  
CLENT: Yes, yes, anything. What is it?  
DOCTOR: Lend me a pencil. Oh, that would be even better.  
CLENT: Doctor, would you mind explaining just what it is that you are  
DOCTOR: Now, this is wrong, this is wrong. It's not right. There's something
missing.  
CLENT: Would these figures help?  
DOCTOR: Supposing I? What are they?  
CLENT: Data readings from the other bases.  
DOCTOR: Oh, computer checked, I hope?  
CLENT: Of course.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank heavens for that.  
(Garrett enters.)  
GARRETT: Doctor, I've found something here that I think you might  
CLENT: Where have you been, Miss Garrett? Your instructions were to help the
Doctor, were they not?  
GARRETT: Yes, Leader Clent. I have been looking up Scientist Penley's notes.
These. Could these help?  
DOCTOR: What are they? Omega. Well, what does he mean? Omega. What does he?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Yes! Yes, of course. The Omega Factor! There and
here and there. Yes! Ha ha! Your friend Penley is very clever.  
CLENT: Is that it?  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's it!  
CLENT: That's fantastic.  
DOCTOR: Oh, when you've been at it as long as I have it's nothing.  
GARRETT: Do you think it could possibly work?  
CLENT: It's very possible.  
DOCTOR: Possible? It's perfect! Well, it's nearly perfect.  
CLENT: We shall see.  
DOCTOR: Oh, it'll work, all right.  
CLENT: The computer will confirm that, I'm sure.  
DOCTOR: Computer?  
GARRETT: Well, everything's checked.  
DOCTOR: I resent that!  
CLENT: Just normal practice, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: It should be the other way round.  
CLENT: We have to be quite sure. It'll only take a matter of seconds. Copy all
this down, Miss Garrett, and then we can feed it through the computer and do a
simulator run. I'll just go and set it up.  
DOCTOR: I shall demand an apology, you know.  
GARRETT: We may not have time for that.  
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad you had time to look up Penley's notes.  
GARRETT: I thought it might be useful.  
DOCTOR: Pity that he turned traitor.  
GARRETT: Oh, Clent might call him that, but he's still the most brilliant
scientist we have.  
DOCTOR: Oh? Oh, it's nice to see he still has some friends in the base.

**[Glacier cave]**

ARDEN: Glacier task unit. Leader Clent, please. Leader Clent, please.

**[Ioniser control room]**

CLENT: Clent here. Report.  
ARDEN [on monitor]: We've arrived at the glacier site. There's something
strange.  
CLENT: What is?  
ARDEN [on monitor]: The ice face. It's been excavated into a cave.  
DOCTOR: How?  
ARDEN [on monitor]: By some kind of tool, I think.  
CLENT: Is there any sign of a spacecraft?  
ARDEN [on monitor]: Yes.  
DOCTOR: There is? Where?  
ARDEN [on monitor]: Well, at the back of the cave, there's what looks like a
metal door in the ice.

**[Glacier cave]**

ARDEN: The place is apparently deserted.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Well make sure you don't go too near.  
CLENT [on monitor]: Excuse me. Take the necessary readings, and leave quickly,
Arden.  
ARDEN: I'll take care.  
JAMIE: What readings?  
ARDEN: Radiation, magnetic field and ion density. Won't take long.  
JAMIE: I don't fancy this place.  
ARDEN: There's never been such a discovery as this. All my life  
(An ice warrior shoots Arden and Jamie.)  
VICTORIA: No! Oh Jamie, no! What have you done to him? You killed them!  
VARGA: It was necessary.  
VICTORIA: Oh, you're monsters!  
VARGA: Remove her inside.  
VICTORIA: Oh, leave me alone! Oh, please. Haven't you done enough? Please,
leave me alone! I want to go back! Please!  
ZONDAL: There may be more of them.  
VARGA: If more of them come, we will destroy them. If no more of them come, we
will know there are not enough of them to resist us.  
ZONDAL: Let us destroy the girl now.  
VARGA: They came after her. She is obviously of some value to them.  
ZONDAL: Then they will try again.  
VARGA: We shall be ready for them. But first, Zondal, you have a task to
complete. The propulsion unit. It must be made to function. Time is vital. You
must succeed.  
ZONDAL: Yes, Commander.  
VARGA: Come.  
(Penley creeps out of hiding and drags Jamie away.)

**[Ioniser control room]**

CLENT: We've just finished programming the computer. We shall have the result
very quickly.  
DOCTOR: Isn't it about time that Arden and Jamie reported again?  
CLENT: Yes, that's true. But you know what Arden is, with his scientific
curiosity.  
DOCTOR: Yes, very human. I'm worried about them too.  
CLENT: Yes, I'll do it if you don't mind. Leader Clent calling Scientist
Arden. Arden? Do you receive me?  
DOCTOR: He's not answering. Perhaps something has happened to them.  
CLENT: It looks as if he's. Arden. For heaven's sake man, come in!

**[Glacier cave]**

DOCTOR [on monitor]: Jamie, answer me! Jamie, what's happened? Jamie! Jamie!

**[Ioniser control room]**

DOCTOR: I will never forgive myself if anything's happened to Jamie.  
CLENT: What about this project with Arden missing?  
DOCTOR: Oh, your ioniser will work all right.  
CLENT: I hope so. I'm not sure that I trust your judgement yet, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: What do you mean, I'm only human? Well as a matter of fact  
(Garrett enters.)  
GARRETT: It works!  
DOCTOR: I told you it would.  
GARRETT: The equation works!  
DOCTOR: I told you it would.  
CLENT: Good. Good. Jolly good. Success is at last possible. Inform all ioniser
bases, Miss Garrett. Thank you, Doctor. It's a triumph.  
DOCTOR: Very likely. But somewhere, out on that ice face, are two young people
for whom I have considerable affection. That is no triumph!  
CLENT: I appreciate your feelings. I, too, have lost a colleague.  
DOCTOR: They're not colleagues, they're friends.  
CLENT: We cannot be sentimental in this situation, Doctor. Our mission
continues. We must all play our part.  
DOCTOR: I've played mine. It's finished.  
CLENT: What a triumph. Europe saved. Science the victor over nature, and it
happened in my sector. Well, it's not the first time.  
GARRETT: Now we can go ahead. It only needs programming.  
DOCTOR: Aren't you forgetting something?  
CLENT: I'm sorry, but some lives are bound to be lost.  
DOCTOR: No, no, I don't mean that. Arden. He's not yet completed his mission.  
GARRETT: Oh yes, of course. The spaceship reactor. We daren't proceed until
we've heard from Arden.  
CLENT: Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?

**[Plant museum]**

STORR: What did you have to bring him back here for? Another mouth to feed.  
PENLEY: You may hate scientists, Storr, but there's no need to hate all human
beings.  
STORR: I don't trust anyone from Clent's base.  
JAMIE: Who are you? Where's Arden? What happened?! Oh, my head.  
PENLEY: Now you must rest. You're suffering from severe shock. Now just lie
still.  
JAMIE: Well, where am I?  
STORR: Ah, never you mind. Somewhere safe.  
JAMIE: Well, what happened to me and Arden?  
PENLEY: Arden's dead. You were both shot down by the warriors.  
JAMIE: Arden dead?  
PENLEY: They used some sort of ray gun.  
JAMIE: So we failed.  
STORR: You came to rescue the girl? Is that it?  
JAMIE: You've seen Victoria? Is she still alive?  
PENLEY: Yes, she is alive.  
JAMIE: Then we can still save her! You will help me, please!  
PENLEY: Now you're not yet well enough. We'll discuss it later.  
JAMIE: No, it'll be to late then. They might. Oh, my head. No, you must help
me save Victoria. It'll be too late.

**[Glacier cave]**

(Victoria finds the wrist communicator.)  
VICTORIA: Doctor, if only I could make this thing work. This is Victoria
calling the Doctor or Leader Clent. This is Victoria. Please answer me.

**[Spacecraft]**

ZONDAL: The girl, Commander. She will betray us.  
VARGA: She has courage. But she is also very stupid to think that we would not
watch her every move.  
ZONDAL: She must be stopped.

**[Ioniser control room]**

DOCTOR: It's Victoria! Victoria, where are you?  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: I

**[Glacier cave]**

VICTORIA: I don't know

**[Ioniser control room]**

VICTORIA [on monitor]: Some sort of cave.  
DOCTOR: Are you all right?  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: Yes, but, oh Doctor, something terrible's happened!  
DOCTOR: What?  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: They, they've shot Jamie and Arden!  
DOCTOR: What? Well, is he dead? Is, is he wounded? Is he badly wounded?  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: I don't know.  
DOCTOR: What do you mean?  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: Well, he's gone.

**[Glacier cave]**

VICTORIA: Arden's body's still here and he's dead, but the warriors are from
Mars, and. Oh, Doctor, it's horrible!  
CLENT [on monitor]: Keep calm, girl. We want facts. Tell us about the
spacecraft first.  
VICTORIA: No, please, please listen to me. Arden's dead, and Jamie's
disappeared.

**[Spacecraft]**

VICTORIA [on monitor]: Don't you understand? They're ruthless killers and
they'll stop at nothing. Now please, listen to me. There's no time to lose.  
ZONDAL: Ready to fire.

__**Episode Four**__

**[Spacecraft]**

(Varga throws a switch and the weapon turret retracts.)  
VARGA: Not yet.  
ZONDAL: She has betrayed us. She must be destroyed.  
VARGA: Let her talk first.  
ZONDAL: They will know our numbers.  
VARGA: They will also know she is alive. She is the bait.

**[Ioniser control room]**

DOCTOR: Victoria, tell us more about the warriors.  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: They're from Mars.  
CLENT: They're not important. Have you seen the propulsion unit of the
spacecraft, girl?  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: Propulsion unit?  
CLENT: The engines.  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: Oh, yes. They're busy repairing them now.  
CLENT: What kind are they? It's vitally important.  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: I have no idea.  
CLENT: Well, reactor turbine? Ion jet? Anti-gravity? Think, girl!  
DOCTOR: Can you describe them to us, Victoria dear?  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: Yes, yes, I think so.  
CLENT: Well hurry, girl!  
VICTORIA: Look, it isn't easy. Now I have to have time to think.  
(The screen fills with static.)  
DOCTOR: Victoria? Victoria, what's happened? Are you all right? Answer me!  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: I'm all right.

**[Glacier cave]**

VICTORIA: It's the glacier. It's moving all the time.  
DOCTOR [OC]: You're not hurt?  
CLENT [OC]: The engines. Tell us about the engines.

**[Spacecraft]**

VARGA: She has told them enough. Bring her in.  
ZONDAL: Destroy her.  
VARGA: You are wrong, Zondal. She must answer some questions first. Why are
they so interested in our engines? Why are they afraid?

**[Ioniser control room]**

VICTORIA [on monitor]: There's someone coming.  
DOCTOR: Victoria. Victoria. Can you see the base from where you are?  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: Yes. Yes, I can.  
DOCTOR: Do you think you can get back to it?  
VICTORIA [on monitor]: I can give it a try.  
DOCTOR: Well, get in contact again as soon as you can. Good luck.

**[Glacier cave]**

(The spacecraft door opens and an Ice Warrior comes out. Victoria runs off
into the maze that is the business end of the glacier.)

**[Ioniser control room]**

DOCTOR: Yes. This is an automatic chemical dispenser, is it not?  
GARRETT: Yes.  
DOCTOR: How does it work?  
CLENT: Well, you choose the category of the article that you want by
indicating it on one of these little chaps here. Jolly good. And now you dial
the precise chemical formula that you want there.  
DOCTOR: May I? There's something I need rather desperately.  
(The Doctor dials in a short formula. The machine dispenses a sealed plastic
cup. The Doctor removes the seal.)  
CLENT: Oh, what's that?  
DOCTOR: Water.  
(The Doctor drinks it.)  
CLENT: Indeed.  
DOCTOR: Ah, that's better. Now then, let's see. Jamie has vanished.  
(The Doctor does more dialing.)  
DOCTOR: Victoria's on her way back to the base. And neither of them can help
us with our main problem.  
(The Doctor takes a phial from the dispenser.)  
DOCTOR: An exact description of the spacecrafts propulsion unit.  
GARRETT: That will?  
DOCTOR: I will.  
CLENT: With the help of ammonium sulphide?  
DOCTOR: We know these creatures come from Mars, don't we? What do we know
about their planets atmospheric conditions?  
GARRETT: Chiefly nitrogen, with virtually no oxygen or hydrogen.  
DOCTOR: Then they're not going to enjoy this little concoction much, are they?  
CLENT: What? You mean you intend to use it as a kind of toxic gas?  
DOCTOR: Well, if I'm going to an alien spaceship it may come in handy.  
CLENT: Now don't be ridiculous. We've lost Arden already.  
DOCTOR: Arden fell into a trap. I know what to expect.  
CLENT: I refuse to allow you to go!  
DOCTOR: Splendid! You go instead then!  
GARRETT: No one can be spared. Least of all Leader Clent.  
DOCTOR: I can be spared. I've done all I can here. The ioniser will work
without me. I'd start getting it ready if I were you.  
CLENT: But if anything goes wrong with the countdown?  
DOCTOR: Oh, you'll manage.  
CLENT: No.  
DOCTOR: It's as simple as this. Someone has to get to the spacecraft, find out
what sort of propulsion unit it has, and bring the information back to you, or
we can't use the ioniser. Now, who better than me?  
CLENT: I've come to regard you as Penley's replacement, and. All right, all
right. But it's strictly under protest.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
GARRETT: How will you get the information back to us?  
DOCTOR: Ah. Now I don't suppose you have a small radio transmitter?  
CLENT: No, our video links are the only communicators available. Pure sound is
no longer in use.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, you won't see me, but you'll hear me. As soon as I get to
the glacier face I'll switch it on and you'll overhear. I hope.  
GARRETT: Is that all you're taking?  
DOCTOR: Why, what else do I need?  
CLENT; But the Warriors are armed.  
DOCTOR: But I'm not going to fight a duel.  
GARRETT: But you must be in a position to defend yourself. They'll try to kill
you out of hand.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. This is my defence.  
CLENT: But how can you rely on that? They've already proved themselves to be
utterly ruthless.  
DOCTOR: I think they'll listen to me.  
GARRETT: You mean you're going to let them take you prisoner?  
DOCTOR: That is exactly what I'm going to do.

**[Glacier]**

(The ice warrior has found Victoria so she runs deeper into the glacier maze.
But it catches up to her again. Victoria screams and runs into what seems to
be a dead end. She breaks through a thin ice wall but loses the wrist
communicator. Going back for it, she just manages to hide as the ice warrior
makes the hole big enough for itself to walk through and past her, almost
treading on the communicator as it goes. Victoria goes to pick it up and she
is caught. Then an avalanche pours snow down upon them.)

**[Plant museum]**

PENLEY: He's going to wake. His pulse isn't too good.  
STORR: His fever's gone.  
PENLEY: Well, his body is young. It will heal.  
STORR: Then why you looking so worried?  
PENLEY: I don't know yet. The weapon they used on him. Peculiar.  
STORR: Aye, scientifically designed, of course.  
PENLEY: This is no time for debates.  
STORR: Aye, it's easily said. I'll away and fetch a fresh drink.  
JAMIE: You'll not keep me prisoner!  
PENLEY: Stay still!  
JAMIE: No, get away out of it!  
PENLEY: Storr!  
STORR: Do not fight us.  
JAMIE: You'll not keep me!  
PENLEY: We you're friends!  
STORR: We saved your life.  
JAMIE: Oh, oh my head.  
(Penley puts a compress to Jamie's forehead.)  
JAMIE: What are you doing to me?  
PENLEY: I'm going to try and ease your pain with this tranquilliser pad.  
JAMIE: I don't believe you.  
PENLEY: Now you must trust us. We know about your friend. We may be able to
help.  
JAMIE: Victoria? Well, where is she?  
PENLEY: In the alien spaceship.  
JAMIE: Alien?  
PENLEY: These warriors are not of our time, nor of this planet.  
JAMIE: Well, how would you know all that?  
STORR: Ah, because he's a scientist. He can produce an explanation for
anything.  
JAMIE: And you?  
STORR: I'm a loyalist.  
JAMIE: A loyalist.  
STORR: Ah, they've told you, have they?  
JAMIE: Aye. But there's no time to talk. I came here to rescue Victoria.  
PENLEY: You're in no state  
JAMIE: Oh, just you try me. Here, give me a hand.  
(Storr helps Jamie to stand.)  
STORR: He's no as bad as you say, Penley.  
JAMIE: No, scientists aren't always right.  
STORR: You hear that, Penley? But your legs are still weak.  
JAMIE: My legs! I can't feel them. I can't stand!  
STORR: Oh, is this what your stupid drugs can do?  
PENLEY: Don't be a fool, Storr. Of course it's not the drugs.  
JAMIE: Well, what is it then?  
PENLEY: Well, their weapons must have affected your central nervous system.  
JAMIE: You mean I'm paralysed?

**[Spacecraft]**

(Zondal enters.)  
VARGA: Where is the girl?  
ZONDAL: Turoc has not yet returned.  
VARGA: He must find her.  
ZONDAL: Why?  
VARGA: We need her to draw an intelligent being from the base.  
ZONDAL: To find out the kind of reactor they use.  
VARGA: Yes. Without the mercury fuel elements we are helpless.  
ZONDAL: And if they have them?  
VARGA: We shall take them.  
(Two ice warriors enter.)  
VARGA: Is the fuel completely run down?  
(A warrior nods.)  
ZONDAL: If these scientists succeed in melting the ice?  
VARGA: There will be floods.  
ZONDAL: No hope for our engines then.  
VARGA: Or for us.  
ZONDAL: The gun is our only chance.

**[Glacier]**

VICTORIA: Help! Oh, somebody help me!  
(Victoria is held fast by the ice warrior's 'hand'.)  
VICTORIA: Help! Somebody!  
(More ice falls nearby. Victoria screams, which can't help its stability at
all.)  
VICTORIA: Oh please! Help me, somebody! Please help me!

**[Plant museum]**

PENLEY: Well, there's little more I can do for him. That's the last of the
tranquilliser pads.  
STORR: Do ye understand his illness?  
PENLEY: No, and I've no way of knowing the cause.  
STORR: Well, there's one way we can save him.  
PENLEY: How?  
STORR: To befriend the aliens.  
PENLEY: Oh, don't be a fool, Storr.  
STORR: Oh, they'll help us. I'll talk to them. They'll understand.  
PENLEY: But they're warriors, trained to kill.  
STORR: Ach, only in self-defense, surely.  
PENLEY: Oh, rubbish. No. We've got to get the boy back to the base.  
STORR: No!  
PENLEY: For the boys sake.  
STORR: Oh, ye're trying to trap me. There's no return for me to the
civilisation that Clent represents. This is where I stay.  
PENLEY: Do you think the aliens are any better? They killed Arden.  
STORR: Ach, they were afraid.  
PENLEY: They're ruthless. They place no value on human life.  
STORR: Well, I'll talk to them. Someone has to.  
PENLEY: We don't know what they're capable of, or why they're here.  
STORR: Well, I'll ask questions first, then act.  
PENLEY: It may be too late then.  
STORR: We'll see.  
PENLEY: No, wait, Storr. Look, you don't know what you're running into.  
STORR: Now don't try and stop me. You look after the boy.

**[Glacier]**

PENLEY [OC]: Storr! Storr! Storr! Storr!  
(Storr picks up a lump of ice to use on Penley, then - )  
VICTORIA: Can you hear me! Help! Oh! I'm trapped!  
(Storr leaves. Penley arrives and dodges an icefall then goes in the opposite
direction. Further on he finds -)  
DOCTOR: Oh, it's you again, is it?  
PENLEY: Has anyone passed this way?  
DOCTOR: No. Are you looking for someone?  
PENLEY: A rather ragged fellow like me.  
DOCTOR: No, nobody. Not even like me.  
PENLEY: Then I'm too late. There's nothing I can do.  
DOCTOR: Can I help you?  
PENLEY: Well, you've helped me once already. Why didn't you give me away or
stop me at the base?  
DOCTOR: Well, why should I? I don't believe everything Clent tells me.  
PENLEY: This boy. He's your friend.  
DOCTOR: You know where he is? Is he hurt?  
PENLEY: Come this way.  
(Meanwhile, elsewhere.)  
VICTORIA: Help me, please! Who are you?  
STORR: Ach, never mind about that now.  
VICTORIA: Would you release me please?  
(Storr pries open the ice warrior's hand.)  
STORR: What happened?  
VICTORIA: I run away and the warrior caught me. The ice fell  
STORR: You ran away? But why?  
VICTORIA: The warriors, they're evil. They killed Arden. I think they want to
destroy the base.  
STORR: They are against the scientists?  
VICTORIA: I know, but they won't listen. They think the ioniser is a weapon
against them.  
STORR: Aye, it's true. A weapon of destruction.  
VICTORIA: Only to destroy the ice.  
STORR: Ach, it will destroy civilisation.  
VICTORIA: Anyway, thank you. Where were you going?  
STORR: Well, your friend, the boy.  
VICTORIA: Jamie? Jamie is alive? Oh, is he all right?  
STORR: Ah, he's desperately ill. I'm going for help.  
VICTORIA: But where?  
(More ice falls.)  
STORR: We'd better move out of here quickly.

**[Glacier cave]**

VARGA: Is it ready?  
ZONDAL: We are checking the motivator. Reline harmonic frequencies to target
point. When do we attack the base?  
VARGA: Soon, Zondal, soon. Has Turoc returned?  
ZONDAL: Not yet.  
VARGA: The ice, it is alive.  
(The ice warriors conceal themselves.)  
VICTORIA [OC]: The spaceship!  
STORR [OC]: Aye.  
VICTORIA [OC]: You came here on purpose?  
STORR [OC]: Of course!  
VICTORIA: I'm not coming with you!  
STORR: Oh, but you must. We must. We'll be safe. They'll listen to me.  
VICTORIA: But they won't. You can't trust them.  
STORR: Ah, they're against the scientists and the ioniser. That's good enough
for me.  
VICTORIA: Is that your reason? I think that's wicked!  
STORR: They'll understand.  
VICTORIA: Let go of me!  
(Storr pulls Victoria forward, straight into Varga.)  
VICTORIA: Oh!  
VARGA: Where is Turoc?  
VICTORIA: He was crushed by the ice.  
VARGA: I give you your life. You run away. Because of that, one of my men is
dead.  
VICTORIA: Honestly, it wasn't my fault.  
VARGA: Take her inside.  
VICTORIA: You're not going to kill me, are you?  
(Victoria and an ice warrior leave.)  
STORR: My name is Storr. I'm a scavenger. A loyalist.  
VARGA: You are from the base?  
STORR: No, I'm against the scientists.  
ZONDAL: You know nothing of their machines?  
STORR: No, I don't want to. Their intentions are evil. I want to help you
destroy the scientists.  
ZONDAL: You. What good are you to us?  
STORR: Oh, well, I know the land around here. I've lived here all my life.  
VARGA: You are not a scientist, only a local native.  
ZONDAL: Useless and unnecessary.  
STORR: But, but I want to help you.  
(Varga and Zondal fire their wrist guns and kill Storr.)  
VARGA: Now to question the girl.

**[Plant museum]**

DOCTOR: Yes, there we are.  
JAMIE: It's good to see you again, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Ah, won't be long before you're on your feet again, Jamie.  
JAMIE: How long?  
DOCTOR: Well, that depends. You've had some sort of shock to your brain. It's
affected your nervous system.  
JAMIE: I will walk again though?  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, of course you will. It's just a matter of time, that's all.  
JAMIE: Aye, well I'll take your word on that.  
PENLEY: What can we do for him?  
DOCTOR: Well the base is the only place he can be treated.  
PENLEY: Yes I know that, but he can't get there alone.  
(A pane of glass breaks and ice falls in.)  
PENLEY: That's the glacier. It's moving forward even faster.  
DOCTOR: Yes. It'll flatten this place in no time at all.  
PENLEY: All right. I'll help you take him back.  
DOCTOR: Well, that's just it, you see. I can't go. There's something I must
do.  
PENLEY: You don't expect me to face Clent alone? That mouth piece of the
computer? He's got a printed circuit where his heart should be.  
DOCTOR: He's a man with a mission. I don't think he can afford to reject you.  
PENLEY: Well, that's not the point. Anyway, what are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: I must speak with the warriors.  
JAMIE: No, Doctor!  
PENLEY: What can you do alone?  
DOCTOR: I have to see whether Victoria got away safely, and I must find out
whether this spacecraft is a danger to the ionisation programme. I admit it
won't be easy.  
JAMIE: Doctor, if you go to the warriors you'll be their prisoner.  
DOCTOR: Their guest I hope, Jamie.

**[Ioniser control room]**

CLENT: Look, Miss Garrett, look. The glacier moving. That's the fifth surge
today. The ioniser just isn't holding it anymore.  
GARRETT: But we daren't increase power beyond the minimal.  
CLENT: Well, I know the risk if the spaceship explodes. Cobalt radioactivity
level. We'd only replace one disaster with an even greater one.  
GARRETT: But you must make a decision soon.  
CLENT: No decision to be made yet. Computer can act only when given adequate
information. We still don't know enough about the alien reactor.  
GARRETT: But suppose we never know? Suppose the Doctor never returns?  
CLENT: We'll face that if and when we have to.  
GARRETT: But you must have a plan in mind, surely?  
CLENT: I'm pinning all my hopes on the Doctor. He must succeed.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Here we go, Clent old chap. Wish me luck.

**[Glacier cave]**

(There is more ice falling as the Doctor arrives outside the spaceship. He
knocks on the entrance hatch.)  
DOCTOR: Anyone at home?  
(The Doctor sees the weapon by the hatch. It comes out of the bulkhead so the
Doctor ducks underneath it and returns to the hatch.)  
DOCTOR: Open up. Come on. Open up, I say! Very well, I shall count to ten.
One, two, three. Ah!

**[Airlock]**

(The hatch opens and the Doctor marches in.)  
VARGA [on monitor]: Who are you?  
DOCTOR: I never answer questions until I'm addressed properly.  
VARGA [on monitor]: You will answer now. Very well. You are standing in the
airlock of this spacecraft. Unless you answer my questions within ten seconds,
I will take atmospheric pressure around you down to zero.  
DOCTOR: But if you do that my body will explode.  
VARGA: One, two, three, four  
(The pressure gauge on the wall drops rapidly.)

__**Episode Five**__

**[Airlock]**

DOCTOR: All right, all right! I don't think much of your hospitality.  
VARGA [on monitor]: Identify yourself.  
DOCTOR: Me? I'm a scientist. I've come to talk with you.

**[Spacecraft]**

DOCTOR [on monitor]: To help you.  
VARGA: A scientist?  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Yes. Yes, you could call me that.  
ZONDAL: You do not look like a scientist.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Looks aren't everything, you know.  
VARGA: You look more like a scavenger. We killed him.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Well if you kill me, you'll ruin any chance you may have
of escape.  
ZONDAL: Do you think he can help us?  
VARGA: He cannot afford to lie. Allow him to enter.  
(The Doctor enters.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, thank you very much. That's very civil of you. Oh, my word!  
(The Doctor tries to leave but the door has shut.)  
VARGA: You claim to be able to help us.  
DOCTOR: No, I am sure I can help you. On certain conditions.  
VARGA: You are our prisoner. It is we who set conditions.  
(The spacecraft shakes.)  
DOCTOR: On the contrary, it is you who are the prisoner, and I can help you.  
VARGA: Not on your terms. Bring in the girl. Now we will have two hostages.  
DOCTOR: Well, what good will that do? You are buried alive in the heart of
this glacier. Time is desperately short. You've got no time to bargain over
hostages.  
VARGA: Inside our spaceship, we are safe. And with you here, your base will
dare not use their secret weapon against us.  
DOCTOR: Weapon? But the ioniser is not a weapon.  
VARGA: You know how it works?  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It'll melt the ice and set you free!  
VICTORIA: You're hurting me!  
DOCTOR: Victoria!  
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! Oh dear, but they've got you too.  
DOCTOR: It's all right. We are not beaten yet.  
VICTORIA: What about Jamie?  
DOCTOR: He's alive.  
VARGA: If what you say is true, why have you not freed us before?  
DOCTOR: Well, there are difficulties.  
VARGA: What are they?  
DOCTOR: Well.  
VARGA: You will tell us.

**[Snowfield]**

(Wolves howl as Penley drags Jamie on a travois through the remains of a
forest. It gets stuck.)  
PENLEY: You're caught on a bough or something. Well, it's not much farther
now, lad.  
JAMIE: How far are we?  
PENLEY: Well, we're at the edge of the woods fringing the camp perimeter.  
JAMIE: Can we not rest a while?  
PENLEY: I think so, but a couple of minutes, no more.  
JAMIE: Aye, you're right. The Doctor needs help right away.  
PENLEY: I wasn't thinking only of the Doctor.  
JAMIE: Wolves.  
PENLEY: Yes. Here we're more or less safe, but the last stretch is open
country.  
JAMIE: I don't help much, do I?  
PENLEY: Well, I'm not exactly a man of action myself. Storr should be here
now. I miss him.  
JAMIE: Have you no weapons?  
PENLEY: Arden's tranquilliser gun, that's all.  
JAMIE: Aye, it's not much.  
PENLEY: Storr was a huntsman. An expert with a bow and arrow.  
JAMIE: It's no good wishing.  
PENLEY: Well, I'd better carry on.  
JAMIE: Aye, lead on McDuff.  
(A bear comes through the trees.)  
PENLEY: Keep very still.

**[Spacecraft]**

VARGA: So you are afraid of us.  
DOCTOR: No, but of your ship. If the ioniser sets off a nuclear holocaust, it
will all have be in vain.  
VARGA: That is good. In that case you dare not act.  
ZONDAL: But if you thought there would be no explosion?  
VARGA: Well?  
DOCTOR: Well, in that case we'd have no choice.  
VARGA: You would use the ioniser.  
DOCTOR: But it wouldn't harm the ship. It would release it.  
ZONDAL: There would be floods.  
VARGA: Our engines would be useless.  
ZONDAL: We would be at your mercy.  
VARGA: Why did you come here?  
ZONDAL: To spy? To betray us?  
VARGA: But you could not hope to escape to tell the tale.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I always live in hope.  
VARGA: You have some kind of communicator.  
DOCTOR: You do realise, don't you, that after a certain point, my base will

**[Ioniser control room]**

DOCTOR [on monitor]: Have to activate the ioniser regardless of the
consequences?  
VARGA [on monitor]: And destroy you and themselves as well?

**[Spacecraft]**

DOCTOR: Is that what would happen?  
VARGA: Give it to me.  
(The Doctor gives Varga the communicator.)  
VARGA: Ah, they would never know.

**[Ioniser control room]**

VARGA [on monitor]: They would never know.  
GARRETT: The Doctor. You heard what he said.  
CLENT: Regardless of the consequences. Yes. Yes, he's telling us to take the
risk.  
GARRETT: But we can't give the computer the information it needs. It can't
instruct us.  
CLENT: Can the ioniser hold?  
GARRETT: At present power it's steadily losing ground. But we dare not
increase.  
COMPUTER: Summary of orders to all World Ioniser Stations. The new equation
originated from Brittanicus Base will be adopted to conditions prevailing in
each sector. All bases will prepare to use full ioniser attack on the ice in
concerted action. Zero hour in six hours exactly. Report readiness one hour.  
CLENT: We can't do it.  
GARRETT: But if we don't the whole plan must fail.  
CLENT: But if we act and there is an explosion, apart from destroying this
base the contamination could easily  
GARRETT: We must state our problem to World Control, now.  
CLENT: No, wait! We'll give our computer all the information we have.  
GARRETT: It isn't enough.  
CLENT: It may be. It may be.  
GARRETT: I know what the computer will say.  
CLENT: No, no, no, no, no. Let the computer speak for itself.  
GARRETT: There's only one answer it can give.  
CLENT: Come on, quickly. Put the situation to the computer. Do as you're told!

**[Snowfield]**

PENLEY: He's sizing us up.  
JAMIE: Can you not run for it?  
PENLEY: I don't intend to leave you here as hors d'oeuvre, laddie.  
JAMIE: Well, the gun. Use the gun.  
PENLEY: I couldn't hit the side of the mountain. I'm a scientist, not a
gladiator.  
JAMIE: Well, at least you can try.  
PENLEY: All right. Well, cross your fingers. Here goes.  
(Penley fires and the bear comes towards them.)  
JAMIE: Quick, get me out of here. I'll tackle him. Get a hold of yourself,
man.  
PENLEY: He's charging now!  
JAMIE: Quick, he's nearly on us!  
(The bear is just about on top of them when Penley fires again.)

**[Ioniser control room]**

COMPUTER: Set up all circuits to new equation and wait. Further information
essential before decision can be taken. Prepare to notify World Control in
event of emergency.  
CLENT: Of course, the computer's right. We must be prepared, and we must wait.  
GARRETT: It is the answer I expected.  
CLENT: But you don't realise why it made this choice, do you?  
GARRETT: Because it is the most logical answer in the circumstances.  
CLENT: Of course. And because it's so logical, it can't gamble. It can't take
risks.  
GARRETT: That is its function. To be totally impartial. To serve the
community.  
CLENT: Exactly. And one more aim in its life, to survive.  
GARRETT: It has given us its decision.  
CLENT: It is no decision. The computer is playing for time. Now listen, all of
you! We risk destruction either by a radioactive explosion or by the slow
grind of the glaciers. Now there you see that the ice has advanced one hundred
metres today. Now either way  
GARRETT: The computer is destroyed.  
CLENT: So that, by demanding a decision, we are asking it to commit suicide.  
GARRETT: It can't do that!  
CLENT: Then what is the answer?  
GARRETT: We can escape. There's still time to evacuate.  
CLENT: Perhaps you could face world opinionata. I couldn't.  
GARRETT: You must notify World Control eventually. The other bases will be
waiting.  
CLENT: I will decide exactly when. For now we do as the computer says. Prepare
the ioniser and wait. Now, complete data check please, Miss Garrett. Miss
Curtis, report to me the moment marker four reaches one five oh oh. One three
seven nine, now. Well, what do you feel about all this, Walters? Bet you
didn't think you'd have ice monsters and things like that to deal with when
you volunteered for the job, did you? Well, did you?  
WALTERS: I didn't volunteer.  
CLENT: Ah, yes. Well, good man, anyway.

**[Snowfield]**

JAMIE: Penley! Penley, are you all right?  
PENLEY: If I can get out from under this brute I will be.  
JAMIE: You sure you're all right?  
PENLEY: Well he's clawed me, that's all.  
JAMIE: Now we'd better get away, quick. He won't be any friendlier when he
wakes up.

**[Spacecraft]**

VARGA: Close engine room. Well?  
DOCTOR: It's an ion reactor, isn't it? Hmm. It could be dangerous, but it
wouldn't necessarily explode.  
VARGA: True. But your friends do not know that.  
DOCTOR: Now why don't you let us help you?  
VARGA: We can get what we want without your help.  
DOCTOR: But what else do you need, apart from escaping from the ice?  
VARGA: We have had enough of your questions. Now you will give me answers.  
DOCTOR: Well, I've told you all I can about the ioniser.  
VARGA: That is only a toy. The base. What is its power source?  
DOCTOR: Why on earth do you want to know that?  
VARGA: Answer.  
DOCTOR: Oh, so that's what you need, is it?  
ZONDAL: Answer the Commander's questions.  
(Zondal has his gun at Victoria's head)  
DOCTOR: Fuel! Fuel for your reactor! And suppose I don't tell you?  
VARGA: The girl dies now.  
VICTORIA: Doctor, don't tell them.  
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll find what you need at the base.  
VICTORIA: You shouldn't have!  
DOCTOR: But you won't find Leader Clent easy to persuade. He's a very
obstinate man.  
VARGA: He will listen to our sonic cannon.  
ZONDAL: We must act quickly, Commander.  
VARGA: Isbur and Rintan, wait for me at the entrance to the cave. Zondal, you
will man the sonic gun.  
VICTORIA: You won't succeed. You can't be so inhuman.  
VARGA: We only fight to win.

**[Ioniser control room]**

GARRETT: Ion density reading at 1000. 2000. 3000. 4000\. 5000. Operate.  
WALTERS [on monitor]: Reception check point to Leader Clent.  
CLENT: Yes, what is it?  
WALTERS [on monitor]: Two new arrivals, sir.  
CLENT: Well, I don't wish to be disturbed by trifles!  
WALTERS [on monitor]: These aren't scavengers, sir. It's the lad that came
with the Doctor and Scientist Penley.  
CLENT: What?  
PENLEY [on monitor]: Clent, I must talk to you. I have news of the Doctor.  
CLENT: Walters! Bring the arrivals to me at once.  
WALTERS [on monitor]: Sir.  
GARRETT: Density compensator setting, please.  
COMPUTER: Density compensator setting, zero three nine seven seven seven zero
one. Sequence ends.  
GARRETT: Take all systems up to this level. Everything seems to be proceeding
satisfactorily.  
CLENT: Is it?  
GARRETT: What's wrong?  
CLENT: Penley's come back.  
GARRETT: Of his own choice?  
CLENT: Apparently.  
GARRETT: But why?  
CLENT: We shall soon see. If he tries to start any trouble  
GARRETT: Well, he can't be allowed to interfere with the programme. Not at
this stage.  
CLENT: No. I no longer need to be tolerant with him because he's no longer my
equal. He's an outsider.  
(Walters and Penley carry Jamie in.)  
WALTERS: Come on then.  
PENLEY: Put him over here.  
WALTERS: Take it easy.  
PENLEY: Rest on that, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Thank you.  
WALTERS: All right there, lad?  
JAMIE: Thank you.  
CLENT: No, stay, Walters. You may be needed.  
PENLEY: I'm not liable to be violent.  
(Penley hands over his little weapon.)  
CLENT: What do you want?  
PENLEY: Well, I brought this lad. He's in desperate need of medical
supervision.  
GARRETT: We are not a first-aid centre.  
PENLEY: He's paralysed.  
CLENT: How did it happen?  
PENLEY: He was shot down by the warrior's guns.  
CLENT: Well, thank heaven their weapons don't deal fatal blows.  
PENLEY: Well they killed Arden.  
JAMIE: Look, you've got to help.  
CLENT: Yes of course, boy. Walters will take you to the Medi-Control Centre.  
JAMIE: No, I didn't mean me. I meant Victoria and the Doctor. Look, they're
inside the alien spaceship. You've got to help them!  
CLENT: That isn't possible.  
JAMIE: Well it must be. You've got to do something.  
CLENT: No, we lost contact with the Doctor over an hour ago. I'm afraid
there's no hope.  
PENLEY: You mean hope happens to be inconvenient. You've got to stick to your
precious schedule, is that it? You've got to wave your splendid ioniser about
to prove that it works and never mind about human beings.  
GARRETT: The computer has decided.  
PENLEY: The computer? Override it. Let the ioniser wait. The computer isn't
going to fall apart because it has to mark time for an hour.  
CLENT: We are marking time. We're not using the ioniser under instructions
from the computer itself.  
PENLEY: Why?  
GARRETT: The spaceship may contain a reactor system that could wipe us off
this island if we cause it to explode.  
PENLEY: So what are you going to do?  
CLENT: We obey the computer. We will wait.  
PENLEY: Wait? But that's suicide. The glacier's practically on top of us.  
CLENT: We still have time in hand.  
JAMIE: Yes, but if the Doctor, if he's still  
CLENT: No.  
PENLEY: If the Doctor doesn't contact you, then what hope is there?  
CLENT: There is hope.  
PENLEY: Oh don't be a fool, Clent. You're not a man, you're just a machine
slave.  
CLENT: Don't you spit your stupid liberty in my face, Penley. We know your
kind of freedom. Freedom to run away from responsibilities, from service, from
moral judgement. I may be a physical coward, Penley, but you're a coward in
the mind.  
PENLEY: Well at least I have a mind and not a transistorised junction box. I
would act, but you daren't. And so you're going to be destroyed along with
your mechanical master.  
JAMIE: Look, you've got to help us, man.  
PENLEY: Jamie, I don't think you're  
(Jamie takes hold of Clent's arm. Clent starts shouting and Walters enters and
shoots Penley and Jamie.)  
CLENT: There! Now, get them out of here!  
GARRETT: You'd better take them to the Medi-Control Centre. Get someone to
look at the boy. Make sure there's a guard for when they come to.  
WALTERS: Right. Send two guards to control.  
CLENT: Penley. He's nothing.  
GARRETT: Our trust is in the great computer. With its aid, we cannot fail.

**[Spacecraft]**

VARGA [on monitor]: I am now outside their base. Stand by, gun control. Take
target readings.  
(The sonic gun protrudes from the ship's hull again.)  
ZONDAL: Ready. Vertical bearing minus point nine. Lateral bearing three five.  
(The cross hairs are now in the centre of the dome.)  
ZONDAL: Prepare to charge to frequency three five.  
WARRIOR [OC]: Frequency three five.  
(The Doctor gestures Victoria to cry.)  
DOCTOR: It's all right Victoria, don't cry. It's all right. There's nothing to
be afraid of.  
ZONDAL: Wait until Varga returns triumphant. Then you will have cause to cry.  
DOCTOR: Come along, Victoria, blow. Blow.  
(The Doctor makes the nose-blowing sound.)  
DOCTOR: That's better, that's better. (sotto) We can try and escape with this.  
VICTORIA: (sotto) What is it?  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Ammonium sulphide.  
VICTORIA: (sotto) Ammonium sulphide? It's only a stink bomb.  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, you've had the benefits of a classical education. Yes, it
is what you'd call a stink bomb.  
VICTORIA: (sotto) What use is that?  
DOCTOR: (sotto) You'd be surprised. Harmless to humans, but to aliens very
possibly deadly!  
ZONDAL: The gun is fully ready, Commander.  
VARGA [on monitor]: Good, Zondal. We will now contact the scientists. On my
command you will fire once. Do you understand?  
ZONDAL: Yes, Commander.  
VARGA [on monitor]: Good.  
VICTORIA: Zondal. Zondal, look!  
ZONDAL: What is it?  
VICTORIA: Look!  
ZONDAL: Do not try any tricks.  
(Victoria points to the bottom of the airlock door as the Doctor sneaks up
behind Zondal.)  
VICTORIA: There's, there's water, seeping into the ship. Just there.  
DOCTOR: I can't get it undone.  
VICTORIA: Look, over in the corner there.  
(Victoria goes to help the Doctor.)  
VICTORIA: Let me.  
ZONDAL: You tricked me. There is no water. What is that? Let me have it. Give
it to me at once.  
VARGA [on monitor]: Zondal.  
(Victoria throws the ammonium sulphate into Zondal's face.)  
VARGA [on monitor]: Zondal, fire. Fire now. Zondal, fire. Zondal fire. Fire
now.  
(Zondal tries to reach the firing switch as he collapses. The Doctor struggles
to keep his hand away from it.)

__**Episode Six**__

**[Ioniser control room]**

GARRETT: Co-ordinates for area red one. Oh oh eight one nine three vertical,
eight five eight one eight oh lateral. Parallel lateral shift. Controls are
set.  
CLENT: (unintelligible under the rising sound of the ioniser.)  
(The chandelier drops part way and ceiling plaster falls.)  
WALTERS: The records wing! It's gone! It's demolished!  
CLENT: We're under attack! Report!  
VARGA [on monitor]: Leader Clent, surrender or die!  
CLENT: What in the blazes?  
VARGA [on monitor]; Surrender now or I will blast your base to fragments.  
CLENT: No, I refuse! You can't destroy us!  
VARGA [on monitor]: You do not believe me? Very well. Must I fire again?  
GARRETT: We must play for time.  
WALTERS: The building won't stand much more of this bombardment, sir.  
CLENT: Then we must talk. Who am I addressing?  
VARGA [on monitor]: My name is Varga. Do you surrender?  
CLENT: Now frankly, you'll gain nothing by destroying us, Varga. We both have
urgent needs. I will agree to talk but nothing more.  
VARGA [on monitor]: No treachery. If I come in peace there must be trust
between us.  
CLENT: Very well. There will be no traps, or conditions.  
VARGA [on monitor]: See that you keep to that, for if you lie.  
(Transmission ends.)  
GARRETT: What does he want?  
WALTERS: Our guards won't stand a chance against weapons like that, sir.  
CLENT: You heard what he said. No treachery, only trust.  
GARRETT: But can we trust him?  
CLENT: I'm afraid we have to. He's got the best argument on his side. That
gun, or whatever it is.  
GARRETT: We can bluff him though.  
CLENT: How?  
GARRETT: He doesn't know the computer's command to wait. We can threaten to
destroy the glacier and his ship with it.  
CLENT: Yes, yes. Yes possibly.  
WALTERS: Well why can't we do it, sir? It's our only chance for survival.  
GARRETT: You know the computers decision and its reasons.  
WALTERS: I know all about that. But it doesn't exactly give much thought to
us, does it?  
GARRETT: The computer thinks of everything, considers all the facts.  
WALTERS: And it's supposed to come up with all the answers, isn't it? Well, a
fat lot of good it's doing us now. Wait, it says, wait! With glaciers on the
one hand, and warriors on the other! Well, what price your computer now.  
CLENT: Walters!  
WALTERS: What we need is someone like Penley, or that Doctor. Somebody who can
think. Not with a machine. And what good's your precious computer done anyway?
Nothing! Nothing but trouble! And it's time somebody put a stop to it.  
(Walters raises his arms to smash a panel with a piece of debris, and Garrett
shoots him.)

**[Spacecraft]**

VICTORIA: That's Varga's voice.  
DOCTOR: Shush.  
VARGA [on monitor]: We are going in now.  
VICTORIA: We must escape.  
DOCTOR: It's not just a question of escape, Victoria. We've got to take some
action. It's this gun that's given Varga control of the base. Without it he'd
be helpless.  
VICTORIA: What can we do?  
(The Doctor opens up a panel by the gun control.)

**[Ioniser control room]**

(Three ice warriors enter.)  
CLENT: Well now, gentlemen, you said no traps and we for our part have made
utterly sure, that there are no traps  
VARGA: I made no promises. I merely warned you not to trick me.  
GARRETT: How can we help you?  
VARGA: I will tell you what I want and you will give it to me.  
CLENT: Oh, come now, Varga. That's not the way to talk. We're both of us in a
very difficult situation and at times like this it beholds us both to proceed
with mutual respect and, because the whole world could be  
(Walters has woken and is reaching for his weapon. An ice warrior kills him.)  
VARGA: So much for your word.  
CLENT: That was, that was not planned.  
VARGA: I have one major requirement. The mercury isotopes for my ships
reactor. You will give them to me.  
CLENT: But we don't use mercury isotopes.  
VARGA: The Doctor stated that you had them here.  
CLENT: Well, he was wrong. We have none.  
VARGA: You are lying.  
CLENT: What good will it do me?  
VARGA: Tell me what will happen if we halted your reactor in order to remove
the fuel elements we need.  
GARRETT: You can't do that!  
VARGA: Why?  
CLENT: That reactor gives us light, heat and power.  
GARRETT: And it powers the ioniser.  
VARGA: So that without it, you would be completely helpless.  
CLENT: In Arctic conditions like these we'd soon perish.  
VARGA: Whereas we would not.  
CLENT: You'd be wasting your time. This reactor does not use mercury.  
VARGA: I do not believe you.  
CLENT: But you must.

**[Spacecraft]**

VARGA [on monitor]: There is only one way to find out. Where are the reactor
controls? Tell me now.  
VICTORIA: Did you hear that? Making them shut down the reactor.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Now this is Varga's main weapon. There's just a chance that I can
turn it against him.  
VICTORIA: What?  
DOCTOR: If I can open these doors. There we are. Come on.

**[Glacier cave]**

DOCTOR: Now careful. Just stay there. How does this gun operate?  
VICTORIA: Oh, hurry, Doctor, hurry.

**[Ioniser control room]**

CLENT: You've got to believe me!  
VARGA: So you say.  
CLENT: Listen, Varga, the power source is locked in directly with the ioniser.
Now if we cut the power before it is safe, the feedback effect could blast
this building into a state of ion flux.  
VARGA: What's its temperature range?  
CLENT: It can melt rock. Don't interfere with it! It's fully primed.  
VARGA: It can melt rock. What a weapon.  
GARRETT: It is not a weapon. It is a scientific instrument.  
VARGA: I see it differently.  
CLENT: It's still a highly dangerous machine.  
VARGA: Then run is carefully down to safety level. But no tricks. You do it
now.  
GARRETT: It will take some time.  
VARGA: Does it matter? You dare not use it anyway.  
CLENT: What?  
VARGA: Your Doctor friend talked. I know your fear of my spaceship. That it
will explode if the heat is too great.  
CLENT: Would it?  
VARGA: Close it down or you die.  
CLENT: She's the only person qualified to disconnect the ioniser safely.  
VARGA: What are your qualifications for existence?  
CLENT: I'm the leader here.  
VARGA: You have less value to me than your colleague, who has certain skills.  
CLENT: But she doesn't know everything. I have the answers that you require.  
VARGA: I know all I need to know. If I killed you, it would be no great loss
to me.  
GARRETT: No, please!  
VARGA: Then you will do as I say. Run down the machine as quickly as is safely
possible. No more tricks. At once.

**[Glacier cave]**

(The Doctor has got into the gun's circuitry.)  
VICTORIA: What is it you're trying to do?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's a little difficult to explain, Victoria. Oh. Oh dear. Hold
this for me, will you? This gun works on the basis that sound waves produce
reverberations in the objects in their path.  
VICTORIA: The objects vibrate in sympathy. Well, I know. My father told me
once.  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Well if you can produce unsympathetic vibrations,
damage results.  
VICTORIA: Damage? Oh, like a singer breaking glass.  
DOCTOR: Yes. But I want to be able to get at the warriors without it affecting
the scientists too much. Now, if we change this to frequency seven.  
VICTORIA: What will that do?  
DOCTOR: Well, primarily it affects fluids.  
VICTORIA: What good is that to us?  
DOCTOR: Well, I believe that Varga and his warriors have a far greater fluid
content than human beings. There.  
VICTORIA: If it works, what happens?  
DOCTOR: That's just it. I don't know.  
VICTORIA: Oh now look, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: But I do know that whatever effect it has on the scientists, it'll
have a far greater one on the warriors.

**[Spacecraft]**

VICTORIA: Well, how's that?  
DOCTOR: Well, apart from the fluid question, their helmets will trap and
intensify the soundwaves.  
VICTORIA: You mean, it'll knock them out and leave the scientists a bit dizzy.
Well, is that it?  
DOCTOR: Well, that's what I'm hoping, but there is just a vague risk that
it'll kill everybody. Clent and Penley included.  
VICTORIA: And Jamie?

**[Medi-control centre]**

(Jamie and Penley are lying on trolleys. Penley wakes and checks Jamie, then
leaves. Jamie wakes.)

**[Ioniser control room]**

GARRETT: It's done.  
VARGA: It is safe now?  
GARRETT: Yes. Just ticking over. Not even holding the ice in check at all.  
VARGA: Disconnect it completely, now. Now we must move quickly, before the
glacial surge does too much damage.  
CLENT: You'll regret this, Varga.  
VARGA: At least I will live to regret it. Now, the reactor. Shut it down,
quickly.  
(Penley is watching through the open doorway. He crosses to the thermostat in
the corridor.)  
PENLEY: Perfectly at home in ice age conditions. Well, we'll soon change all
that.  
(Penley moves temperature to maximum, oxygen to minimum and humidity to
maximum.)  
VARGA: Shut it down at once. The heat. What is happening? There is something
wrong.  
(A heat haze rises.)  
VARGA: You are trying to trick me again. For that you will die.

**[Spacecraft]**

VICTORIA: No, no, no. It's too dangerous!  
DOCTOR: It's a risk we must take, Victoria!  
VICTORIA: Oh!  
DOCTOR: Now, cross your fingers. Here we go.

**[Ioniser control room]**

(The sonic gun is fired, and everyone clutches their head in pain. Clent
screams. The ice warriors beat at their helmets as the humans pass out.)

**[Spacecraft]**

DOCTOR: Varga, this is the Doctor. Are you going to retreat, or shall I fire
again? The trouble is I dare not use it again. If it hasn't killed them all
already, another firing most certainly will. Varga! Answer me or I fire again!

**[Outside the Ioniser control room]**

(The ice warriors stagger out.)  
VARGA: You will die for this.

**[Spacecraft]**

VICTORIA: What are you doing now?  
DOCTOR: Get well back, Victoria.  
VICTORIA: What?  
DOCTOR: Stand by for fireworks. Here we go.  
(The Doctor touches two wires together and the sonic gun control panel
explodes.)  
DOCTOR: Now, quickly. Let's get out of here before they come back. (Later,
while all the humans are still out cold, Zondal wakes.)  
VARGA: The gun is useless.

**[Outside the Ioniser control room]**

DOCTOR: Victoria, see if you can find Jamie.  
VICTORIA: Doctor, Jamie's in there. He's alive!  
DOCTOR: Oh thank goodness for that. Now you get back to the Tardis, and close
the doors.  
(The Doctor waves the remains of the ammonium sulphate under Penley's nose. It
wakes him.)  
DOCTOR: Sorry about that. Up you get. Come along.  
PENLEY: What happened? Did you do that?  
DOCTOR: No time for questions. Come along.

**[Spacecraft]**

VARGA: So, you allowed them to trick you.  
ZONDAL: I await your punishment, Commander.  
VARGA: We have no time. Everything depends on being ready to break free from
the ice as soon as they evaporate it.

**[Ioniser control room]**

DOCTOR: Up you get. Come along, Miss Garrett. There you are.  
GARRETT: Oh, the ioniser. They made me disconnect it.  
DOCTOR: Then it must be switched on again immediately.  
GARRETT: I don't take orders from you.  
CLENT: Miss Garrett, if we are to obey Computer Control, it must be
reconnected. Do so, please.  
GARRETT: Yes, of course.  
DOCTOR: Clent, their spacecraft is powered by an ion reactor.  
CLENT: Well, that means we dare not use the ioniser at full force. That's our
last chance gone.  
PENLEY: Why, for heavens sake?  
CLENT: Because of the risk, man. You know what would happen.  
DOCTOR: Of course there's a risk, but it's a risk we must take. It's the only
way!  
PENLEY: Exactly.  
CLENT: The computer says no!  
PENLEY: The computer  
CLENT: Is our supreme advisor.  
PENLEY: And what sort of advice is that. Do nothing?  
GARRETT: We must obey!  
PENLEY: And be destroyed? Has the computer considered that?  
CLENT: The computer considers everything.  
DOCTOR: But that's why in this case you cannot rely on its judgement!  
GARRETT: We trust the computer. It is our strength and our guide.  
DOCTOR: Not this time.  
JAMIE: Well, why not?  
DOCTOR: Because Jamie, the computer is faced with an insoluble problem. Either
way it risks destroying itself and this it cannot do. It must play safe.  
JAMIE: Aye, but if it does nothing that's just as bad.  
DOCTOR: I'll explain to you another time, Jamie.  
PENLEY: There's only one way out.  
CLENT: What?  
PENLEY: We must over-ride the computer.  
GARRETT: You can't do that!  
PENLEY: We must. This is a decision for a man to take, not a machine. The
computer isn't designed to take risks, but that is the essence of man's
progress. We must decide.  
CLENT: But if you do that you'll soon ruin the world plan. All the ioniser
bases must act together through World Computer Control! If we act too soon
it's as bad as being too late!  
PENLEY: Yes, I know that, but the other bases haven't got a glacier right on
top of them and apart from that what about these ice warriors? If they live
they threaten our entire civilisation.  
DOCTOR: A decision must be taken, and quickly!  
CLENT: I can't.  
GARRETT: I daren't.  
DOCTOR: Penley, it's up to you.  
PENLEY: Well, Clent?  
CLENT: I reserve the right to consult the computer.  
PENLEY: Go ahead.  
CLENT: Problem. Alien spacecraft is powered by an ion reactor. Dare we use the
ioniser? What are the alternatives? Answer.  
(The computer spins and gibbers.)  
JAMIE: It's as though it's gone mad!  
DOCTOR: Well, Penley?  
PENLEY: We will use the ioniser at full strength to turn back the glacier.
Miss Garrett, inform World Control.  
JAMIE: But the spaceship, if you release it from the ice?  
PENLEY: At full strength the ioniser will melt rock.

**[Spaceship]**

ZONDAL: Commander, the glacier is breaking up. Soon we will be free.  
VARGA: What use is our freedom if we are helpless? Our engines must still
dead.  
ZONDAL: I have not given up yet.  
VARGA: Nor I. There must be some life left in the elements.  
ZONDAL: Commander, power.  
VARGA: What? The ice is our friend. We still have power.  
ZONDAL: Shall I increase it?  
VARGA: Carefully. We must time full take-off boost perfectly.  
ZONDAL: And when we are free and in flight, we will be invincible.

**[Ioniser control room]**

CLENT: Instrument readings on the glacier face show a steady rise in
temperature. Now near to maximum.  
JAMIE: Well, do will we know?  
GARRETT: The instruments on the ice face have the highest heat and shock
resistance known to man. When they cease to function, everything about them
will be destroyed.  
CLENT: You're wrong! You're wrong! We'll all be killed!  
PENLEY: It is a risk I willingly take.  
(Penley slides the control down past generator, circuit lock, energy feed to
activator)

**[Spacecraft]**

(The spacecraft is full of smoke.)  
VARGA: It was not power in the engines, Zondal, it was heat. Heat from the
ioniser.  
(The instruments burst into flames.)

**[Ioniser control room]**

(The seismograph shows a small blip.)  
GARRETT: Only a minor explosion. We're safe!  
DOCTOR: Oh. Goodness me!  
PENLEY: Set all circuits to automatic, Miss Garrett, and tie in with the World
Ioniser instrumentation. Clent, will you check these readings with me? And
you've a report to prepare, haven't you?  
CLENT: Yes, yes, yes, I have. Penley, you are the most insufferably irritating
and infuriating person I've ever been privileged to work with.  
PENLEY: Thank you.  
CLENT: Can't write a report though, can you? Something I've got to do for you.
Well don't worry, it's something that I've been trained to do.  
PENLEY: Without the computer?  
CLENT: Now, Penley, I've always written my own speeches and my own reports.  
PENLEY: Are you going to include? Well, where's the Doctor?  
(We hear the sound of the Tardis dematerialising.)
