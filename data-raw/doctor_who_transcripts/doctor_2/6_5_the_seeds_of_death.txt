**[T Mat Earth Control]**

COMPUTER: Bombay Tokyo shipment activated. Bombay sending now. Tokyo receiving
now. Dispatch completed. New York to Moscow delayed. Moonbase clearance
awaited. Stockholm Washington personnel transportation. Stockholm sending now.
Washington receiving now. Dispatch completed. Non-arrival shipment of
synthetic protein New York to Moscow. Moonbase clearance awaited.  
KELLY: Brent?  
BRENT: Yes, Miss Kelly?  
KELLY: Why is there a delay at Moon Control?  
BRENT: There's some mix up with the Moscow shipment. It seems to have landed
up in Canberra.  
KELLY: Fewsham again, I suppose? Take Moscow out of phase while they sort it
out.  
BRENT: Moscow pending. Moonbase clear.  
COMPUTER: Toronto Calcutta shipment activated. Toronto sending now. Calcutta
receiving now. Dispatch completed.  
BRENT: Moscow ready now, Miss Kelly.  
KELLY: Report Canberra Moscow situation, please.  
COMPUTER: Canberra Moscow clear.  
KELLY: Brent, tell them to activate.  
BRENT: Canberra Moscow, go ahead please.  
COMPUTER: Canberra sending now. Moscow receiving now. Dispatch completed.  
(A man beams into a teleport cubicle and there is a chime. He strides across
the floor swinging his briefcase.)  
OSGOOD: Good morning, Gia.  
KELLY: Morning. Just as well you've arrived.  
OSGOOD: Why, what's up?  
KELLY: The sooner you take over from Fewsham on Moon Control, the better.  
OSGOOD: Oh, not again!  
KELLY: All T-Mat consignments are five minutes behind schedule.  
OSGOOD: What?  
KELLY: Fewsham routed a large Moscow consignment through to Canberra.  
OSGOOD: Oh, he's a lunatic.  
KELLY: You should never have recommended him for an Assistant Controller's job
in the first place.  
OSGOOD: Yes, I know now, but I thought he deserved a break.  
KELLY: Sentimental. He'll do something really disastrous one day and you'll
have to answer for it.  
OSGOOD: So, I'll go and work in a synthetics factory.  
KELLY: It's your career.  
OSGOOD: So it is. Hey, have you got a T-Mat cubicle ready for me?  
KELLY: Yes. Number six.  
OSGOOD: See you later.  
(Osgood steps into another cubicle.)  
KELLY: Prepare lunar cubicle number six for transport to Moon Control.  
BRENT: Ready and waiting.  
(Osgood blows Kelly a kiss.)  
KELLY: Activate.  
(Osgood vanishes.)  
BRENT: It's lucky he got here before your man arrived.  
KELLY: Yes, he's late. Keep a public T-Mat cubicle open for him.  
BRENT: Right. Local cubicle two holding open.  
KELLY: Report Moonbase situation please.  
COMPUTER: Moonbase clear. Routine shipments transferring on automatic control.
Local arrival cubicle two activating.  
(A silver-haired man steps out.)  
RADNOR: Morning, Brent.  
BRENT: Morning, sir.  
RADNOR: Good morning, Gia. All functioning well?  
KELLY: Of course, Commander Radnor.  
RADNOR: In your case, Miss Kelly, efficiency and charm go hand in hand.  
KELLY: I try to keep things running smoothly.  
RADNOR: Nothing ever goes wrong while you're on duty.  
KELLY: I don't allow it.  
(Radnor goes into his office.)

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

OSGOOD: You may have been on duty all night, Fewsham, but that's no excuse for
this kind of slip-up!  
FEWSHAM: They weren't a major hold ups, just a few minutes.  
OSGOOD: Kelly was going mad back on Earth Control.  
FEWSHAM: She would.  
OSGOOD: Look, I'm sorry, Fewsham, but it's my head in the noose as well, you
know.  
FEWSHAM: I know, I'm sorry.  
OSGOOD: Oh, all right. All right, go on. You'd better get back to Earth.  
(Fewsham goes to a cubicle, but an alarm sounds.)  
OSGOOD: Now what?  
FEWSHAM: The outer door airlocks.  
OSGOOD: Who's there?  
FEWSHAM: No one.  
OSGOOD: Then how come the airlocks are in use?  
(A man screams just outside the control room. Osgood and Fewsham open the
doors and he falls into their arms.)  
OSGOOD: Phipps! What is it, man? What's happened? Come on, man!  
(Another scream and two more men run in.)  
LOCKE: Close the doors, we've got to keep  
(But what is in the corridor makes them freeze in fear.)  
OSGOOD: Don't move, anybody. Don't do anything. Harvey, don't!  
(The light of a weapon kills Harvey.)

**[T-Mat Earth Control]**

(The Delay light is blinking.)  
BRENT: Not again.  
KELLY: The second Moscow consignment?  
BRENT: Yes. They'll think we're deliberately sabotaging their stuff if this
goes on.  
KELLY: T-Mat reception, Earth to Moon. Controller Kelly calling. Switch your
communication links to video.  
(The video screen is blank.)  
KELLY: Osgood's gone too far this time. There'll be trouble.  

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

OSGOOD: No! I refuse!  
(The unseen visitor speaks with a harsh, hissing voice.)  
SLAAR: You would be wise to co-operate at once, otherwise you will be
destroyed.  
OSGOOD: Well I, I suppose that leaves me no alternative.  
PHIPPS: Don't do it, sir.  
SLAAR: Silence.  
OSGOOD: There's a certain element of risk.  
SLAAR: You are wasting time.  
(Osgood operates some switches under the video screen. Smoke starts pouring
out of the sides.)  
SLAAR: What is happening?  
OSGOOD: I'm afraid there has been a fault. The circuit's overloaded. Very
unfortunate.  
SLAAR: You have deliberately sabotaged this apparatus. Kill him.  
(Osgood turns and gets shot with the alien weapon.)

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

RADNOR: I thought the system was infallible?  
KELLY: It won't be anything serious.  
RADNOR: I'm glad you think so.  
KELLY: Brent, is there any obvious damage?  
BRENT: No damage reported. All links stable.  
RADNOR: That's only local, surely.  
KELLY: It's only one stage of the checking process. Report on Intercity T-Mat
breakdown.  
COMPUTER: Complete power phase blank.  
KELLY: State of materialisation pulse generator?  
COMPUTER: Overloaded in power surge. No damage this end.  
KELLY: Check with Moonbase.  
COMPUTER: Primary video link dead.  
KELLY: Cause?  
COMPUTER: Being investigated.  
RADNOR: Are you sure it isn't serious?  
KELLY: My staff are running a thorough and immediate check. Until I have their
report, I can't answer.  
RADNOR: Then they'd better hurry. I want that report. Soon.

**[Tardis]**

(The Tardis is making materialisation sounds.)  
ZOE: Doctor, if we've landed, where are we?  
DOCTOR: That is what I'm trying to find out, Zoe.  
(The scanner picks up - )  
ZOE: A rocket?  
JAMIE: Hey, we're just hanging in space.  
DOCTOR: We can't be.  
ZOE: Well, let's try and find a star we know.  
(The scanner image swings round to a CCCP space suit.)  
DOCTOR: Ah there we are. What in heavens name?  
JAMIE: Hey, what's he up to?  
ZOE: He's trying to climb aboard.  
DOCTOR: Just a minute, just a minute. Oh this control is. There we are. Now
that, that's an ion-jet rocket of the twenty first century, but, this helmet,
if I can. There we are. That's not nearly so sophisticated. It's certainly not
later than 1960.  
JAMIE: Well, those letters on his helmet?  
ZOE: C C C P.  
JAMIE: Aye.  
DOCTOR: Of course!  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: Just a minute.  
(The Doctor gets the scanner to turn in the opposite direction, and reveals an
old document with backwards writing on it.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think that explains it.  
ZOE: Oh Doctor, what is it?  
DOCTOR: Hmm? Well it's a flying machine, designed by a gentleman by the name
of Leonardo Da Vinci in about 1500.  
JAMIE: Well, what's it doing up here?  
ZOE: Doctor, where are we?  
JAMIE: Aye.  
DOCTOR: We're in a museum!  
JAMIE: A what?  
DOCTOR: A space museum! Look, there you are.  
(Wright Brothers airplane, capsule with an astronaut taking a tethered space
walk, Montgolfier's balloon)  
DOCTOR: A balloon.  
(A Spitfire, a HOTOL style American Airlines plane.)  
DOCTOR: That's a transport plane. And, now those initials, they stand for
Russia. That's Gagarin, the first Earthman in space. Look.  
(A rocket launch, TravelMat Relay over an image of the Moon.)  
DOCTOR: Come on. Let's have a look round, shall we?  
(Jamie and Zoe Leave the Tardis. The Doctor turns back for his jacket.)  
DOCTOR: Just a minute. Wait for me.

**[Space museum]**

(Exhibits include the Astral map from the  Web Planet.)  
JAMIE: Hey, quite a place, isn't it?  
DOCTOR: Oh, my word.  
JAMIE: Hey, look at the size of this one, Doc.  
DOCTOR: Yes. My word, Jamie, look at that.  
ZOE: Oh Doctor, look!  
DOCTOR: Very large.  
ZOE: Doctor, look.  
(The rocket model they first saw on the scanner.  
JAMIE: Hey, look at that.  
(Zoe presses a button on a panel.)  
DOCTOR: Now, Zoe.  
(There is a chime.)  
JAMIE: What's that?  
(A screen drops down on the wall behind them, and an information video plays.)  
MAN [OC]: Travel Mat is the ultimate form of travel. Control centre of the
present system is the Moon, serving receptions at all major cities on the
Earth. Travel Mat provides an instantaneous means of public travel, transports
raw materials and vital food supplies to all parts of the world.  
JAMIE: Travel Mat? It sounds like a flying carpet.  
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie, I'm trying to listen.  
MAN [OC]: Travel Mat supersedes all conventional forms of transport. Using the
principle of dematerialisation at the point of departure, and
rematerialisation at the point of arrival in special cubicles, departure and
arrival are almost instantaneous.  
ZOE: Faster than light.  
MAN [OC]: Although the system is still in its early stages, it completely
automated and foolproof against power failure.  
JAMIE: Aye, well, we have our own system, thank you, only it isn't foolproof.  
DOCTOR: Jamie, I think that's just a tiny bit  
(The Doctor turns and raises his hands in surrender to the weapon pointed at
him. Jamie and Zoe do likewise.)

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

SLAAR: You saw what happened to your superior. You would do well to co-
operate.  
FEWSHAM: Killing him didn't do you any good.  
SLAAR: But you will do as I ask.  
FEWSHAM: There is nothing I can do!  
SLAAR: You do not want to die?  
FEWSHAM: Look, I'm not that good enough a technician. It needs an expert.  
SLAAR: But you are second in command here.  
FEWSHAM: Yes, but  
SLAAR: Then you must have certain abilities. You must know what needs to be
done.  
FEWSHAM: In theory, yes.  
SLAAR: Then you will do it.  
PHIPPS: He'll only make it worse.  
SLAAR: What is their status here?  
FEWSHAM: Maintenance. Second class technicians.  
LOCKE: There's only one person who can really put things to rights, and she's
at Earth Control.  
PHIPPS: Without her, it just can't be done.  
SLAAR: Who is this specialist?  
FEWSHAM: Miss Kelly, technical coordinator. But there's no way to reach her.
T-Mat is not working.  
SLAAR: But you have a video link.  
FEWSHAM: Yes, but Osgood wrecked that too.  
SLAAR: So, there is no means to communicate with Earth?  
PHIPPS: No, you've cut us off completely.  
SLAAR: In that case, you are useless. You will all be destroyed.  
FEWSHAM: No, there's the emergency T-Mat link! It only operates from here to
Earth.  
SLAAR: Then you will activate the apparatus. At once.  
(Fewsham hurries to the controls.)  
FEWSHAM: It's damaged, too!  
SLAAR: These technicians will help you repair it.  
PHIPPS: We won't help you. Neither will he.  
SLAAR: Then he will die. You will start work at once. There will be a guard at
the door. When I return you will have the T-mat link ready for operation.  
(Slaar, who we have not yet seen, leaves.)  
PHIPPS: Don't be such a fool, Fewsham. If we repair the emergency link these
creatures can travel to Earth!  
FEWSHAM: What about us?  
PHIPPS: Do you think that will make any difference in the end? As soon as he
gets what he wants out of us, we'll mean nothing to him.  
FEWSHAM: If we co-operate there's still a chance.  
PHIPPS: Osgood didn't take it.  
FEWSHAM: You saw! Do you think I want to die like that? I want to live!

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

KELLY: Brent, is there anything at all, any trace of a reason?  
BRENT: Every link has been double-checked. This end is functioning normally.  
KELLY: Then it must be Moonbase.  
BRENT: We've no way of checking their apparatus from this end, and they don't
answer our call.  
KELLY: Where's Commander Radnor?  
BRENT: Not back from the Intercity Council meeting yet.  
KELLY: He'll expect a full report.  
BRENT: Well, there it is. We've even checked the computer.  
(Brent gives Kelly a piece of paper and leaves.)  
RADNOR: Have you located the cause of the breakdown?  
KELLY: This end is absolutely clear.  
RADNOR: That isn't what I want to know.  
KELLY: We cannot trace the fault.  
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! I have senior government officials hounding me. They
expect a more informative answer, and so do I.  
KELLY: There isn't one. The trouble is at Moonbase.  
RADNOR: Why can't you deal with it?  
KELLY: We can't get there.  
BRENT: We can't even talk to them.  
RADNOR: Do you mean to tell me that there's no other way of contacting them?  
BRENT: No.  
KELLY: Only by rocket.  
RADNOR: That could be our only answer.  
BRENT: But the only place you'll find a rocket is in a museum.  
RADNOR: Exactly.  
KELLY: And even if there was one that could be made operational, there's no-
one that could control such a project.  
RADNOR: You're wrong. There is just one man, one man alone who can help us
now.

**[Space museum]**

(The weapon is held by an elderly man with a quilted body-warmer over his
clothes.)  
ELDRED: For the last time, who are you and what are you doing in my private
workshop?  
DOCTOR: Now just listen, there really is no need for all these histrionics. We
are perfectly harmless.  
ELDRED: How did you even get in here?  
DOCTOR: Oh well, the usual way. We just materialised.  
ELDRED: The T-Mat cubicle always gives automatic warnings, but it didn't this
time.  
ZOE: Well that's not our fault, is it?  
ELDRED: Why did you come?  
DOCTOR: Well, this is a museum.  
ELDRED: The museum is (sees the Tardis) What on Earth's that? It's a twentieth
century Police Box, isn't it?  
DOCTOR: Well, yes, in a way.  
ELDRED: Well, how did a thing like that get in my museum?  
ZOE: Oh, well you could say it was a form of space ship.  
DOCTOR: Zoe, I think we do owe this gentleman an apology. We really are most
interested in the museum, Mister?  
ELDRED: Eldred, Professor Eldred. Look, the museum is closed to the general
public. You've obviously made a mistake. Perhaps you'd be good enough to
leave.  
JAMIE: Are you in charge of this place?  
ELDRED: I own it. That is why I have the right to ask you to leave.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but there's no need to threaten us, you know.  
ELDRED: Trespassers are not welcome. Will you please go!  
ZOE: We're not trespassers. We're very interested.  
ELDRED: Interested? In Professor Eldred and his antiquated machines? Come for
a good laugh, I suppose, like the rest of them.  
DOCTOR: Laugh? You mean people laugh at all this? Why, it's a magnificent
exhibition.  
ELDRED: We've had enough souvenir hunters, too!  
JAMIE: Now, we're not thieves, you know.  
DOCTOR: No, of course not. We haven't come to take anything. We genuinely are
interested in space travel. Why, especially a thing like this. This is superb.  
ELDRED: Yes, magnificent. It was to have been the vehicle to take man beyond
the moon. T-Mat put an end to all that.  
DOCTOR: You mean this model's been abandoned? But it's speed and stability
concept alone, it's a tremendous advance in rocket design.  
ELDRED: Exactly! Exactly! Here, let me show it to you. Let me show it to you.  
(Eldred puts down his gun and helps the Doctor with the ion jet rocket model.)  
DOCTOR: I'll give you an hand, here we are. Oh yes, this is superb. My word.  
ELDRED: And the secret, the real breakthrough, was a compact generator of
enormous power.  
DOCTOR: I see. And these must be the secondary electrode accelerators.  
ELDRED: Yes. You see it beat the problem of the neutral caesium ions. And
incidentally, it magnified the g-thrust to fantastic proportions!  
DOCTOR: That was awkward. What did you do about that?  
ELDRED: Well, I'll show you. Come with me, I'll show you. Look.  
(Eldred and the Doctor go to the back of the room.)  
DOCTOR: What have we go here? Ah, blueprints!  
JAMIE: Look at them, like a couple of kids.  
ZOE: Yes. You can tell he's almost in love with that rocket.  
JAMIE: Shush!  
ELDRED: That's not surprising. I designed it. I've been in rocketry all my
life. My father engineered the first lunar passenger module, and I travelled
on the last trip back to Earth. Before it all finished.  
ZOE: Before all what finished?  
ELDRED: Space travel.  
ZOE: But if the rocket was so good, why did you stop at the moon?  
JAMIE: Aye, why end there?  
ELDRED: Because of T-Mat. T-Mat, the ultimate in travel. With about as much
sense of adventure as a synthetic carbohydrates factory.  
DOCTOR: But surely rockets would still be useful as an auxiliary means of
transport, wouldn't they? Besides, how would man get beyond the moon?  
ELDRED: Nobody cares any more about exploring space. Life made. Well, it was
made too easy by T-Mat.  
DOCTOR: I see. So you lost government backing?  
ELDRED: The project was abandoned, except by me.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

FEWSHAM: You've got to help me. If we don't repair it, we'll all be killed.  
LOCKE: Maybe we could repair it and T-Mat back to London.  
FEWSHAM: With that thing guarding the door? I'm going to keep on trying.  
LOCKE: Maybe there is something we can do.  
PHIPPS: What?  
FEWSHAM: I knew you'd see reason.  
(Locke goes to the panel Osgood sabotaged.)  
FEWSHAM: What are you doing?  
LOCKE: The video link with Earth. Yes, it's not so badly damaged as the T-Mat.  
FEWSHAM: We were told to repair the T-Mat link, not the video.  
PHIPPS: Let's have a look. If we can't escape ourselves, maybe we can get a
message through by video.  
FEWSHAM: Look, the guard will see what we're doing. He'll kill us!  
LOCKE: You play your game, we'll play ours.

**[Space museum]**

ELDRED: No more money, no more facilities. A life's work abandoned just like
that. All because of T-Mat.  
DOCTOR: Well, I can understand your bitterness. Very short-sighted of the
government to put all their eggs in one basket.  
ELDRED: You still haven't told me who you are and what you're doing here.  
(Beep!)  
DOCTOR: Well.  
ELDRED: That's the main-door alarm! What's going on?  
(Radnor and Kelly enter.)  
RADNOR: Professor Daniel Eldred. Well, well, well.  
ELDRED: Radnor. Come to see how your spies are getting on?  
RADNOR: I'm sorry? I don't think we've met. My name's Radnor. This is Miss
Kelly.  
DOCTOR: Oh, how do you do. This is Zoe, and Jamie, and I'm the Doctor.  
ZOE: Hello.  
JAMIE: Hello.  
ELDRED: Oh, Radnor, don't pretend that you don't know them.  
RADNOR: I can assure you I've never met them before in my life.  
ELDRED: I see. I find three strangers prowling around my museum, and by the
merest co-incidence you turn up on their very heels.  
RADNOR: I can assure you I merely wanted a chat with a very old friend.  
ELDRED: Why? You've done without a chat for a good many years.  
RADNOR: Old times. Friendships don't die.  
ELDRED: Our friendship ended the day that you walked out of my laboratory and
joined the government administration on T-Mat!  
RADNOR: Different men, different careers, Daniel.  
ELDRED: Yes, but you happened to know which career was going to be financed by
government funds.  
RADNOR: But you could have come over with me. We asked you to join us.  
ELDRED: Yes, and worked as Miss Kelly's assistant perhaps?  
KELLY: You know I respect your work, Professor Eldred. We would have welcomed
you on T-Mat.  
ELDRED: I prefer rockets, obsolete as they are.  
RADNOR: Not so obsolete as all that, Daniel, eh?  
ELDRED: What?  
RADNOR: We don't miss very much, you know.  
ELDRED: So you've been spying on me.  
RADNOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. We stopped that a long time ago.  
ELDRED: I should think so. What's wrong with running a private museum?  
RADNOR: Nothing, but you're doing rather more than that, aren't you, Daniel.  
ELDRED: All right, what if I am? It's a free country, isn't it? What's wrong
with having a hobby?  
RADNOR: Rather more than a hobby, preparing an ion rocket for an unauthorised
journey into space.  
ELDRED: All right, so you know. What do you intend to do?  
RADNOR: My dear fellow, help you, of course.  
ELDRED: What?  
RADNOR: You can make your trip with full government backing, as long as it's
to the moon.  
ELDRED: Why the moon?  
KELLY: There's a minor fault developed at T-Mat control at Moonbase.  
RADNOR: And we have to put it right, quickly.  
ELDRED: I thought T-Mat was infallible.  
KELLY: It will be, eventually, however we have no way of reaching the moon.  
ELDRED: Except by out of date rocket. Oh, that's perfect! So you need me after
all.  
RADNOR: I thought you'd be taken with the idea, Daniel. And a large sum of
government funds wouldn't come amiss, would they? Now, how soon can you be
ready to (pause) blast off. Well, come on, it's urgent! Can you give me an
approximate ETD?  
ELDRED: I could.  
RADNOR: Good!  
ELDRED: But I won't!  
RADNOR: Why? There are no strings.  
ELDRED: I don't have to give you reasons. I'm just telling you that I refuse.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

PHIPPS: Right, that should do it.  
LOCKE: I'll switch on the power.  
FEWSHAM: You fools. When they find out, we'll all be killed.  
LOCKE: Moonbase to T-Mat Reception Earth. Moonbase to Earth. Emergency.
Emergency.

**[Space museum]**

RADNOR: You can't refuse, man. There's more at stake here than an out of date
rocket programme.  
COMPUTER: Commander Radnor.  
RADNOR: Excuse me. Radnor.  
COMPUTER: Emergency message from Moonbase linking through now.  
LOCKE [on monitor]: Commander Radnor, Miss Kelly. We are in desperate trouble.
Osgood is dead and we're  
(Transmission ends.)  
RADNOR: Locke! Locke!

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(A green claw rips the video link to pieces. The biped wears a helmet with
large glass pieces in front of its eyes. Its skin is scaly.)  
SLAAR: Guard!  
(Enter an Ice Warrior.)  
SLAAR: Kill him!  
(The Warrior obeys.)

__**Episode Two**__

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(Phipps runs for the door.)  
SLAAR: Stop him.  
(The Warrior fires too late. Phipps is off down the corridor.)  
SLAAR: Hunt that man. He must not escape.  
(The Warrior leaves.)  
SLAAR: You allowed them to send a message back to Earth.  
FEWSHAM: They tricked me! I tried to stop them.  
SLAAR: No matter. He will be found and killed.  
FEWSHAM: What about me?  
SLAAR: Have you repaired the emergency T-Mat link?  
FEWSHAM: Not yet. It isn't easy.  
SLAAR: But it is possible?  
FEWSHAM: Yes, only give me time.  
SLAAR: Very well, but now you know what will happen if you fail. You will die.

**[Space museum]**

RADNOR: Daniel, don't you see this goes far beyond a petty quarrel over
rockets and T-Mat! Those men at Moonbase are in serious trouble and we must
help them.  
ELDRED: You'll have to find some other way.  
KELLY: With T-Mat dead there is no other way. Your rocket is our only hope of
reaching the moon.  
DOCTOR: Professor, listen to them.  
ELDRED: I'm listening.  
DOCTOR: In a way this is a triumph for your rocket.  
ELDRED: Is it?  
RADNOR: Of course it is. The government recognises the fact.  
ELDRED: Then the government is going to be disappointed.  
RADNOR: I don't understand you.  
ELDRED: Oh, I'd better be frank with you.  
RADNOR: Yes, I think you'd better.  
ELDRED: I must admit I played with the idea of making a space flight. I even
prepared a rocket.  
KELLY: Well then?  
ELDRED: It was just a dream, an illusion for a disappointed man.  
KELLY: You mean there's nothing?  
ELDRED: Oh, the rocket's there, partially prepared.  
RADNOR: Good!  
ELDRED: As for an actual lift off  
RADNOR: We can do it, Daniel. I know we can.  
ELDRED: It takes more than enthusiasm to get a rocket off the ground.  
RADNOR: You've only to ask for what you want. Funds, men, equipment.  
ELDRED: It needs the one thing that you have not got. Time.  
KELLY: A crash programme with the best available technicians.  
ELDRED: It's nowhere near ready, woman! Most of the equipment is still
unchecked.  
RADNOR: A computer can be programmed for that.  
ELDRED: It would still be impossibly dangerous.  
RADNOR: Daniel, it was you who created this rocket. It was your driving force
and enthusiasm that got it off the drawing board. With you in control, we
can't fail to succeed.  
ELDRED: That was a long time past. Now my heart couldn't take the strain of
the G-force.  
KELLY: That doesn't mean your experience and knowledge are useless. We need
your guidance.  
ELDRED: No. I told you it's a dream. I can never go to the moon and neither
can rocket ZA685.  
JAMIE: Could we not help them? We could use the Tardis.  
ZOE: What, for a trip to the moon?  
JAMIE: Aye.  
ZOE: We'd probably overshoot by a few million years.  
DOCTOR: Yes, or by a few million miles. I'm afraid the Tardis is not suited to
short-range travel.  
ZOE: Still, I think we should help them if we can.  
JAMIE: Aye.  
DOCTOR: Yes. I think I could get your rocket to the moon.  
ELDRED: You?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I have considerable experience in space travel, and so have my
two companions.  
RADNOR: Doctor, that's splendid. Thank you.  
ELDRED: But the rocket is not ready!  
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps you're overestimating the difficulties. How much more
work is required on your rocket?  
ELDRED: It needs fuelling, and a complete computerised check-up.  
RADNOR: Well, I can order that.  
ELDRED: No! I will not allow it! The risk is too great. No!  
RADNOR: If there was some other way, believe me I wouldn't even consider such
a risk.  
ELDRED: No!  
KELLY: There's always the outside chance that the fault in T-Mat will clear
itself.  
COMPUTER: Commander Radnor. Urgent.  
RADNOR: Excuse me.  
RADNOR: Radnor. Go ahead.  
COMPUTER: T-Mat receptions New York, Moscow, Tokyo express great concern over
continued hold-up. Medical shipments and food supplies awaiting transit to
Asiatic centres. Position desperate, Calcutta. Instructions awaited.  
RADNOR: That's your answer.  
DOCTOR: Well, we're willing to help, as I've said.  
ELDRED: You don't know what you're doing. It's suicide.  
RADNOR: Listen, if this fault lasts much longer, there's going to be worldwide
chaos, and world population is at stake.  
ELDRED: Infallible T-Mat putting the world in jeopardy?  
RADNOR: All right, I admit it.  
ELDRED: And now you want this man to risk his life to get you out of trouble.  
RADNOR: No, not me, but thousands of people all over the world who will die if
we don't take this risk. I'm sorry, but I've got no alternative. Miss Kelly?  
KELLY: Sir?  
RADNOR: I want all technical personnel working on this. I want that rocket
prepared for launching.  
KELLY: Yes, Commander.  
(Kelly leaves.)  
RADNOR: We'd be grateful for your help.  
ELDRED: If that rocket is going to reach the moon safely, you'll need more
than help. You'll need a miracle.

**[Moonbase corridor]**

(The Ice Warrior meets up with another at the junction.)  
WARRIOR: Continue the search. He must not escape.  
(Phipps is hiding behind machinery in the Solar Energy Store Room. A Warrior
enters, looks around, fails to see him and leaves. When the corridor is clear
again, Phipps closes the door and takes a Solar Amplifier out of its box.)

**[Space museum]**

(Everyone is writing on clipboards.)  
KELLY: Commander?  
RADNOR: Yes, Miss Kelly?  
KELLY: Do you think it's wise letting these people crew the rocket?  
RADNOR: Wise? No, of course it's not wise, but what's the alternative? We gave
up training astronauts years ago.  
KELLY: But who are they?  
RADNOR: Some of Eldred's crazy friends, I imagine. But the man who calls
himself the Doctor certainly knows his space travel.  
KELLY: How can you be sure?  
RADNOR: Well, you wanted the briefing, but he and the girl know more about
space flight than Eldred.  
KELLY: What about the boy?  
RADNOR: Yes, I'm not sure about him. Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes?  
RADNOR: Tell me, are all three of you planning to crew this rocket?  
JAMIE: Oh aye. I can be useful too, you know.  
DOCTOR: Jamie, I hadn't thought about you.  
JAMIE: Hey, you're not leaving me behind and that's final.  
ELDRED: There can be no excess weight on this trip.  
JAMIE: Well, how much many this rocket thing hold?  
ELDRED: Well it was designed for a three man crew.  
JAMIE: Ah. Well then, I'm going.  
KELLY: Commander?  
RADNOR: Yes, Miss.  
KELLY: The chemical fuel reserve stocks at launching site are barely adequate
for a moon journey and return.  
RADNOR: What about other sources of supply?  
KELLY: New York and Moscow. Transit impossible due to T-Mat malfunction.  
DOCTOR: But surely it's only a question of getting to the moon. We shall come
back by T-Mat, won't we?  
RADNOR: Possibly. Depends what's wrong with it.  
ELDRED: There is another source of supply.  
RADNOR: Oh, what's that?  
ELDRED: The fuel dump on the moon. There's a refuelling system connected to
the landing bay.  
RADNOR: But surely that equipment hasn't been used for years.  
ELDRED: Neither has the radio homing beam, and if that doesn't work you'll
never make a landing at all.  
JAMIE: Oh, in that case we needn't worry about getting back.  
ELDRED: Well, all the equipment has been completely automated and solar
powered. Designed all myself. No reason why it shouldn't work.  
DOCTOR: I'm sure it will.  
ELDRED: Are you sure you remember all that I told you at the briefing?  
DOCTOR: Oh yes, and even if I don't, Zoe has total recall.  
ELDRED: Well, just in case, I've written it all down here.  
DOCTOR: There's no need, we.  
ELDRED: And there's a map of Moonbase, too. Now, you know how to operate the
homing beam?  
DOCTOR: Now don't worry about a thing. Your rocket is going to be in good
hands.  
JAMIE: Ahem.  
DOCTOR: That's quite enough, Jamie.  
ELDRED: And remember you've only got enough food and water for three days.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well we've taken (conversation carries on in background)  
KELLY: Commander?  
RADNOR: Yes, Miss Kelly?  
KELLY: I think I should go as crew on the rocket.  
RADNOR: Don't be ridiculous. You're too valuable here.  
KELLY: But how can T-Mat be repaired if I'm not there?  
RADNOR: Well, what about the other technicians already there?  
KELLY: Osgood's dead.  
RADNOR: Yes, well, what about Fewsham? Phipps?  
KELLY: Oh, he's incapable of repairing it. I think I should go.  
RADNOR: No! You're the only one who really understands T-Mat. I can't have you
risking your life.  
KELLY: And yet you're perfectly prepared to allow them to risk theirs.  
DOCTOR: Now don't worry, Miss Kelly. We're going to be perfectly all right.  
KELLY: But how can you be sure? You don't even know what the trouble is up
there.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(Fewsham is still working on the control panel. Two Warriors stand guard.)  
SLAAR: The emergency link with Earth, is it ready yet?  
FEWSHAM: I've nearly finished.  
SLAAR: Do not make any mistakes.  
FEWSHAM: I am not an expert.  
SLAAR: But you will do it.  
FEWSHAM: Yes! But I don't see what good just this emergency link can be. Even
if you had a gigantic army of warriors, you couldn't send them all to conquer
Earth.  
SLAAR: We do not need an army. Earth will be ours for the taking, very soon.  
(In the Solar Energy Store Room, Phipps looks around for something, then finds
an infra-red lamp. He plugs it into the Solar Amplifier then hunts for the
Solar Power Line. It is hidden behind some old canisters.)

**[Rocket]**

ELDRED [on monitor]: Ignition reserve power.  
ZOE [OC]: Fully charged.  
KELLY [on monitor]: Internal atmosphere settings?  
DOCTOR [OC]: All normal.  
ELDRED [on monitor]: Trajectory bearings, orbital lock.  
ZOE [OC]: Pre-set registering normal functions.

**[Mission control]**

(A few tables and microphones in a room at the museum.)  
KELLY: Lift off activation check complete. All readings alpha green.  
RADNOR: Well done. In record time and not a thing wrong.  
ELDRED: So far.  
RADNOR: Doctor?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes?  
RADNOR: Final check on procedure after you land.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh yes, I know. We're to re-establish video link with the Earth.  
RADNOR: That's right. When we can see what's wrong, you can do the rest under
Miss Kelly's supervision.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Right. We're ready when you are.  
KELLY: Link programme to telemeter guidance. KELLY: Three minutes. Countdown
will begin at T minus sixty seconds.  
RADNOR: This is it.  
(ZA685 stands alone on its launch pad. No gantry, no feeder lines, nothing.)  
KELLY: All functions are on computer controlled pre-set. Clear launching site.

**[Rocket]**

(The crew capsule is suitably cramped.)  
ZOE: Three minutes seems an awfully long time.  
DOCTOR: Yes. You remember your take off briefing, Jamie?  
JAMIE: Aye, he's told me all about this G-force stuff. Now I know.  
ZOE: You don't know about it until you've experienced it.  
JAMIE: Look Zoe, I'll have you know that the Doctor and I have  
KELLY [OC]: T minus sixty seconds from now.  
DOCTOR: There's one minute to go. Now hold tight, everyone.  
ZOE: Well, I'm all right, Doctor. How about you, Jamie?  
JAMIE: (scared) Look, I keep telling you, I'm fine.  
KELLY [OC]: T minus fifty.

**[Mission control]**

ELDRED: Make sure telemeter guidance is operative!  
RADNOR: Don't worry, everything's been checked and rechecked.  
KELLY: T minus forty. Technicians report.  
BRENT [OC]: All areas clear.  
ELDRED: Check all systems.  
KELLY: We have.  
ELDRED: We must make sure.  
KELLY: T minus thirty. Twenty six.

**[Rocket]**

KELLY [OC]: Twenty two. Eighteen. Fourteen. Twelve. Ten.

**[Mission control]**

KELLY: Ten, nine, eight, Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. We have lift
off.  
(Archive footage of a Saturn V heading for the stratosphere.)  
RADNOR: I never thought I'd see that again. A rocket rising in flight.  
ELDRED: Beautiful! Let's see how they are. The link is dead!  
KELLY: What? Something must have gone wrong on lift off.  
RADNOR: Try the shadow channel.  
KELLY: Nothing.  
RADNOR: Do you mean to say we're out of touch completely?  
ELDRED: What about radio link?  
KELLY: Earth control to rocket. How do you read me? Over.  
ELDRED: Nothing but static.  
RADNOR: It's only a minor fault, surely.

**[Rocket]**

(Weightless but still strapped into their seats.)  
KELLY [OC]: Earth control to rocket. How do you read me? Earth control to
rocket.  
ZOE: Don't release your safety straps until I switch over to automatic gravity
control, otherwise you'll float away.  
KELLY [OC]: Earth control to rocket, how do you read me?  
ZOE: Oh, wait a minute! Switching to automatic gravity control now.

**[Mission control]**

ELDRED: Try again.  
KELLY: Earth control to rocket.  
ZOE [OC]: Rocket to Earth Control. Wait a minute, can't you? We've only just
recovered from take-off.  
ELDRED: Is everything all right? We seem to have lost our video monitor link.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, I think there must be a fault in one of the circuits.  
ELDRED: Doctor? Doctor?

**[Rocket]**

(Smoke is coming from a panel.)  
ZOE: What is it?  
DOCTOR: Well, one of the circuits has burnt out, Zoe. I'll switch to a
secondary one.  
JAMIE: Oh, no. This is worse than the Tardis.

**[Mission control]**

ELDRED: Do you read me, Doctor?  
KELLY: Sounds as though the entire communications circuitry has blown out.  
ELDRED: Yes, let's hope that's all that's happened.  
RADNOR: Keep trying, Miss Kelly.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

FEWSHAM: It's done. The emergency link will work now.  
SLAAR: Excellent!  
FEWSHAM: What are you going to do?  
SLAAR: Do not ask questions. Activate the link. On receive only.  
FEWSHAM: Receive? But aren't you going to send anybody  
SLAAR: Activate the link on receive at once!

**[Mission control]**

KELLY: And you've double checked everything?  
BRENT [on monitor]: Yes. The fault is definitely at Moonbase.  
RADNOR: Is it possible for you to effect repairs over video?  
KELLY: Provided the fault is not too major.  
ELDRED: And provided they actually get there in the rocket.  
RADNOR: They'll get there.  
ELDRED: Why? How do you know? You can't even be sure the rocket's still in one
piece.  
BRENT [on monitor]: Miss Kelly!  
KELLY: What is it, Brent?  
BRENT [on monitor]: We've got through. The emergency T-Mat link to Moon
Control is activating.  
KELLY: Is someone coming through?  
BRENT [on monitor]: No, it's on send.  
KELLY: Moonbase must have managed to make a temporary repair.  
RADNOR: It seems odd.  
KELLY: That's all we need. Brent, have a full emergency kit waiting. I'll join
you as soon as possible.  
BRENT [on monitor]: Yes, Miss Kelly. Crew are standing by.  
RADNOR: Where do you think you're going?  
KELLY: Well, if we can send, it's the only thing I can do.  
RADNOR: You've no idea what conditions are like up there.  
KELLY: I know all too well what they're like down here. And it's my job to put
things right.  
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! You cannot assume that responsibility without
authorisation.  
KELLY: Commander, you've stopped me once. Please don't try it again, otherwise
I shall have to go above your head.  
(Kelly leaves.)  
ELDRED: She's after your job, Julian.  
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! She's a fool. If we lose her, nothing can save us.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(In the store room, Phipps has got three infra red lamps set up, pointing at
the middle of the room, and plugged into the amplifier. He plugs that into the
solar power line.)  
(Meanwhile, in the main control room, Fewsham staring at the T Mat cubicle and
waiting. Kelly and two technicians appear.)  
FEWSHAM: Thank heavens you've come.  
KELLY: What happened?  
FEWSHAM: Osgood. It must have been space madness. He just went berserk, raving
mad. It was terrifying.  
KELLY: Osgood? But he'd be the last man I'd have thought  
FEWSHAM: So did we.  
KELLY: Where are the others?  
FEWSHAM: When Osgood fused the controls, Locke tried to stop him. Osgood
killed him.  
KELLY: This is fantastic! What about Phipps?  
FEWSHAM: Well, he was injured too. I've put him under sedation.  
KELLY: And you?  
FEWSHAM: There's nothing wrong with me.  
KELLY: You look frightened.  
FEWSHAM: If you'd seen Osgood die, wouldn't you be?  
KELLY: How did he die?  
FEWSHAM: His body's outside. He just went out.  
KELLY: Without a pressure suit? I see. Open all control sections and computer
links. Fewsham, what are you doing?  
FEWSHAM: I thought I'd best switch off the emergency link. With the trouble
we've got it could easily burn itself out.  
KELLY: Sensible. Anyway, it'll prevent Commander Radnor sending up a security
guard to drag me back to Reception Earth.  
(Out of sight of the humans, Slaar gives his Warrior the usual order.)  
SLAAR: The other human is still free. Find him. He must not interfere with our
plans.

**[Solar Energy Store Room]**

(Phipps has found a transmitter unit, and unplugs the infra-red array to power
it.)  
PHIPPS: Hello, Earth Control this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. How do
you read me? Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Can you hear
me?  
(Phipps takes the back off the transmitter unit.)

**[Rocket]**

ZOE: It's no use. No contact at all. Every circuit's dead.  
DOCTOR: Oh dear, this is most unfortunate.  
JAMIE: Aye, well don't try them again. You may blow the whole rocket up next
time.  
ZOE: Well, there's no use worrying about the radio now. We're nearly at the
end of the journey.  
DOCTOR: Well I had hoped we could stay in contact with Earth.  
ZOE: We don't need them. All we have to do is activate the Moon homing beam.  
JAMIE: Well, how do you do that? I thought we weren't in contact with anyone
on the Moon?  
ZOE: Well, it's quite simple, Jamie. It's an automatic device. We send out
code radio signals which triggers the homing beacon into action. We
automatically lock onto it until we reach the point in orbit where we fire
retro-rockets to land.  
JAMIE: Oh. Ah, but if they've all been cut off, how can they activate?  
DOCTOR: It works off a different power source, Jamie. Solar power. It's
independent of the T-Mat system.  
JAMIE: Aye well, I just hope it works, that's all.  
ZOE: Well, if it doesn't we're going to have trouble docking at Moon Control
airlock. It could be quite a crash.  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: Well, lets try, shall we? I think we're near enough. There, that's our
activating signal.  
ZOE: That's it. As long as that note is steady, we're home and dry, no trouble
at all.

**[Solar Energy Store Room]**

(The homing beam light has lit up on the wall.)  
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you
hear me? Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you
hear me?  
(A Warrior in the corridor hears Phipps raise his voice.)  
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control. This is Moonbase. Emergency! Can you hear me?
Hello Earth Control. This is Moonbase. Can you hear me?  
(The Warrior enters.)  
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control.  
(Phipps hears the Warrior behind him and quickly swaps the transmitter power
for the infra red array. The room is filled with the light, and when Phipps
switches off again, the Ice Warrior is just a dirty patch on the floor. Phipps
plugs the transmitter back in.)  
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control. This is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you
hear me?  
(The light on the rocket homing beam indicator has gone out.)

**[Rocket]**

ZOE: The homing beam, it's cut out!  
DOCTOR: I know, I know. I'm trying to re-activate it.  
JAMIE: What's gone wrong? I thought you said it was infallible?  
DOCTOR: Well, the solar power source must have been damaged, Jamie.  
JAMIE: You said we'd have trouble if that didn't work!  
DOCTOR: Yes. Without the beam it'll be impossible to land safely.  
JAMIE: You mean we'll crash?  
ZOE: Well, either that or drift on endlessly through space.

__**Episode Three**__

**[Solar Power Store Room]**

PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control. This is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you
hear me?

**[Rocket]**

ZOE: At our present rate of drift and allowing for the usual gravitational
influences, we'll be drawn into the heart of the sun in approximately five
months and ten days.  
JAMIE: No need to worry about that, then.  
ZOE: What do you mean?  
JAMIE: We've only got enough food and water for three days, remember? (The
Doctor hears something over his headset.)  
DOCTOR: Just a minute. I think I'm getting something.  
PHIPPS [OC]: Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can
you hear me?  
DOCTOR: Hello, Moonbase. Can you hear me?

**[Solar Energy Store Room]**

PHIPPS: Yes! Yes, I can hear you load and clear. What part of Earth are you
speaking from?  
DOCTOR [OC]: We're not on the Earth. We're in a rocket orbiting the moon.  
PHIPPS: A rocket? But that's impossible!

**[Rocket]**

DOCTOR: Well I can assure you it's not impossible. What is your emergency?
What's happening on Moonbase?  
PHIPPS [OC]: We've been invaded. Aliens have taken over.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

KELLY: Put that cover back on. Right, let's test it now.  
FEWSHAM: Do you really think it will work?  
KELLY: No reason why not. We've replaced the overloaded circuits. It should be
all right. Turn on the power. Hold it.  
(Kelly adjusts something near the monitor.)  
KELLY: Try again. We'll T-Mat back to Earth and report to Commander Radnor.  
SLAAR: Stop! You will remain here.  
(Ice Warriors hem them in.)  
FEWSHAM: Don't move! Do exactly as they say!  
(A technician runs for the T-Mat cubicle and gets killed. The other tackles a
warrior and also dies.)  
SLAAR: You will remain here.

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

RADNOR: Brent, has contact be re-established with Moonbase yet?  
BRENT: No, sir. As soon as Miss Kelly was transmitted the emergency link
switched off again.  
ELDRED: And you've no idea what's happened?  
BRENT: Oh, I'm sure Miss Kelly will sort things out all right.  
RADNOR: I wish I had your optimism.

**[Rocket]**

DOCTOR: How much longer, Zoe?  
ZOE: Well, our orbit will bring us back into his range in approximately forty
three seconds.  
DOCTOR: Let's hope he can still transmit.  
ZOE: Well, his signal was quite strong when we were orbiting his side of the
moon. There's no reason for it to fade.  
DOCTOR: It's not his equipment I'm worried about, it's his survival.  
ZOE: Doctor, these aliens he described.  
DOCTOR: How much did you hear?  
ZOE: Bipeds, reptilian, armed with some kind of sonic device.  
JAMIE: Yes, Ice Warriors.  
ZOE: What?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Jamie and I have met them before. They come from the planet
Mars.  
ZOE: Well, what do they want?  
DOCTOR: Mars is a dying planet. I imagine they're trying to find a new home.  
ZOE: Why the Moon?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I think that that's just a stepping stone.  
ZOE: What did you they were? Ice Warriors?  
JAMIE: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Well Mars, as you know, is a cold planet. They've adapted to
that. It's heat they can't stand.  
ZOE: We should just about be coming into range now.  
DOCTOR: Hello Moonbase, hello Moonbase. Can you read me?  
PHIPPS [OC]: Yes, I read you loud and clear.  
DOCTOR: Oh thank heavens for that. Now listen. We need your help to make a
landing.  
PHIPPS [OC]: But you mustn't land. You must warn Earth about what's happened
here.  
DOCTOR: We can't do that. We've lost radio contact with the Earth.  
PHIPPS [OC]: Well then, go back and warn them.  
DOCTOR: We can't do that either. We haven't got enough fuel. We need to get to
the fuel dump on the moon.  
PHIPPS [OC]: But they'll kill you!  
DOCTOR: Oh well, we'll just have to take that risk. Now, where are you Mister,
er, what's?  
PHIPPS [OC]: Phipps. I'm in the Solar Energy Store. Now, what do you want me
to do?  
ZOE: Doctor, if we could adapt our homing equipment to his radio signal, we
could beam in on that.  
DOCTOR: Did you hear that? We want you to keep your transmitter going.  
PHIPPS [OC]: All right, I'll try, but I've no idea how long this transmitter
can last.  
(The Doctor fastens some wires together.)  
DOCTOR: There, I think that's done it. Now then, let's see if we can pick up
his signal.  
(Beep beep beep.)  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, there we are. Now, Zoe, what about the approach trajectory?  
ZOE: Yes, here.  
DOCTOR: Ah good. Oh yes. Oh, I don't think I could have done better myself.  
ZOE: We need to fire the retro-rockets in seventeen point five seconds.  
DOCTOR: What? Well, landing positions, everyone.  
(They turn their seats around.)  
ZOE: Two seconds, one, now.  
(The Doctor flicks the Retro Rockets switch and the craft turns to head tail
first for the moon.)  
ZOE: Let's hope there's enough fuel left to cushion down on.  
JAMIE: Aye, and let's hope that radio beam thing doesn't conk out before we
get there.  
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Jamie. I'm sure we're going to be all right.

**[Solar Energy Store Room]**

PHIPPS: Hello Moon rocket. Can you hear me?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Hello Moonbase. Yes, we can. We are coming in on your signal now.
Whatever you do, keep transmitting.  
(One of the diodes on top of the transmitter goes out. Of course.)

**[Rocket]**

DOCTOR: The signal! It's stopped!  
ZOE: Can you get us back into orbit?  
DOCTOR: No! No, I shall have to get us down as best I can.  
ZOE: But if we crash into a mountain range, we'll be smashed to pieces!  
(Phipps replaces the failed diode.)  
ZOE: It's working again. Doctor, can you lock back onto it?  
DOCTOR: Well, I'll try. Yes, yes, there it is. Oh, my word. I think we're
going to be all right.  
(The entire craft comes down vertically onto the Moonbase pad with something
of a bump.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'm sorry about the landing. Is everyone all right?  
JAMIE: Aye, well, we're down, that's that main thing.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
ZOE: Now what do we do?  
DOCTOR: Well, the first we must do is to refuel. You can see to that, Zoe,
can't you.  
ZOE: Yes, but what are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: Well I must go in search of Mister Phipps.  
ZOE: But what about the Ice Warriors?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I've met them before.  
ZOE: But Doctor, you can't just go  
DOCTOR: Well I've got to rescue Mister Phipps, now haven't I? Now where did I
put that map of. Ah. Here we are. Now then, the Solar Power room is. Here we
are. Oh yes. Oh yes, that seems to be quite a simple route.  
JAMIE: Right, I'll come with you.  
DOCTOR: No. You'll stay here and look after Zoe. Now don't worry, you're going
to be quite all right.  
JAMIE: Ah.  
DOCTOR: Good luck.  
ZOE: And to you.  
JAMIE: And to you.  
(The Doctor leaves the capsule.)  
JAMIE: Well, how do we refuel?  
ZOE: Oh, well, that's simple. It'll connect automatically from here. Now you
watch this dial, and when it reads full, switch it off. Now do you think you
can remember that?  
JAMIE: Of course I can.  
ZOE: Good. I want to have a look at the rocket motors.  
JAMIE: Why, what's the matter?  
ZOE: Well I didn't much like the way we landed. It could have caused some
damage.  
JAMIE: Well, I know it was a bit rough, but surely it wasn't as bad as all
that?  
(Jamie helps her down a service ladder.)  
ZOE: Well, it's not the landing that matters now, it's the take-off.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(Fewsham is pressing buttons next to city names.)  
FEWSHAM: Tokyo. London. Canberra. That's the lot. The whole system's
completely operational again.  
SLAAR: We can now send to any city in the world?  
FEWSHAM: Yes, anywhere there's a T-Mat centre.  
KELLY: Fewsham, do you realise what you're doing?  
FEWSHAM: I'm trying to save our lives.  
KELLY: And what about the people on Earth?  
FEWSHAM: We're in no position to argue.  
KELLY: Why do you want control of T-Mat? If you're going to invade the Earth,
you'll be fighting the armed forces of the entire world. You'll never succeed.
There'll be too much resistance.  
SLAAR: There will be no resistance.  
FEWSHAM: What about us? What'll happen to us?  
SLAAR: You will remain alive as long as you are useful.  
KELLY: You'll never get any help from me.  
SLAAR: When the time comes you will do exactly what you are told, or die.

**[Solar Energy Store Room]**

(The Doctor sneaks down corridors, following his map. He taps on the store
room door and enters.)  
DOCTOR: Hello?  
(Phipps comes out from behind a box, wrench in hand.)  
PHIPPS: Who are you?  
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh, Mister Phipps, I presume?  
PHIPPS: Yes, but where'd you come from?  
DOCTOR: From the rocket. We were talking on the radio.  
PHIPPS: Thank heavens you made it. Are the others here too?  
DOCTOR: No, they're still in the rocket. How many of the Ice Warriors are
there?  
PHIPPS: These creatures, you mean?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
PHIPPS: Well, there aren't many, but they're deadly.  
DOCTOR: Oh, they have their weak points.  
PHIPPS: Look, they've killed everybody here. All except Fewsham. He's helping
them.  
DOCTOR: I see. Well, there's only one thing for it. We shall have to destroy
T-Mat.  
PHIPPS: What!

**[Rocket]**

JAMIE: Are you all right, Doctor?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes. Have you refuelled the rocket, Jamie?  
JAMIE: Yes, we've just finished and Zoe's checking the rocket motors.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh good. I have found Mister Phipps.  
JAMIE: How is he?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh, he's quite all right but  
JAMIE: Aye, and you're bringing him back now?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, eventually, Jamie, but I've got to put T-Mat out of action
first.  
JAMIE: But, but, but Doctor, what about the Ice Warriors?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Now, don't worry. Jamie. You and Zoe prepare the rocket for take
off and wait for us. Goodbye.  
JAMIE: But Doctor. Doctor. Hey! Och.  
(Zoe climbs up into the capsule.)  
JAMIE: That was the Doctor. He's found Phipps and he wants us to prepare the
rocket for take off while they put T-Mat out of action.  
ZOE: But he can't!  
JAMIE: Why?  
ZOE: I've just checked the main power drive and the rocket's motors are
completely useless.  
JAMIE: What?  
ZOE: The only way back to Earth is by T-Mat.  
JAMIE: Oh!  
ZOE: Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me? This is Zoe. Doctor! Oh he must have
switched off!  
JAMIE: Oh, now what do we do?  
ZOE: We'll go and find him. Come on.

**[Moonbase corridor]**

DOCTOR: Where is this leading to?  
PHIPPS: Control Headquarters. Through this way.  
(Round a corner they see a Warrior with Kelly in its painful grasp.)  
DOCTOR: It's an Ice Warrior. It's got Miss Kelly. But how?  
(The Warrior aims its weapon at them.)  
DOCTOR: Run!  
(Phipps and the Doctor run different ways. Kelly gets free of the Warrior and
runs after Phipps. The Doctor reappears and tackles the Warrior before leading
it off on a diversion through various corridors. Just as he thinks he has lost
it, two more are in front of him. He runs back through an area of mirrored
panels that cast lots of reflections until he is trapped in front of a locked
door.)  
DOCTOR: Stop!  
WARRIOR: You must be destroyed.  
DOCTOR: You've got no orders to kill me. Your leader will want to speak to me!  
WARRIOR: Humans are our enemies!  
DOCTOR: But I can be useful to you, like Fewsham. Your leader will be angry if
you kill me. I'm a genius.  
WARRIOR: Genius? You will come with me.  
(Meanwhile, Jamie and Zoe don't have the benefit of a map.)  
JAMIE: Now which way?  
ZOE: I don't know. I'm lost.  
JAMIE: I thought you knew the way.  
ZOE: So did I. Let's try this way.  
JAMIE: Women!  
(They come to another junction.)  
JAMIE: Oh, no. We could wander around here all day.  
ZOE: Listen! Quick, here!  
(They hide behind a stanchion as a Warrior comes past.)  
ZOE: What was that thing?  
JAMIE: An Ice Warrior. You see, we were right.  
(The Warrior turns.)  
JAMIE: Quick, run.  
(Jamie and Zoe run down another corridor and hide again.)  
ZOE: Get back. Don't move.  
(The Warrior looks down the corridor then takes another one.)  
JAMIE: Now what do we do?  
ZOE: Keep looking for the Doctor and keep your eyes open for the solar energy
room. Come on.  
JAMIE: Solar energy.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

FEWSHAM: I wish you'd tell me what you want me to do.  
SLAAR: You will shortly dispatch a cargo to certain cities on Earth. They will
include Ottawa, Oslo, Stockholm, Hamburg.  
FEWSHAM: Cargo? What sort of cargo?  
(The Warriors enter with the Doctor.)  
WARRIOR: The prisoner Kelly has escaped. This human was in the corridors.  
SLAAR: Who are you? Where are you from?  
DOCTOR: I might ask you the same question.  
SLAAR: You will find the human Kelly and bring her back here. Who is this man?  
(The Warriors leave.)  
FEWSHAM: He's not one of the crew. I don't know him. He must have just arrived
here.  
SLAAR: Impossible. We control T-Mat. How did you get here?  
DOCTOR: Our resources are not limited to T-Mat, you know.  
SLAAR: You arrived here by other means, by spacecraft?  
FEWSHAM: Rockets haven't been used for years.  
SLAAR: Then you are lying. You have been concealed here all the time.  
DOCTOR: But you can't be sure of that, can you? The people of the Earth may be
preparing a whole fleet of rockets to defend themselves with.  
SLAAR: No. Earth relies entirely on T-Mat. There is no defence against our
plans.  
DOCTOR: And what are your plans? Invasion by T-Mat? There are too few of you
to conquer all the peoples of the Earth.  
(Two Warriors carry an opaque container between them.)  
WARRIOR: The Grand Marshall has ordered all the seeds to be prepared. You are
to receive your instructions.  
SLAAR: Then guard the humans. If they try to escape, kill them.  
(Slaar leaves. The Warriors busy themselves with the container, so the Doctor
speaks quietly to Fewsham.)  
DOCTOR: Why are you helping them?  
FEWSHAM: I've seen what they can do.  
DOCTOR: Do you know what is in that container?  
FEWSHAM: All I know is they want me to send something to Earth by T-Mat. I
suppose that's what's in it.  
DOCTOR: Then I shall have to have a look inside, and you are going to help me.

**[Solar Energy Store Room]**

ZOE: The Doctor's been captured? But couldn't you help him?  
PHIPPS: I'm sorry. There was nothing we could do.  
KELLY: We had a job to reach here ourselves.  
JAMIE: Aye, so did we.  
ZOE: Are you sure the Ice Warriors don't know about this place?  
PHIPPS: Well, one of them did find it, but I managed to deal with him.  
ZOE: How?  
PHIPPS: Well, I fixed up a kind of booby trap to the solar energy power line.  
JAMIE: Ah.  
KELLY: By the look of those things I'd have though they were invulnerable.  
ZOE: No. The Doctor said they can't stand heat.  
JAMIE: Aye, that's right.  
PHIPPS: The heating system of the entire base is controlled from the Centre.
Now if we could reach those controls and turn up the heating.  
ZOE: But how can we get there? There are Ice Warriors patrolling those
corridors.  
JAMIE: Aye.  
PHIPPS: Yes I know. The maintenance tunnels. Over here.  
(A grill in the wall.)  
JAMIE: Hey, if we could get through here, then turn the heating up, knock the
Warriors out, we could rescue the Doctor.  
KELLY: And T-Mat ourselves back to Earth.  
JAMIE: Aye.  
ZOE: But I thought T-Mat had broken down?  
KELLY: Not anymore. I repaired it. How can we get this cover off?  
PHIPPS: This part of the base hasn't been used for ages. It's rusted solid.
It'll take some time.  
JAMIE: Aye, well, the Doctor may not have much time.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

DOCTOR: (sotto) All right, Fewsham. Now.  
FEWSHAM: I can't! They'll kill us both!  
DOCTOR: You have got to help me.  
FEWSHAM: I said I can't.  
DOCTOR: Very well, I shall do it by myself. If I'm caught, which is most
likely, we will both get killed.  
FEWSHAM: All right.  
(Fewsham walks past a Warrior.)  
WARRIOR: Do not move!  
FEWSHAM: I was ordered to prepare the controls for transmission. I've have got
to check that everything is in order.  
WARRIOR: Return to where you were.  
(The Doctor sneaks over to the container.)  
FEWSHAM: But this is most important!  
WARRIOR: If you are trying to escape, I shall destroy you.  
FEWSHAM: I'm not trying to escape.  
WARRIOR: Go back to where you were.  
FEWSHAM: All right, all right.  
(The Warrior sees the Doctor at the container. We hear it slam shut as the
Doctor turns and raises his hands.)  
SLAAR: Wait! Open it. I said open it!  
(The container is full of six inch spheres.)  
DOCTOR: What are these things? (he picks one up) They look like seed pods.  
(The pod suddenly expands, goes pop and the Doctor coughs on the tiny
particles it releases. He collapses.)  
FEWSHAM: What is it? What's happened to him? Is he dead?

**[Solar Energy Store Room]**

(Phipps and Jamie work at opening the grill to the maintenance tunnels. Zoe
listens at the door.)  
JAMIE: That's it!  
ZOE: I think I heard something.  
KELLY: Be careful!  
(Zoe opens the door and looks out to see a Warrior in the corridor.)  
ZOE: There's one coming. I don't think he saw me.  
JAMIE: We won't take any chances.  
(Jamie jams a metal bar across the sliding door.)  
JAMIE: That should hold it.  
ZOE: Get back!  
(Everyone hides.)  
PHIPPS: Don't move.  
JAMIE: The booby trap thing, does it still work?  
PHIPPS: It'll have to be reconnected.  
JAMIE: Well, come on.  
PHIPPS: Miss Kelly.  
(Kelly plugs the infra red lamps back into the extension cable.)  
PHIPPS: Zoe.  
(Zoe hands him the power plug.)  
JAMIE: (hanging on to the door) Hurry up!  
(Phipps plugs the array into the solar-power line.)  
PHIPPS: Right!  
(Jamie lets go of the door handle and the Warrior enters.)  
KELLY: Now!  
(Phipps throws the switch, and a few seconds later there is another dirty mark
on the floor.)

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(A Warrior carries a seed pod towards the T-Mat.)  
SLAAR: You will prepare to activate the cubicle and transmit to London. Obey!  
(Fewsham sits at the controls.)

**[T-Mat Earth Control]**

COMPUTER: Emergency transport systems now in operation. However situation
still extremely critical in most parts of the world. Primitive areas surviving
best but all major cities now suffering severe food shortages.  
RADNOR: Without T-Mat, millions are going to die, especially in the cities.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

SLAAR: Activate!  
(The seed pod and its elegant stand vanish.)

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

(And appear. No one notices until the device chimes.)  
BRENT: Commander Radnor, the T-Mat is working.  
RADNOR: Working? Kelly must have got through!  
ELDRED: Splendid! What is it?  
(Brent opens the cubicle and touches the pod. It swells up.)  
BRENT: It's alive!  
(The pod continues to swell.)

__**Episode Four**__

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

BRENT: The thing's alive!  
(The pod goes pop and spreads its fine contents into the air. Brent gets a
lungful of it in the cubicle and collapses.)  
ELDRED: Get away from here. Quick, quick!  
(Everyone else runs away, coughing.)  
RADNOR: He's dead. Keep back. It must be that smoke. Guards! Keep away from
here! (the cubicle)  
ELDRED: Use the air conditioning!  
RADNOR: Switch the air conditioning to expel.  
(A technician obeys and the fine smoke or particles are sucked out through the
grill.)  
ELDRED: It seems to be clearing. What was that thing?  
RADNOR: Careful, Daniel.  
ELDRED: It's all right. It's harmless enough now. It's shrivelled up.  
RADNOR: Get Brent's body over to the medical wing. Tell them that I want a
full autopsy.  
(Technicians carry Brent away.)  
RADNOR: Now what do you make of that?  
ELDRED: Ever seen anything like that thing before?  
RADNOR: No. It looked like some sort of seed pod, but why do you think it
exploded like that?  
ELDRED: Some plants reproduce that way. Their pods explode and spread their
seeds.  
RADNOR: All this thing spread was some kind of smoke.  
ELDRED: Which has now been dispelled into the air of London.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(The Ottawa light is flashing. A Warrior brings another pod from the container
to the T Mat cubicle.)  
SLAAR: Prepare to dispatch. Dispatch.  
(The Oslo light flashes and another pod is fetched.)  
SLAAR: Hamburg.  
FEWSHAM: Why are we doing this? What are those things?  
SLAAR: Dispatch!

**[Solar Energy Store Room]**

(Kelly is working on one of the infra red lamps.)  
KELLY: Zoe, would you hold this for a moment? (the bulb)  
ZOE: What is it?  
KELLY: Well, this circuit was overloaded. It blew out when we destroyed that
creature. I'm trying to repair it. Okay.  
(Zoe gives the bulb back.)  
ZOE: Well, this one looks all right.  
KELLY: Let's hope it works.  
ZOE: Well, let's hope we don't need it.  
(Zoe checks the maintenance tunnel.)  
ZOE: There's no sign of them. It isn't getting any warmer, is it.  
KELLY: Well they can't have had time to reach the heating controls yet.  
ZOE: And the heating controls are in the main control room, aren't they.  
KELLY: Yes.  
ZOE: And so are the Ice Warriors.

**[Maintenance tunnel]**

PHIPPS: Are you all right?  
JAMIE: Fine.  
(Phipps and Jamie come to a grill where they can see into the control room and
the T Mat cubicle.)  
SLAAR: Paris. Dispatch!  
(Another pod is on its way.)  
JAMIE: What are they up to?  
PHIPPS: I don't know. It looks as though they're sending something by T-Mat.  
JAMIE: Who's that helping them?  
PHIPPS: Fewsham.  
JAMIE: Hey, can you see the Doctor anywhere?  
PHIPPS: No, there's no sign of him. I wonder what it is they're sending?

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

COMPUTER: The object appeared in reception cubicle T-Mat headquarters. Leading
Technician Douglas D Grant in close proximity to the object collapsed and died
instantly. Cause of death as yet unknown. Message from New York ends.  
RADNOR: That's another one. How many does that make?  
ELDRED: Sixteen T-Mat reception centres.  
RADNOR: How many deaths?  
ELDRED: Brent here, that man in Berlin, two in New York. But I doubt if those
things were sent just to kill one or two people at random.  
RADNOR: What else then?  
ELDRED: Well, I don't know, but  
RADNOR: What?  
ELDRED: I'm wondering if there's any pattern with these cities. London,
Ottawa, Oslo, Hamburg, Berlin.  
RADNOR: Yes, they're all major population centres, certainly.  
ELDRED: But is that all they have in common?  
(A printout arrives at the control panel.)  
ELDRED: What is it?  
RADNOR: The autopsy report on Brent.  
ELDRED: Well?  
RADNOR: He died of oxygen starvation.  
ELDRED: Oxygen starvation takes at least three or four minutes. He died
instantly.  
RADNOR: Exactly. And according to this the medical unit can't believe it
either.  
ELDRED: Obviously what killed him was that smoke-like substance which was
emitted when the pods exploded, which was expelled into the outside
atmosphere. Let's hope that diluted with air it loses it's toxic quality,
otherwise  
(The pod's particles drift like mist in the wind, but where they touch the
ground they quickly 'foam' up into bubbles which then burst and release more
particles.)

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

SLAAR: Zurich. Dispatch!  
FEWSHAM: Is that the last?  
SLAAR: It may be necessary to send further seeds later.  
FEWSHAM: What about him?  
SLAAR: Is he still alive?  
(The Doctor is still out cold face down on the floor. Patrick Troughton is on
holiday this week.)  
FEWSHAM: Yes, he's still breathing.  
SLAAR: That is unusual. Most humans would be dead. Take him to the T-Mat
cubicle.  
FEWSHAM: What for?  
SLAAR: Do as I say.

**[Maintenance tunnel]**

JAMIE: What are they going to do?  
PHIPPS: Shush!

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

SLAAR: Dispose of him.  
FEWSHAM: What do you mean?  
SLAAR: You will adjust the T-Mat controls and suspend him in space between the
moon and Earth.

**[Maintenance tunnel]**

JAMIE: We've got to try and save him.  
PHIPPS: Back of the cubicle. Over here, quick.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

FEWSHAM: But you can't just ask me to kill a man just like that.  
SLAAR: You dispatched the seeds. In so doing you destroyed your entire
species.  
FEWSHAM: Oh, no!  
SLAAR: What is the death of one man compared to that?  
FEWSHAM: What was in those things?  
SLAAR: No more questions. Operate the controls.  
FEWSHAM: I can't. I can't!  
SLAAR: Prefer to die.  
FEWSHAM: T-Mat is only programmed to send to other centres. I shall have to
reprogramme the circuit.  
SLAAR: Then do so at once.

**[Maintenance tunnel]**

JAMIE: Are you sure this is the back of the right cubicle?  
PHIPPS: It'd better be.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

SLAAR: Well?  
FEWSHAM: Please. Please don't make me.  
SLAAR: Complete it!

**[Maintenance tunnel]**

(Phipps and Jamie remove a grill.)  
PHIPPS: Right.  
JAMIE: Oh no!  
(There is a second grill.)  
PHIPPS: Oh, it's only the interior casing. It comes away easily.  
JAMIE: Oh.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

SLAAR: Is the circuit prepared yet?  
FEWSHAM: Yes, almost. Almost.  
SLAAR: You are wasting time. Operate.  
FEWSHAM: No!  
SLAAR: At once!  
(Fewsham reaches for a switch. The T-Mat cubicle is empty.)  
FEWSHAM: You've killed him. You've killed him! You've killed him!  
SLAAR: Prepare to dispatch to London. Do as I say!  
(Slaar goes over to a Warrior.)  
SLAAR: The time has come for your mission. You understand what you must do?  
WARRIOR: I understand.  
SLAAR: You must succeed at all costs.  
(The Warrior goes into a cubicle.)  
SLAAR: Transmit to London.  
FEWSHAM: I need time. I must reprogramme.

**[Maintenance tunnel]**

PHIPPS: Can you manage the Doctor by yourself?  
JAMIE: Yes.  
PHIPPS: Can you remember the way back?  
JAMIE: Oh, I think so.  
PHIPPS: I'll try and get to the heating controls.  
JAMIE: Good.  
(Phipps makes his way up an access ladder and around the back of the control
room. From another grill he can see the heating controls on the wall opposite,
looking like a ship's wheel. He tries to get through an access plate but his
shoulders are too wide.)

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

(Back on Earth, the spores are spreading and reproducing rapidly, covering the
ground with a mass of foam.)  
COMPUTER: Reports now received on cause of death of T-Mat reception
technicians in New York and Berlin. In all cases victims died of oxygen
starvation.  
RADNOR: Discontinue report.  
ELDRED: Wait a minute. There's something else.  
RADNOR: All right. Continue report.  
COMPUTER: Information coming in on appearance of vegetable blight now
attacking parks and gardens in the metropolises. Many areas  
(The Warrior bursts out of the T-Mat cubicle. Technicians flee as it moves
towards them.)  
COMPUTER: Unidentified menace. Foam appears to be byproduct of large fungi
which grow and burst, spreading their spores over large areas. Rate of growth
of fungi such that acres of ground are covered minutes. Estimated that strong
south westerly winds could spread this disease over large areas of Europe and
Asia.  
RADNOR: Guards!  
COMPUTER: Destroying second crop cereals.  
(A guard rushes in, firing. The Warrior uses its own weapon on him then walks
out into the corridor where there is more gunfire. Radnor picks up the dead
guard's gun and goes into the corridor. The Warrior's weapon can be heard.
Radnor returns.)  
RADNOR: The guards. It's killed them. It's killed them all!

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

SLAAR: I shall return shortly. You will remain here. (to another Warrior) The
humans that escaped, have they been found?  
WARRIOR: We are searching for them.  
SLAAR: Intensify the search. They must be found and destroyed. Guard him.

**[Solar Energy Store Room]**

(The Doctor is lying on a table, his face turned away from us.)  
ZOE: How is he?  
KELLY: I think the water helped him.  
JAMIE: Aye, well, we'd better get back there. We've still got to get those
heating control things.  
PHIPPS: It's no good, Jamie, we'll never make it.  
JAMIE: Why not?  
PHIPPS: Because the ventilator's too small and there's no other way.  
JAMIE: Well, maybe I could get through.  
PHIPPS: Look, it's impossible.  
ZOE: How big is this grill?  
PHIPPS: About so big.  
(Zoe steps between his hands.)  
ZOE: Well I could get through.  
JAMIE: No, Zoe. You're not going.  
ZOE: Look, I'm smaller than you and I'll probably be a lot quieter too.  
JAMIE: Look, it's too dangerous anyway.  
ZOE: Well, what other alternative is there?  
JAMIE: Well.  
KELLY: She's right. It's the logical thing to do.  
ZOE: Thank you. Well come on, show me the way.

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

(The Warrior walks through the exploding pods outside.)  
ELDRED: He can't just have vanished.  
RADNOR: I can assure you that the security guards have lost all trace of it.  
ELDRED: I wonder what its purpose was?  
RADNOR: Purpose? What are you talking about?  
ELDRED: Well, can't you see it's all part of the same plan. First the seed
pods and now this creature. I tell you it came here for some purpose, and
heaven help anyone who gets in its way.  
(Some defence technicians are spraying the foam, trying to kill it. They get
covered in it but are wearing breathing apparatus. The Warrior advances. It
kills one and the others flee.)  
ELDRED: Any trace yet of the alien creature?  
COMPUTER: Reports from security negative.  
RADNOR: There you are, what did I tell you.  
COMPUTER: Security reports cordon round T-Mat complex unbroken.  
ELDRED: At least we know it's still in the area.  
COMPUTER: Correction. Urgent message. Bodies of three technicians found in
T-Mat grounds.

**[Maintenance tunnel]**

ZOE: Which way now?  
PHIPPS: I'm not sure.  
ZOE: But you must remember. You've already been this way once with Jamie.  
PHIPPS: Yes, I know, but I can't remember this time.  
ZOE: But surely  
PHIPPS: Look, I can't remember! All the tunnels look the same.  
ZOE: Are you all right?  
PHIPPS: Oh yes, I'm fine. I've seen most of my friends killed. I'm being
hunted by monsters.  
ZOE: If you go on shouting like that, you'll be caught by them and so will I.  
PHIPPS: I'm sorry. I don't know what's the matter with me.  
ZOE: It's nervous exhaustion and a slight touch of claustrophobia. Just sit
down and we'll have a rest.

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

ELDRED: I tell you that creature came here for some purpose. It must be making
for somewhere. Somewhere in this area.  
COMPUTER: Urgent message. Contact made with security guard observing the
alien.  
RADNOR: Relay report direct.  
GUARD [OC]: Report to Central control.

**[T Mat Earth Control grounds]**

GUARD: Report to Central control. The creature is entering the east compound
area.  
(The Warrior sees the guard who making the report. He starts to run, but is
too late.)  
RADNOR [OC]: What's happened? Report.

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

RADNOR: What's happened? Report!  
COMPUTER: Security guard's ceased transmission.  
RADNOR: Tell Security I want a armed patrol sent to the east command area
without fail. Immediately. And relay any findings to me here direct. Top
priority.  
ELDRED: You're only going to lose more security guards.  
RADNOR: Well, I can't let that creature roam loose, can I?  
ELDRED: Can we stop it? Do you know how we can stop it? You know that bullets
will do no good. We've seen that for ourselves. In all these cities that. Wait
a moment. Yes! Oslo, Ottawa, Berlin, Hamburg, London, Paris, New York! These
are the places where the pods have arrived.  
RADNOR: Well, so what?  
ELDRED: Well, don't you see? They're all cold climates. All northern
hemisphere. In all of those cities it's winter, as it is here.  
RADNOR: So?  
ELDRED: Why haven't the pods arrived in any warm areas?  
COMPUTER: Urgent message. Subject, continued breakdown of T-Mat and cessation
of all world transport and distribution. Total breakdown of social order
predicted. Emergency measures proving inadequate.  
RADNOR: Discontinue report.  
COMPUTER: Incoming data will be recorded.  
ELDRED: Well, the emergency measures may still save a few people.  
RADNOR: Well, what's the good of that? With the dislocation of food supplies,
we could lose millions.  
ELDRED: We may lose most of the world's population before they've finished
with us.  
RADNOR: They?  
ELDRED: This creature. It's only the first. We're going to be invaded!

**[Solar Energy Store Room]**

KELLY: Any sign of them?  
JAMIE: No.  
KELLY: They've been gone ages. They can't have reached the heating controls
yet. The temperature seems the same.  
JAMIE: Look, I'm going down there.  
KELLY: No, our job is to act as a rearguard in case something goes wrong.  
JAMIE: Look, a lot of good we are.  
KELLY: Well, we're not entirely helpless.  
JAMIE: You've got that thing working again?  
KELLY: I think so, but we can hardly test it.  
JAMIE: Oh look, where are they? What's keeping them?

**[Maintenance tunnel]**

ZOE: I think we ought to go on.  
PHIPPS: All right.  
ZOE: Look, can you remember the way now?  
PHIPPS: No, it's no good.  
ZOE: We could work it out.  
PHIPPS: How?  
ZOE: Well, presumably these maintenance tunnels run parallel to the corridors.  
PHIPPS: Well, yes they do, but.  
ZOE: Well, I've seen a map of the corridors. The Doctor had one in the rocket.  
PHIPPS: But you can't possibly remember  
ZOE: Yes I can, I think. Now there's a main corridor here, the two junctions
here. We went left, right, left. It must be that one.  
PHIPPS: But you and Jamie got lost on the way to the solar energy storeroom.  
ZOE: Well, only temporarily, I found the way eventually.  
PHIPPS: Well, you'd better be right this time.  
ZOE: Oh come on!  
(A little later, Zoe and Phipps are looking into the Control room.)  
ZOE: Oh, how long is it going to stand there?  
PHIPPS: I don't know. But I daren't move the grille until it goes.

**[Solar Energy Store Room]**

JAMIE: Look, I'd better see what's happened to them.  
KELLY: All right, but  
JAMIE: What?  
KELLY: Shush. Quick, the door!  
JAMIE: Too late!  
(As Warrior enters.)  
JAMIE: (silent) Now!  
(Kelly turns on the solar power line but nothing happens.)  
JAMIE: (silent) Come on.  
(The Warrior turns to leave then returns.)  
JAMIE: (silent) Keep back.  
(The Warrior goes over to the Doctor, still lying on the table.)

**[Maintenance tunnel]**

PHIPPS: He's moving.  
ZOE: Quick, move the grille!

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

FEWSHAM: How much longer must I wait here?  
WARRIOR: Do not ask questions!  
FEWSHAM: I need food, rest. I haven't had any sleep for hours.  
(Fewsham spots Zoe and Phipps peering out of the grille.)  
WARRIOR: What are you doing?  
FEWSHAM: I must fix the cubicle.  
WARRIOR: But you said T-Mat was functioning properly.  
FEWSHAM: I know, but there's something I've forgotten.  
(The Warrior follows Fewsham, with its back to the grille.)

**[Maintenance tunnel]**

PHIPPS: Quick! Now the heating controls are over there. Turn the main wheel to
full.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(Zoe sneaks around the wall, in front of a brightly lit screen, to the heating
wheel. But it is stiff, she can't move it at first. Finally she moves it 180
degrees right and starts to creep back as the temperature climbs rapidly. The
Warrior spots her.)  
PHIPPS: Look out, Zoe!  
(The Warrior kills Phipps. Zoe stands in front of the bright panel.)  
ZOE: Well, help me, can't you? Help me!  
(The Warrior walks towards Zoe.)

__**Episode Five**__

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(Fewsham finally acts, and tries to deflect the Warrior's aim away from Zoe.
It knocks him away as Zoe stands frozen in fear. The temperature is climbing
up to forty degrees C, and the Warrior suddenly puts its claws to its head and
collapses. Zoe runs over to Fewsham.)  
ZOE: Are you all right?  
FEWSHAM: Yes, I am. Who are you? What are you doing here?  
ZOE: Oh, never mind that. I thought you were on their side.  
FEWSHAM: Is that what they all think?  
ZOE: Well, you have been helping them, haven't you.  
FEWSHAM: I had no alternative. They'd have killed me.  
ZOE: Well look, where are the other Ice Warriors?  
FEWSHAM: I think they've gone to their ship, but they'll be coming back. We
must get out of here.  
ZOE: Oh but how?  
FEWSHAM: Look, I can get you back to Earth. T-Mat is working again.  
ZOE: Oh! Well, I'll get back to the others and tell them the good news.

**[Solar Energy Store Room]**

(The Warrior is about to leave when the Doctor starts groaning.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, Victoria, Jamie.  
(The Warrior walks past Jamie's hiding place and he smashes down on its weapon
with a metal bar. It throws him across the room so Kelly has a go too. She is
easily thrown off and it grabs Jamie's wrists.)  
JAMIE: No!  
(The thermometer passes fifty degrees C and the Warrior collapses.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Jamie.  
KELLY: Are you all right?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. Oh, I'm a bit dizzy. It's so hot in here.  
JAMIE: Aye, lucky for us. Zoe and Phipps turned the heating up just in time.  
DOCTOR: What? Well, where are they now?  
KELLY: They went though the maintenance tunnel to the main control room.  
(Zoe enters through the hatch.)  
DOCTOR: Ah, Zoe!  
ZOE: Oh Doctor! (they hug) Oh, are you all right?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so.  
ZOE: Good.  
JAMIE: Where's Phipps?  
ZOE: He's dead. An Ice Warrior killed him.  
KELLY: How did you manage to escape?  
ZOE: That other man helped me.  
KELLY: Fewsham?  
ZOE: Yes.  
KELLY: Well I thought that he was working for them.  
ZOE: He saved my life.  
KELLY: Doesn't sound much like Fewsham.  
ZOE: He attacked a Warrior. He's also got T-Mat working again.  
DOCTOR: Well, do I gather we can get back to Earth then?  
ZOE: Yes, I think so.  
KELLY: Well, let's not waste any more time.  
ZOE: No. Come on.

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

RADNOR: Well, that's all we need.  
ELDRED: What is it?  
RADNOR: Gregson's here.  
ELDRED: Gregson, eh?  
RADNOR: Sir James Gregson.  
ELDRED: United Nations Plenipotentiary.  
RADNOR: Minister with special responsibility for T-Mat.  
ELDRED: And your boss, in other words!  
RADNOR: Oh, don't.  
(An older man enters and hands his briefcase to Radnor.)  
GREGSON: Radnor, I've read your report. I can't make head nor tail of it.
Who's this?  
RADNOR: Professor Eldred, sir.  
ELDRED: How do you do.  
GREGSON: Oh well.  
RADNOR: He's helping me, sir.  
GREGSON: This breakdown of T-Mat. What is the position now?  
RADNOR: Still no contact yet with Moonbase, sir.  
GREGSON: And what are you doing about it?  
RADNOR: We've got people up there.  
GREGSON: How'd you get them there without T-Mat?  
RADNOR: We sent a rocket, sir. Professor Eldred is an expert in rocketry.  
GREGSON: Oh, I see. And what happened to the rocket?  
RADNOR: It's rather difficult to say, sir. We lost radio contact with it soon
after take-off.  
GREGSON: Is that all you've done?  
RADNOR: Oh no. No, my Chief Technician, Miss Kelly, has also gone to Moonbase.  
GREGSON: Oh, more rockets.  
RADNOR: No, sir, she went by T-Mat.  
GREGSON: But T-Mat isn't working.  
RADNOR: Well, T-Mat started to function again, sir, so Miss Kelly went to the
Moonbase with a repair team.  
GREGSON: So you've had a full report from her?  
RADNOR: Well, no, sir. Soon after take off T-Mat ceased to function again.  
GREGSON: But this is quite ridiculous. T-Mat out of action and then this
sudden outbreak of some sort of crop blight.  
RADNOR: Ah, now, you see, sir, we think that's connected  
GREGSON: As for this incredible story about a monster from outer-space  
RADNOR: Well you see, Sir James, I think I owe you an explanation.  
GREGSON: What happened about this creature? Have you any more news?  
ELDRED: No, it seems to have completely disappeared. It was reported here,
then it was seen by some workmen in a building here, and the last sighting was
by the Weather Control Bureau there.  
(The Warrior walks through the foam to the Weather Control building and forces
its way inside. The duty weatherman tries to run but is killed. It then goes
to a convenient Weather Control Unit and moves all the levers to 'Dry', then
uses its weapon on it, fusing the controls in place.)

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

FEWSHAM: But I had to help them or they would have killed me!  
KELLY: All right, Fewsham. There'll be a full inquiry when we get back to
Earth. Tell them. We've no more time to waste here. We must T-Mat back to
Earth immediately.  
DOCTOR: But if we're all going, who is going to dispatch us?  
FEWSHAM: Look, there's a way of doing that. Here. This is a time switch. It
delays transportation by ten seconds.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. How ingenious.  
FEWSHAM: Now I'll dispatch you, and follow using the time switch.  
DOCTOR: Righto. Jamie, Zoe, come along. I think this could be quite fun, you
know.  
JAMIE: Oh.  
(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe get into a cubicle.)  
KELLY: Fewsham, that time switch was down on the maintenance report as being
inoperable.  
FEWSHAM: We repaired it.  
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie vanish.)  
FEWSHAM: In you get, Miss Kelly. Look, I'll use the time switch. You'd better
hurry or those Ice Warriors could be back any minute.

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

DOCTOR: You know, I find T-Mat travel rather disappointing. There's no
sensation at all.  
RADNOR: Where have you been?  
DOCTOR: Ah.  
RADNOR: And what have you been up to all this time?  
DOCTOR: Well  
RADNOR: And where's Miss Kelly.  
(Kelly appears in the T-Mat cubicle.)  
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! Miss Kelly, what's happening up there?  
GREGSON: Will somebody kindly tell me what's happening down here? Who are
these people? Is T-Mat working again?  
DOCTOR: Please! Let us answer one question at a time.  
ELDRED: Doctor, do you know there's been a alien here?  
JAMIE: An Ice Warrior, here?  
DOCTOR: Jamie, I am not surprised. They have taken over the whole of the
Moonbase.  
RADNOR: What about the crew?  
KELLY: All dead except Fewsham.  
RADNOR: You left him there?  
KELLY: Well he said he'd follow using the time switch.  
DOCTOR: He should be back.  
(Kelly goes to the control panel.)  
RADNOR: What's happening?  
KELLY: I thought so. The time switch is out of order.  
DOCTOR: What? But he said he was going to repair it.  
KELLY: He was lying.  
RADNOR: But why?  
KELLY: Well, he's obviously working for them.  
DOCTOR: Then why did he let us escape?

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(Fewsham is waiting. As soon as he hears Slaar's breathing he pretends to be
unconscious across the control desk. Slaar staggers in and goes over to the
temperature control. Fewsham follows him. Slaar turns the temperature down to
cold.)  
SLAAR: What has happened here?  
FEWSHAM: The others, they got in through the grille and turned up the heating.  
SLAAR: Where are they now?  
FEWSHAM: They went back to Earth by T-Mat.  
SLAAR: Why did you not go with them?  
FEWSHAM: I refused. That's why they attacked me.  
SLAAR: Refused? Why?  
FEWSHAM: What do you think would have happened to me back on Earth? I'd have
been executed as a traitor.  
SLAAR: So you hope to live longer by staying here. You value your life. That
is good. You will live if you help us when the invasion fleet arrives.  
FEWSHAM: You're going to land on Earth?  
SLAAR: No, our warriors will land here, on the moon. When the seed pods have
done their work on Earth it will be time to commence the second stage of our
plan.

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

DOCTOR: But don't you see gentlemen? The invasion of Moonbase, the taking over
of T-Mat, the seed pods, the arrival of the Ice Warrior. They're all part of
the same plan.  
RADNOR: Plan? What plan?  
GREGSON: These incidents are so unrelated. This fungus everywhere, what's that
got to do with it?  
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure yet. Have your people been able to make anything of
it?  
RADNOR: Well it's indestructible. We've attacked it in every possible way, but
without success.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but have you tried to understand it?  
GREGSON: Are you suggesting we should psychoanalyse it, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I'm only suggesting that instead of trying to destroy it, you find out
it's composition and purpose.  
ELDRED: Well, there's laboratory equipment in my workshop. You could use that.  
DOCTOR: Good. Then we must find a sample.  
RADNOR: Well, no problem about that. The gardens are full of the stuff.  
DOCTOR: Fine. Then there's no time to be lost.  
ELDRED: I'll get some equipment for you.  
RADNOR: Er, Doctor, do be careful. Those pod things are deadly.  
DOCTOR: Don't worry. I've already had experience. I'll be careful.

**[T Mat Earth Rest area]**

(Zoe and Jamie are sipping drinks while Kelly writes on a clip board.)  
ZOE: But why did Fewsham stay on the moon?  
KELLY: Pretty obvious. He was too afraid to come back here and face an
inquiry.  
ZOE: But he wasn't afraid to stay up there with the Ice Warriors. Well, given
the choice I know which I'd rather face.  
JAMIE: Aye.  
KELLY: There's no time to worry about Fewsham. We must find a way of getting
T-Mat working.  
ZOE: But I thought it was working again now.  
KELLY: It is working. It's still controlled from the moon. We must find a way
of controlling it from the Earth.  
ZOE: But is that possible? Don't you need the moon as a relay?  
KELLY: There might be a way. I must talk to Commander Radnor about it.  
(Kelly leaves.)  
JAMIE: Zoe, look, do you think the Doctor knows what he's doing messing about
with that foam stuff?  
ZOE: Oh, don't worry, Jamie. He'll be all right.  
JAMIE: Oh, yes.  
(Outside, the Doctor gets a sample of fungus on a spatula and puts it in a
large glass container, oblivious to the bubble growing nearby. It bursts, and
he leaps up in alarm. Covering his mouth with a large kerchief, he quickly
scoops up foam with the container and runs.)

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

RADNOR: You really think it would work?  
KELLY: Well, it couldn't be as effective as the Moonbase, of course, which
handles up to two million microwave channels simultaneously. The satellite
would take just a few thousand.  
GREGSON: But that'd be enough for vital food supplies.  
RADNOR: But surely we can't use the normal communications satellites. They're
not programmed for T-Mat.  
KELLY: No, we'd have to send up a specially programmed one.  
ZOE: But that would mean using a rocket, wouldn't it? I thought no one used
them nowadays.  
KELLY: Not manned rockets, but we do send up satellites for communications.  
RADNOR: How soon can you get one up?  
KELLY: Well I don't know. If it were given top priority.

**[Eldred's laboratory]**

(Under a microscope cells divide rapidly.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, it's organic. It's alive. Definitely a fungus composition.  
(The Doctor picks up a molecular model.)  
DOCTOR: You're sure that this is correct?  
ELDRED: As far as I can make out, it is.  
DOCTOR: A molecule of five atoms absorbs oxygen. You know, a complete blanket
of this would reduce the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere quite
drastically.  
ELDRED: According to my calculations, to one twentieth of normal.  
DOCTOR: It would make the atmosphere of the Earth uninhabitable to the human
race, but exactly like the atmosphere of Mars.  
(A beaker is foaming out onto the bench.)  
DOCTOR: Look at that. Even without vegetation to feed on, it's still active.  
(A bubble grows.)  
DOCTOR: Oh!  
ELDRED: Look out, Doctor. If that thing explodes in here, the fumes will kill
us. Come on, Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Just a minute, there must be some way of  
(The Doctor puts his kerchief over his mouth and starts pouring liquids onto
the bubble.)  
ELDRED: Come on, before its too late!  
DOCTOR: Sulphuric acid. Hydrochloric acid. Acetic acid.  
ELDRED: Come on, Doctor!  
(The Doctor tips the contents of a large measuring glass over the bubble, and
it starts to shrink.)  
ELDRED: You've done it! Well, what was it? What did you throw on it?

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

COMPUTER: Extensive search by security forces reveals no trace of alien
creature. Message ends.  
JAMIE: So that warrior's still roaming around loose somewhere.  
ZOE: But why did they only send one of them?  
ZOE: Well, perhaps he's got to report back somehow.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Is Commander Radnor there, please? Ah, Zoe! Is Radnor
there?  
ZOE: No, he's in conference with Miss Kelly and Sir James Gregson.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Zoe, it's the most wonderful news. We've found a way of
destroying the fungus.  
ZOE: Well, what is it?  
DOCTOR: Water. Ordinary water!  
JAMIE: Eh?  
ZOE: Oh, but Doctor, surely ordinary  
DOCTOR: There's no time to explain now. Apparently there is a Weather Control
Bureau somewhere. I want you to get in touch with them.  
ZOE: Well, can't you reach them on the video-phone?  
DOCTOR: Well, no. No, I've tried, but they're not answering or it's broken
down or something.  
ZOE: What do you want me to do?  
DOCTOR: Well, get in touch with Commander Radnor and ask him to get hold of
the Weather Control Bureau people and to make rain. As much rain as possible
over the entire country.  
ZOE: All right, Doctor. I'll tell him.  
DOCTOR: Right. The Professor and I are coming back now.  
ZOE: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Bye.  
(Transmission ends.)  
ZOE: But Doctor, suppose that? Oh!  
JAMIE: Hey, how do we get hold of Commander Radnor?  
ZOE: We'll ask the computer.  
JAMIE: Do you know how it works?  
ZOE: Yes, of course. Put me in touch with Commander Radnor at once.  
COMPUTER: Commander Radnor engaged in top level T-Mat conference with Chief
Technician Kelly and Sir James Gregson.  
ZOE: But this is urgent. I must talk to him at once!  
COMPUTER: Commander Radnor not available.  
JAMIE: Oh, now what do we do?  
ZOE: We just have to go to the Weather Bureau ourselves.  
JAMIE: We don't know where it is.  
ZOE: Well, we'll have to try and find it. Come on.  
JAMIE: Oh, Zoe.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(Two Warriors wheel in a fancy device with a small monitor set into it.)  
SLAAR: There.  
FEWSHAM: What is it?  
SLAAR: Communications unit from our ship. Connect it to the solar batteries.  
FEWSHAM: What's this section for?  
SLAAR: That does not concern you.  
FEWSHAM: I can't connect equipment if I don't know its purpose.  
SLAAR: It transmits a directional beam signal.  
FEWSHAM: A homing device. You'll use it to guide your armada onto the moon?  
SLAAR: You will not ask questions. You will do as you are told!

**[Weather Control Bureau]**

(Jamie and Zoe pick their way around the side of the building avoiding the
foam which is creeping ever nearer to the open main door, and go inside.)  
JAMIE: Hadn't we better close the door?  
ZOE: Why?  
JAMIE: In case that warrior's still prowling around out there.  
(They push the door closed and the foam piles up against it outside. Jamie
turns a knob to lock it.)  
JAMIE: That should keep him out. Come on.  
(They go down some steps.)  
JAMIE: Well, where is everybody?  
ZOE: I don't know. Well, let's try and find the main control room. Come on.

**[Weather Control Room]**

(The weatherman's body is still there.)  
ZOE: So that's why nobody answered the video-phone.  
JAMIE: Hey, and look at that!  
(Jamie tries to move the fused control unit levers.)  
JAMIE: No, it's no good. They're locked in position.  
ZOE: Well, don't you see? It's what the Doctor said. Water. Rain. Well, it all
makes sense now. They don't want it to rain on the fungus.  
JAMIE: Well, shush! It's a warrior. Hide!  
(The Warrior's heavy breathing has preceded it again, and Jamie and Zoe are
hidden by the time it enters.)

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(Slaar is talking to his superior on their own monitor. The Grand Marshall has
sequins on his helmet.)  
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Are all the preparations complete?  
SLAAR: Yes, Grand Marshall. The seed pods have been dispatched to the cities
of the Earth, and the Moonbase is in our hands.  
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Good. Our fleet is approaching the gravitational field
of the moon. Is all prepared?  
SLAAR: Everything is ready. I shall guide our ships in on the homing beam
signal.  
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Fuel supplies are at marginal level. There must be no
misjudgments.  
(Fewsham quietly switches on the video-link.)

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

(A rocket stands at a gantry.)  
COMPUTER: Final checkout routines under way.  
KELLY: I hope they know what they're doing. It's been years since we sent up a
satellite.  
RADNOR: Are you quite sure the communications aspects will function?  
KELLY: Yes. Once that satellite's up, T-Mat will be able to handle two
thousand microwave channels.  
(Eldred and the Doctor enter.)  
ELDRED: What's going on? Someone sending up a rocket?  
RADNOR: Look, look! What the devil's happening?  
(The video-link shows the scene on the Moon.)  
KELLY: I don't know. It's, yes, Moon Control.  
DOCTOR: The sound, can you turn it up?  
FEWSHAM [on monitor]: Shouldn't we test the directional beam?

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

SLAAR: It is not necessary.  
FEWSHAM: But it's operating on Moonbase power. I can't guarantee the pulsing
rate will be the same.  
SLAAR: Very well. Test it.

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

DOCTOR: Commander Radnor, can this be recorded?  
RADNOR: Well, yes.  
DOCTOR: Well quickly, man. It's vital!  
RADNOR: The transmission coming in on the video machine is to be recorded.  
COMPUTER: Instructions understood. Transmission will be recorded.  
SLAAR [on monitor]: The device is operating.  
FEWSHAM [on monitor]: Wait a moment.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

FEWSHAM: I must check the connections.  
SLAAR: Why?  
FEWSHAM: If the power fails we won't be able to guide the fleet onto the moon.  
SLAAR: There must be no failures.  
FEWSHAM: I realise the importance of that. If we overshoot the moon, nothing
will stop them from going straight into an orbit around the sun.  
SLAAR: They will not overshoot!  
FEWSHAM: Of course not. But since their fuel supplies are at a marginal level,
if anything did go wrong, they'd never be able to regain moon orbit.  
SLAAR: This video device is operating. You have betrayed us!  
FEWSHAM: Every word has bee heard on Earth!  
SLAAR: Kill him!  
(A warrior obeys. Earth Control sees Fewsham die, then Slaar has the video
camera destroyed too.)

**[T Mat Earth Control]**

COMPUTER: Countdown about to commence. Minus three minutes.  
DOCTOR: Cancel the launch!  
KELLY: Why? What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: We can use that satellite to mislead the Martian invasion fleet.  
RADNOR: What?  
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? Poor Fewsham deliberately let us overhear their
homing signal. We can imitate that signal with a homing device of our own in
the satellite!  
RADNOR: Commander Radnor. Top priority message to satellite launching site.
Cancel launch. Repeat, cancel launch!  
COMPUTER: Message understood.  
DOCTOR: If we can deflect their armada, half our battle is won.  
RADNOR: But there's still all that fungus stuff everywhere.  
ELDRED: We've solved that one. Plain ordinary H20. Water!  
RADNOR: Water?! Well, all we need to do then is to make it rain.  
DOCTOR: Well, haven't you already done that? Haven't you been in touch with
the Weather Control Bureau?  
RADNOR: You've only just told me.  
DOCTOR: But I sent you a message over an hour ago. Didn't Zoe reach you?  
RADNOR: No.  
KELLY: An hour ago we were in conference.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Well, perhaps Zoe went to the Weather Control people
herself?  
ELDRED: Doctor, the Weather Control Bureau was the last place the warrior was
sighted!  
DOCTOR: What?  
RADNOR: I'll have a squad of security guards over there right away. Hadn't you
better wait, Doctor?  
(The Doctor has left.)  
RADNOR: Get me Security!

**[Outside the Weather Control Bureau]**

(Kerchief over his mouth, the Doctor picks his way carefully to the door,
which no longer has foam up against it until he gets there, then it is up to
his shoulders. Bubbles grow and burst as he hammers on the door.)  
DOCTOR: Zoe! Are you in there? Zoe!

**[Weather Control Room]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Zoe! Jamie! Let me in!  
(The Warrior turns back from Zoe and Jamie's hiding place to investigate the
noise.)

**[Outside the Weather Control Bureau]**

DOCTOR: Zoe! Jamie! Zoe!  
(The Doctor moves out of the doorway to see a tidal wave of foam and bubbles
bearing down.)  
DOCTOR: Oh no!  
(The Doctor slips and disappears under the foam, then gets up to hammer again
on the door.)  
DOCTOR: Zoe!

**[Weather Control Room]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Let me in! Zoe! Jamie!

**[Outside the Weather Control Bureau]**

DOCTOR: Zoe! Jamie! If you're there, let me in! Oh, no!  
( A huge bubble forms next to him. The Doctor covers his face with the
kerchief and presses into the corner of the doorway.)

__**Episode Six**__

**[Outside the Weather Control Bureau]**

DOCTOR: Are you in there, Jamie!  
(With the Warrior heading for the entrance, Jamie and Zoe run from their
hiding places.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie, open the door!

**[Weather Control Bureau]**

(Jamie and Zoe catch up with the Warrior near the Solar Energy Room. Jamie
mouths instructions at Zoe. Sorry, I don't lip read. Zoe hides and Jamie
circles round then leaps out in front of the Warrior.)  
JAMIE: Hey!  
(Jamie runs off. The Warrior fires its weapon but he's already gone. Zoe comes
out of hiding and runs down another corridor.)

**[Outside the Weather Control Bureau]**

DOCTOR: Zoe! Jamie! If you're there, let me in!  
(A bubble forms next to him. Again.)  
DOCTOR: Oh no!

**[Weather Control Bureau]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Jamie, Zoe, open this door!  
(Zoe gets to the main door and starts to unlock it.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Jamie? Zoe?

**[Weather Control Bureau]**

(Finally Zoe heaves the door open, and a flood of foam pours in with the
Doctor. They get the door closed again.)  
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh my word!  
(Zoe pulls him away from the door.)  
DOCTOR: What? Where are we going?  
(In a dry corridor.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, my word. Oh, that was a dangerous situation!  
ZOE: It still is, Doctor. There's an Ice Warrior in the building.  
DOCTOR: What? What about Jamie?  
ZOE: Well, he drew the warrior off so that I could let you in.  
DOCTOR: Oh. no. We must help him.  
ZOE: Oh no, Doctor, this way.  
DOCTOR: What?  
(Jamie leads the Warrior back into the Control room, but there is nowhere to
hide. It fires its weapon at him and he dodges around bits of equipment before
going through another doorway and shutting it behind him. The Warrior tries to
blast its way out. In a corridor - )  
JAMIE: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Jamie!  
ZOE: Oh Jamie, where's the Ice Warrior?  
JAMIE: Well, I locked him in the room that we were trapped in.  
(They hear the Warrior's weapon firing.)  
DOCTOR: I don't think he's stayed in there, Jamie. Come on!  
(They return to outside the Solar Energy Room.)  
ZOE: Oh look, we could hide in here.  
JAMIE: We'd just be trapped again.  
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, I think this is just the place.  
JAMIE: Why?

**[Solar Energy room]**

DOCTOR: Solar energy room. That means that's a radiation door. Now, if I can
find the control.  
ZOE: Oh Doctor, hurry!  
DOCTOR: It must be here somewhere.  
JAMIE: What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: Ah, wait a minute.  
JAMIE: Is that the one?  
(Jamie throws a switch on the wall and the room goes dark.)  
DOCTOR: No, Jamie! (switches the lights on again) It must be one of these.  
ZOE: Oh hurry, Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Ah! There we are. It's got 'shut' on it.  
(The door closes in the Warrior's face.)  
ZOE: Oh!  
DOCTOR: Get back!  
(The Warrior fires at the door.)  
JAMIE: He's trying to blast his way in!  
DOCTOR: Well, it should hold for a little while, Jamie.  
ZOE: Well, what do we do now?  
DOCTOR: Well, Commander Radnor's sending some security guards.  
JAMIE: A lot of good they'll do against an Ice Warrior.  
ZOE: Solar energy. When we were on the moon, Phipps made a trap.  
DOCTOR: Solar energy. Reflectors, of course! Well, we ought to be able to rig
something up here.  
JAMIE: Aye, well, you'd better be quick about it. That shield thing won't hold
much longer.  
(A security team is making its way to the Bureau, clearing its path with water
sprays. The Warrior has made a scorch mark on the door but that is all.
Security reach the Bureau, open the main door and go inside. The Warrior meets
them in a corridor and kills the lead two men while the others go down another
corridor. The Doctor has been busy with wires, bulbs and two reflectors. Jamie
is getting the last of the foam off the Doctor's jacket.)  
DOCTOR: Is this the sort of thing that Phipps rigged up, Zoe?  
ZOE: Well, sort of. It's not quite the same. His was bigger.  
DOCTOR: I think you'll find that this will be better for  
(They hear gunfire outside.)  
JAMIE: They're still shooting out there. They don't stand a chance, though.  
ZOE: Are you nearly ready, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Open the door.  
(The Doctor holds a reflector in each hand.)  
JAMIE: Are you sure that thing works, now?  
DOCTOR: The only way to find out is to try, Jamie. Now open the door.  
(Jamie opens the door.)  
DOCTOR: It's gone.  
JAMIE: Must be chasing after those guards.  
DOCTOR: Another moment and we could have destroyed him. There's some more HD
cable there.  
JAMIE: Eh?  
DOCTOR: You reel it out and I'll make the connections.  
JAMIE: What, this?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, that's it, Jamie. Hurry up.  
(Security are trying to lure the Warrior out of the Bureau.)  
DOCTOR: Zoe, stand by to throw the switch. Jamie, play out the cable.  
JAMIE: Right.

**[Weather Control Bureau]**

(The Doctor heads off down the corridors with his infra red devices, and
finally encounters the Warrior.)  
DOCTOR: Now, Zoe!  
(Zoe switches on and the Ice Warrior melts.)  
DOCTOR: All right, Zoe!

**[T-Mat Earth Control]**

COMPUTER: No information yet available from Weather Control Bureau.  
RADNOR: Oh, no. I'd better get over there.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: T-Mat control? Commander Radnor? Ah.  
RADNOR: Doctor!  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: This is the Doctor.  
RADNOR: Doctor, are you all right? What's happening over there?  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Yes, well, we've had quite a battle here, but things are
all right now. There was a warrior here, but we've dealt with him.  
RADNOR: Excellent! Is there much damage?  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Well, yes, I'm afraid so. I'm going to see how much now.
How are you getting along with the signal in the satellite?  
RADNOR: Professor Eldred and Miss Kelly are coping with it now.  
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Good. I'll be back as soon as I can.  
(Transmission ends.)  
RADNOR: How's it going?  
KELLY: We're ready to test.  
RADNOR: Play back recording of homing beam.  
(The computer obeys.)  
KELLY: Now, that's the Ice-Warriors' homing beam. Let's see if I can produce
that exactly.  
(But it's too fast and high pitched. She adjusts it with a screwdriver.)  
RADNOR: Oh, can't you get any closer than that?  
KELLY: I shall, don't worry!  
ELDRED: That's it.  
KELLY: I'll lock it to that frequency.  
ELDRED: Just one thing, Miss Kelly. Now that you've perfected this thing, how
do you propose getting it to the launching pad without T-Mat?  
KELLY: It just so happens I found a petrol car in a motor museum.  
ELDRED: Really? What make?  
KELLY: I've no idea, but it's got four wheels and it goes. Get this to the
vehicle immediately.  
(A technician takes the homing beam away.)  
ELDRED: Will a car be able to get through the foam?  
RADNOR: Yes. I've arranged for a route to be cleared by hosing the foam.  
ELDRED: Good, good.  
RADNOR: But the only way we'll ever get rid of it permanently is by rain. Lots
of rain!

**[Weather Control Room]**

JAMIE: It's hopeless, Doctor. You'll never get that thing going again.  
DOCTOR: I'm not so sure, Jamie. After all, it's only the controls that are
damaged. The workings are all right. If we can bypass the controls. Have you
got your knife on you?  
JAMIE: Eh? Aye.  
DOCTOR: Lend it me, will you?  
JAMIE: Be careful with this.  
DOCTOR: That's it, thank you.  
(The Doctor uses the sgian dubh to get inside the workings of the weather
control unit.)  
DOCTOR: There we are. Now, what have we got here? Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes,
well, it's just a question of sorting this lot out, that's all.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

MARSHALL [on monitor]: You should not have killed him. Who will operate T-Mat?  
SLAAR: I have studied the controls.  
MARSHALL [on monitor]: What if the apparatus breaks down?  
SLAAR: I shall send warriors to Earth to bring back technicians.  
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Soon all humans on Earth will be extinct.  
SLAAR: It will take time for the fungus to remove the oxygen from their
atmosphere.  
MARSHALL [on monitor]: You must use that time to obtain another human, and do
not kill him.  
SLAAR: No, Grand Marshall.  
MARSHALL [on monitor]: You will be prepared to activate the homing beam on our
signal?  
SLAAR: All is prepared, Grand Marshall.  
(Transmission ends.)  
SLAAR: I shall return to our ship to finalise invasion plans.

**[Weather Control Room]**

DOCTOR: Right, now then, Zoe, let's see what happens when we try to connect
these two together. (they spark.) No, I don't think so, somehow. What about
these two? (no sparks so he twists the ends together) Ah, that's better. I
think I've succeeded in re-establishing one of these rain circuits, Jamie.  
(Jamie is up on a cat walk looking out of the window.)  
JAMIE: It's not raining yet.  
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie. Weather control is a very difficult technology. You can't
expect immediate results.  
ZOE: Are you sure you're getting it right, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Well, I hope so, Zoe. Just have to hope for the best, that's all. I
must get on because there's another little job that I want to do.  
JAMIE: Have you not got enough to do already?  
ZOE: What else is there?  
DOCTOR: Well, I want to make some alterations to my solar energy device.

**[T-Mat Earth Control]**

MAN [OC]: Lift off in five seconds from now. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
Zero.  
(The rocket lifts off. The Doctor with his infra-red lamps, Zoe and Jamie
enter.)  
DOCTOR: With any luck, we should have some nice heavy rain before long. Ah,
there we are.  
KELLY: Yes, the satellite.  
ELDRED: Isn't that a beautiful sight?  
KELLY: We finished and installed the homing device. It's working perfectly.  
DOCTOR: Well done.  
KELLY: Doctor? DOCTOR: Yes, Miss Kelly?  
KELLY: I know we're sending up a false signal, but aren't some of the Martian
ships bound to follow the right one?  
DOCTOR: There isn't going to be a right one. There's only going to be ours,
the wrong one, and that's going to lead the entire Martian fleet into an orbit
around the sun.  
ZOE: What about Slaar's signal?  
DOCTOR: Oh, obviously that has to be stopped.  
ELDRED: But how?  
DOCTOR: Well, as soon as the satellite is up, I shall T-Mat myself to the moon
and destroy their homing device.  
KELLY: They'll kill you on sight.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. I've rigged up a rather interesting little
device here.  
KELLY: What's it for?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's a development of the solar energy device that you so
successfully used on the moon, only I've succeeded in rendering it portable.
I've got a solar battery.  
(The satellite has been deployed and is transmitting.)  
KELLY: Well, there it is. It's in orbit. We're now picking up the alien's
homing signal from the moon. DOCTOR: Well, that means that their invasion
fleet is getting closer. There's not time to be lost. Now, are you quite
clear? As soon as I have succeeded in destroying their signal you must
activate our signal in the satellite.  
RADNOR: Oh, we'll be ready.  
DOCTOR: Right, then I'll be off.  
ZOE: Oh Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes? What is it, Zoe?  
ZOE: You will be careful, won't you?  
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Zoe, I will. Are you ready, Miss Kelly?  
KELLY: But Doctor, our control of T-Mat hasn't been tested.  
DOCTOR: Then now's the time to test it.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

(It works. The only Warrior there has its back to the T-Mat cubicle. The
Doctor sneaks out of the cubicle, the Warrior turns and the Doctor uses the
solar projectors on it. The Doctor puts down his device and starts fiddling
with the Slaar's communication device. Another Warrior enters with Slaar. The
Doctor surrenders.)  
SLAAR: No.  
(The Warrior lowers its weapon.)  
SLAAR: You, over there. I ordered you to be destroyed!  
DOCTOR: Well, you weren't very successful, were you.  
SLAAR: Destroy that weapon.  
(The warrior fires.)  
SLAAR: What is your purpose in coming here?  
DOCTOR: Well, you don't expect me to tell you that, do you?  
SLAAR: The directional beam is still operative.  
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm afraid you were a little too quick for me.  
SLAAR: Are you capable of operating the T-Mat mechanism?  
DOCTOR: Oh no, I don't think I could  
(Slaar gestures the Warrior to shoot the Doctor.)  
DOCTOR: Well, well yes, perhaps I could get the hang of it.  
SLAAR: As long as you can be useful to us, you can live. But this time there
will be no escape. You will familiarise yourself with the T-Mat controls.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much.  
SLAAR: You will not touch the controls until I give the order.

**[T-Mat Earth Control]**

KELLY: It's operating perfectly.  
RADNOR: Good!  
ELDRED: Shouldn't we have waited until the Doctor got back?  
RADNOR: The moon signal has disappeared, hasn't it?  
ELDRED: It may be purely atmospheric. For all we know they're still
transmitting as strong as ever.  
ZOE: The moon signal was strong enough before the Doctor left. He must have
succeeded.  
JAMIE: Then why hasn't he come back?

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

MARSHALL [on monitor]: We are receiving your homing signal clearly. Soon we
shall enter the gravitational field of the moon.  
SLAAR: All is prepared, Grand Marshall. I have obtained the services of
another human. He will T-Mat our warriors to Earth.  
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Good. I shall resume transmission when landing is
imminent.  
(Transmission ends.)  
SLAAR: When our warriors arrive, you will transmit them to Earth under my
direction.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but they haven't arrived yet, have they. Something still might go
wrong, you know.  
SLAAR: Nothing can go wrong now.  
DOCTOR: There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.  
SLAAR: If anything does go wrong, you will be the first to die.

**[T-Mat Earth Control]**

(The invasion fleet is on radar.)  
RADNOR: Scan closer!  
KELLY: If they are going to divert, if should happen any moment now.  
ZOE: Look, they're changing course.  
RADNOR: I think you're right.  
ELDRED: Yes, they're all following the satellite signal.  
RADNOR: Then the Doctor must have succeeded. He must have turned off the
Martian signal.  
JAMIE: Well, what's happening up there, then? Why hasn't he come back?  
RADNOR: Don't worry, Jamie. A squad of security guards armed with
flamethrowers are on their way here now, and as soon as they get here we'll
T-Mat them to the moon.  
JAMIE: Oh, they'll be too late.  
RADNOR: You'll just have to be patient!  
JAMIE: Och, I'm sick of being patient!  
(Jamie takes Zoe aside and whispers.)  
JAMIE: Zoe. That T-Mat thing. Do you know how it works?  
ZOE: I think so. Why?  
JAMIE: Could you T-Mat me back to the moon?  
ZOE: Oh, now Jamie, surely  
JAMIE: Look, either the Doctor's all right, in which case we've no need to
worry, or he's in danger and he needs my help.

**[T Mat Moonbase Control]**

MARSHALL [on monitor]: Slaar! We are passing between Earth and moon! The
signal has not led us into the moon's gravitational field!  
SLAAR: Have you lost my signal?  
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Your signal is being received clearly, but we are off
course.  
SLAAR: Are you sure your calculations are correct?  
MARSHALL [on monitor]: Our calculations have been checked. You have sent us
into an orbit close to the sun!  
SLAAR: Use your retro-active rockets to change course!  
MARSHALL [on monitor]: It is too late. We have insufficient fuel for
manoeuvre. You have failed us, Slaar! We shall all die! We are being drawn
into the orbit of the sun!  
(Transmission ends.)  
SLAAR: This is impossible!  
(Slaar checks the communications device.)  
SLAAR: The signal. There is no power. You did this.  
DOCTOR: Yes. That signal has been going no further than this control room.  
SLAAR: But they were receiving my signal.  
DOCTOR: Not your signal. Ours.  
SLAAR: You sent a signal from Earth?  
DOCTOR: We sent up a satellite. That signal has sent your fleet into a false
orbit.  
SLAAR: The heat of the sun will kill them! You have destroyed our entire
fleet!  
DOCTOR: You tried to destroy an entire world.  
SLAAR: Earth will still die. The fungus will take the oxygen from your
atmosphere.  
DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid that you've failed there too. We can destroy the
fungus.  
SLAAR: Kill him!  
(A voice calls out from the T-Mat cubicle.)  
JAMIE: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Jamie, look out!  
(The Doctor leaps over the T-Mat control desk and tackles the Warrior. He
diverts its aim so that Slaar dies instead of Jamie. Jamie runs across the
room and leaps on the Warrior.)  
JAMIE: Creag an tuire!  
(The Doctor holds up his solar energy power leads.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie, a live terminal!  
(Jamie and the Doctor each press the leads into the Warrior's body. There is a
bright flash and the Warrior collapses.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Jamie! Oh, goodness me! Jamie, thank you very much. Now
then, we must T-Mat ourselves back to Earth.

**[T-Mat Earth Control]**

(Where a heavy thunderstorm is washing away the foam.)  
COMPUTER: Wide spread rainfall throughout the country. Some flooding but none
serious. Fungus rapidly disappearing. Weather Control Bureau coming back into
operation. World food shortages partially relieved now T-Mat becoming
operational again. Message to Commander Radnor from the Security Council of
the United Nations. Congratulations.  
RADNOR: All right, discontinue report.  
ZOE: So you really did know what you were doing at the Weather Control Bureau.  
DOCTOR: But, Zoe, of course I did!  
JAMIE: Aye, well, it took long enough to work, eh?  
RADNOR: Well, the rain seems to have disposed of the fungus well enough. Now
the next thing to do is to get T-Mat fully operational again.  
KELLY: Yes, when moon relay's repaired we must check over the equipment and
build in safeguards. From now on T-Mat must be entirely controlled from Earth.  
ELDRED: Oh, surely you've learned not to put all of your eggs in one basket in
future?  
KELLY: T-Mat in itself is perfectly effective.  
ELDRED: You need a secondary transportation system. A fleet of rockets on
permanent standby.  
RADNOR: Yes, but Professor Eldred, we  
KELLY: There's no need to go to those lengths.  
ELDRED: It's a question of common sense. I'm sure the Doctor will agree with
me. Doctor.  
(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe are not there.)

**[Space museum]**

JAMIE: Did you have to make it rain as hard as all that?  
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie, sometimes I think you're never satisfied.  
ZOE: What did you rush us back here for?  
DOCTOR: Well, you know, questions, explanations. It's very difficult. Come on.  
(The Doctor enters the Tardis.)  
ZOE: Oh, where are going now?  
JAMIE: Oh, it's no good asking him. He's no more idea than the man in the
moon.  
DOCTOR: I heard that, Jamie. Come on.  
(They all get into the Tardis, and it dematerialises.)
