__**Episode One**__

**[Mountainside]**

(High on a mountainside, sheltered by a rocky outcrop, a camp fire glimmers
fitfully in the night air. A man cries out. Edward Travers, woken by the cry,
sits up quickly.)  
TRAVERS: John?  
(Noticing his companion's empty sleeping bag, Travers takes his rifle and
moves towards the sound.)  
TRAVERS: John, where are you?  
(Another scream. Travers back away in fear then turns and stumbles into the
night. An enormous shadow falls across the campsite and an object is tossed to
the ground - Travers' rifle, twisted beyond recognition.)

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria are gathered in front of the scanner screen.)  
DOCTOR: I don't believe it. Marvellous. After all this time.  
JAMIE: Oh, what's so marvellous about that?  
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see, Jamie? It's the Himalayas. And I do believe we're
in exactly the right. Now, wait a minute.  
JAMIE: The Hima - what?  
DOCTOR: Shush. Shush.  
VICTORIA: The Himalayas, Jamie. They're mountains.  
JAMIE: Aye, I can see that. Hey, is it the Earth, Doctor? I don't fancy
another tangle down the Cybermen's tomb.  
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie, shush. Yes, of course it's the Earth. Yes, yes, I think
I'm right. Yes.  
JAMIE: Where are these mountains?  
VICTORIA: Don't you know where the Himalayas are? They're in India. Well, at
least I think so.  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's it! I knew it, I knew it. It's incredible. Right. Oh no.
No, not India. This is Tibet. That's where we are, Tibet. Now, there's no time
to be lost. Come along, Jamie, we must find the ghanta.  
JAMIE: The what?  
DOCTOR: The ghanta, the ghanta. I put it here somewhere. Come along, Jamie,
help me.  
(The Doctor rummages in a large chest.)  
JAMIE: Hey, what am I supposed to be looking for?  
DOCTOR: I told you it's. Good Lord, I haven't seen that for years.  
JAMIE: Oh, that's the ghanta then?  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. It's a. Well, whatever it is, it's nice to see it
again.  
VICTORIA: Oh.  
(Jamie has found a set of bagpipes.)  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Come along, Victoria.  
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, would you look at these? You never told me you had these.  
DOCTOR: No, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Hey. Oh, I could fix those easily.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I was afraid of that.  
VICTORIA: Jamie, you're getting as bad as the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Come along, help me find the ghanta.  
VICTORIA: It would help us considerably if we knew what we were looking for.  
DOCTOR: Ghanta!  
VICTORIA: But what is it?  
DOCTOR: Oh, what is it? You don't know? Oh, it's a bell.  
VICTORIA: Oh, it's a bell, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Oh, a bell. Oh, well now we know what we're looking for.  
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a Tibetan bell, actually. A holy relic. This one is quite
small. It has a dragon on it. As a matter of fact, it has rather an
interesting history. It was. Oh. Ah ha, yes, I'll have that.  
The Doctor takes out a huge fur coat.)  
DOCTOR: Yes, it's just the thing for this climate. Now, you might as well find
yourselves something while you're about it. How do I look?  
VICTORIA: Doctor, you look beautiful.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought I might. I think I'll go and have a scout around. Now,
you two find the bell. It's very important.  
VICTORIA: Oh, but why do you want it?  
DOCTOR: Because down there it's going to guarantee us the welcome of a
lifetime.  
VICTORIA: Down there?  
(The Doctor goes outside.)  
JAMIE: Oh, don't ask me. When you've been with the Doctor as long as I have,
you begin to realise you don't know what he's talking about. We'd better find
this bell of his.  
VICTORIA: Oh, wait a minute, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Hey, come and give us a hand.  
VICTORIA: I want to see where the Doctor's gone. Now if I turn this to the
left it should. Ah ha that's it.  
(Jamie takes a scimitar from the chest.)  
JAMIE: Hey, now would you look at this. Oh, that's marvellous. What. Hey,
what's that?  
VICTORIA: Where?  
JAMIE: A great sort of hairy beastie. Turn the thing back.  
VICTORIA: Oh.  
JAMIE: No, to the right.  
VICTORIA: I am.  
JAMIE: Downwards. That's it, there.  
(A large fur covered figure looms up on the screen.)  
JAMIE: Oh no, my mistake. The great hairy beastie, it's the Doctor.

**[Mountainside]**

(The Doctor clambers over a crest and gets a spectacular view of some
buildings nestling in the valley below.)  
DOCTOR: Yes. Ah, yes.

**[Tardis]**

(Jamie has found a drawstring bag labelled Ghanta of Detsen Monastery.)  
VICTORIA: A monastery.  
JAMIE: Aye, that'll be where he's gone.  
VICTORIA: I wonder why he wouldn't take us?  
JAMIE: You can never tell with the Doctor. Hey, just thought. Do they let
lasses into monasteries?  
VICTORIA: I don't know. Oh, don't say that.  
JAMIE: Oh, never mind. I suppose he'll manage somehow.  
VICTORIA: Hey, shall we open it?  
JAMIE: I don't think so. The Doctor might not like it.

**[Mountainside]**

(Making his way back to the Tardis, the Doctor notices something on the
ground. He bends down to examine a vast footprint. From some way off, a shaggy
figure is watching from behind a tree. It disappears as the Doctor stands up
again.)

**[Tardis]**

VICTORIA: Apart from climbing boots, I really think you ought to wear
something warm.  
JAMIE: I tell you, I'm a Highlander. The cold doesn't affect me.  
VICTORIA: There's a great deal of difference between the Highlands and the
Himalayas, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Aye, they're bigger.  
(The Doctor enters.)  
VICTORIA: Oh, there you are, Doctor. I found this bell thing you were looking
for.  
DOCTOR: Oh, splendid, splendid.  
VICTORIA: Is the monastery far? Can we come too?  
DOCTOR: Yes. No. One thing at a time, Victoria. We must find this ghanta.  
VICTORIA: Oh, here.  
DOCTOR: Hmm? Ah. Hmm.  
VICTORIA: Is this where we're going, Detsen?  
DOCTOR: Detsen, yes, that's the name of the monastery, but I'm afraid you're
not going. Well, not yet a while anyway.  
VICTORIA: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: No, I think it'd be better if I went alone.  
JAMIE: You've seen something haven't you? Would it not be better I went with
you?  
VICTORIA: Is there something dangerous then, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Oh, good heavens, no. No, there's nothing for you to worry about. Now,
you stay here with Jamie, inside, and I'll be as quick as I can.  
VICTORIA: Oh, er, Doctor?  
(Victoria holds out the bag.)  
DOCTOR: Oh. I nearly forgot it.

**[Mountainside]**

(A trail of large footprints leads across the rocky terrain and into the trees
where the same large hairy figure stands staring down onto the path. The
Doctor approaches. He stops and looks around him, then carries on.)

**[Tardis]**

VICTORIA: Oh, I'm getting bored. Let's go outside.  
JAMIE: No, I don't think we should.  
VICTORIA: All right, I'll go by myself.  
JAMIE: Oh no, you won't. You won't leave me here by myself.  
VICTORIA: Oh come on. We needn't be long.  
JAMIE: Aye, well, just a quick look then.

**[Mountainside]**

(The Doctor finds Travers' deserted campsite.)  
DOCTOR: Anybody here?  
(He finds the mangled rifle, then behind a rock, a dead man.)  
(Outside the Tardis, Victoria is sight-seeing whilst wearing plus-fours and a
tweed jacket.)  
JAMIE: What can you see?  
VICTORIA: Come on, it's a marvellous view.  
JAMIE: Aye, so it is. Now, come away back.  
VICTORIA: Why?  
JAMIE: Because the Doctor said that, Well if you must know, I am cold.  
VICTORIA: Didn't I tell you? Now why don't you go and get that coat?  
JAMIE: Because I'm not leaving you out here on your own, and that's final.  
VICTORIA: Jamie, look.  
JAMIE: What is it?  
VICTORIA: Footprints. Look at the size of them. Something's been walking round
the Tardis. What could it be, Jamie, a bear?  
JAMIE: Whatever it is, it's pretty big. We'd better get inside.  
VICTORIA: I'd like to find out what it is first. Wouldn't you?  
JAMIE: Look, we must be careful. This could be dangerous. Wait while I get
that sword.

**[Monastery gate]**

(The Doctor approaches the gate set in the monastery wall. He is carrying
Travers' rucksack. He knocks. He knocks again.)  
DOCTOR: Hello there?  
(No sound but the wind. The Doctor knocks again then pushes at the small
wicket gate, which creaks open.)

**[Courtyard]**

(It is deserted. Cloisters run down one side and doors leading to the
interior. At the far end is a statue of Buddha, on a plinth. The Doctor walks
over to it. Then he tries one of the doors, but it is locked.)  
DOCTOR: Hello? Where is everybody?  
(He turns around to see a small band of warrior monks with swords drawn. The
gate is closing behind them. A bearded European with bandaged head is with
them.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. I thought, I thought for one moment.  
KHRISONG: (warrior leader) What do you want here?  
DOCTOR: I've come to  
TRAVERS: Look! He's got my rucksack.  
DOCTOR: Oh, that. Oh.  
TRAVERS: You murderous devil.  
KHRISONG: Who is this man?  
TRAVERS: I don't know, but this is mine all right.  
THOMNI: (young monk) But you said it was  
KHRISONG: Be silent. You said it was a beast that attacked you.  
TRAVERS: Yes, but it was dark, remember. All I could see was a vague shape,
but I felt its hair. Well it's quite obvious now it's this coat he's wearing.  
KHRISONG: Why did you attack this man?  
DOCTOR: Me? I haven't attacked anyone. I found the haversack on the mountain.  
TRAVERS: He's lying.  
DOCTOR: I also found a dead man.  
TRAVERS: Yes, and you killed him.  
KHRISONG: Enough. Seize him.  
DOCTOR: But you can't possibly  
KHRISONG: Silence. This man accuses you of one crime, but there have been many
others. If you are responsible, be sure you will be punished. Take him away.  
DOCTOR: But this is ridiculous. Why don't you listen to me? Where are you
taking me?  
TRAVERS: Watch him carefully, Khrisong. He's dangerous.  
KHRISONG: This is possible.  
THOMNI: We do not know he is the attacker.  
TRAVERS: Of course he is. I've just said he's so.  
THOMNI: Why then did he come here?  
KHRISONG: That also we shall discover.

**[Cell]**

(The Doctor is thrown into a small stone cell with high windows and a straw
bed.)  
DOCTOR: The welcome of a life time?

**[Mountainside]**

(Just below the peak, Victoria and Jamie see tracks leading in and out.)  
VICTORIA: Jamie, look.  
JAMIE: Aye, that'll be where the beastie lives, right enough. And it's as far
as we're going.  
VICTORIA: Oh, we can't turn back now.  
JAMIE: We can and we will. It could be dangerous.  
VICTORIA: How do you know? It may be quite harmless.  
JAMIE: With feet that size?  
VICTORIA: Well just a quick look inside.  
JAMIE: Look, if that animal is dangerous we could be walking into a trap.  
VICTORIA: Oh, but Jamie.  
JAMIE: No, we're going back. I mean it.  
VICTORIA: Jamie. Look.  
JAMIE: Hey. Wait a minute.  
VICTORIA: Well, what is it?  
JAMIE: Look there, just inside the cave.  
VICTORIA: Where? I can't see anything.

**[Cave]**

JAMIE: It looks like a beam of wood.  
VICTORIA: Oh it can't be.  
JAMIE: It might not be an animal's den after all. I'm going to take a closer
look.  
VICTORIA: Oh but Jamie.  
JAMIE: Look, a wild animal's one thing. I'm not afraid of a man. This is a
man's work all right.  
VICTORIA: Oh let's go back, Jamie. Jamie. Jamie!  
JAMIE: Hey, come and a look at this.  
VICTORIA: Jamie, listen. There's something coming.  
JAMIE: Get back.  
(They take cover by the entrance. Outside, two scaly claws move a huge boulder
across the opening, shutting them in.)

**[Cell]**

(The Doctor lies on the bed and looks up at the window. He gets up and tries
jumping up to see out of it, but it is too high. Then he tries standing on a
stool. Now he can see out. The shutter in his cell door opens.)  
TRAVERS: It's a hundred foot drop outside that window. There's no way out, you
know.  
DOCTOR: I didn't think there would be.  
TRAVERS: How did you track me down?  
DOCTOR: Track you down? I don't even know who you are.  
TRAVERS: Don't play the innocent with me. It won't work. If it wasn't for my
expedition you wouldn't be here. You're one of those wretched newspaper men.  
DOCTOR: Paper men? I wish I know what you are talking about?  
TRAVERS: Oh, yes. You laughed at me in the press didn't you. Travers, the mad
anthropologist. After that, even my own Society wouldn't finance me. But I
know they're here. Twenty years I've been searching.  
DOCTOR: Twenty years.  
TRAVERS: I've staked my reputation and every penny I own on this expedition.
Now, when I'm close to finding them, you want to steal my glory just for the
sake of a cheap headline.  
DOCTOR: Finding them? Finding what?  
TRAVERS: Don't pretend. They're here, somewhere on these mountains.  
DOCTOR: What are?.  
TRAVERS: You know. The Yeti. The Abominable Snowmen.

**[Cave]**

(Jamie is trying to move the boulder.)  
JAMIE: Oh, it's not use, I can't shift it. Perhaps there's another way out of
here. I'm going to see what's down there.  
VICTORIA: Oh, no, don't. There may be more of them.  
JAMIE: Aye, there might. That's why I want you to stay here.  
VICTORIA: Oh no.  
JAMIE: Look, you're safe enough for the moment. If you need me just yell your
head off.  
VICTORIA: Don't worry, I will!

**[Cell]**

DOCTOR: But it could have been the Yeti that attacked you.  
TRAVERS: Rubbish. The Yeti are timid creatures. They're shy.  
DOCTOR: But  
TRAVERS: They're afraid of men.  
DOCTOR: Why me? Why say I did it?  
TRAVERS: You want a clear field, don't you. I discovered the Yeti. The
honour's mine, but you want to take it from me. Why, you even murdered my
companion just to get a cheap story for your newspaper.  
DOCTOR: That is ridiculous.  
TRAVERS: Is it?  
DOCTOR: Whoever killed your friend had enormous strength.  
TRAVERS: Yes?  
DOCTOR: Well, could I have done it? Well, could I?  
TRAVERS: I'm not going to discuss it any further. There's work to be done. The
expedition must go on. Khrisong will find out the truth.  
DOCTOR: Travers. Travers, come back!

**[Courtyard]**

KHRISONG: We have the word of the Englishman, Travers.  
THOMNI: But how do we know he is telling the truth?  
KHRISONG: Why should he lie? In any case, I am not so concerned with the death
of Travers's companion. Four of our brothers have been slaughtered. That is my
concern.  
RINCHEN: (a lama) Had we not agreed that the Yeti were responsible?  
KHRISONG: True, Rinchen. But have we not also wondered why? They were so
rarely seen. Timid. Then, suddenly, they become savage. Did we not wonder why?
Did we not wonder what or whom had brought this change. And now, here is this
stranger and Travers accuses him. He may be the cause. I ask you again, let me
put it to the truth. Now.  
RINCHEN: You are asking us to condemn a man to certain death.  
KHRISONG: I am Chief Warrior. Is it not my duty to protect you?  
RINCHEN: But not by taking a man's life.  
KHRISONG: Yes, if it is necessary.  
SAPAN: (a lama) No. Only the Abbot can decide. Songsten alone can approve such
measures.  
(A gong sounds.)  
RINCHEN: It is time for prayer, my brothers.  
(The lamas go to the cloisters. Chanting starts.)  
KHRISONG: Wait! We must decide now.  
SAPAN: No, Khrisong. After our meditations we will consult the Abbot.  
KHRISONG: This is foolishness. Time will be wasted. Do they wish more of our
brothers to die before I'm allowed to take action.  
THOMNI: There is no other way.  
KHRISONG: There is, for me. Let them meditate. Let them consult. I, Khrisong,
will act. Bring me the prisoner.

**[Cave]**

(Jamie follow a tunnel into a circular chamber with a wooden prop supporting
the entrance. It is not very strong, and some small rocks fall when Jamie
nudges it. In the middle of the chamber is a pyramid of six inch silver
spheres.)  
VICTORIA [OC]: Jamie, Jamie! It's coming back.  
JAMIE: Get back in there.  
VICTORIA: Oh, is it safe?  
JAMIE: Aye. Now go on.  
(Jamie pushes Victoria towards the chamber as the boulder is taken from the
entrance. A huge, fur covered creature enters on its hind legs.)  
VICTORIA: Jamie, get back! It'll kill you!  
(The creature takes Jamie's sword from him and breaks it in two. Victoria
screams.)

__**Episode Two**__

(From the Lost in Time DVD)

**[Cave]**

JAMIE: Keep back, Victoria. I can't stop it.  
(Jamie runs back to the main chamber and pushes at the pit prop.)  
VICTORIA: Jamie, the roof. What are you doing?  
(Jamie grabs another piece of wood.)  
JAMIE: We've got to stop that thing somehow.  
VICTORIA: You'll bury us alive!  
JAMIE: It's our only chance. Now get back.  
(Jamie swings at the pit prop, bringing the tunnel roof down just as the Yeti
reaches them. A single claw is sticking up through the rubble.)  
JAMIE: Are you all right?  
VICTORIA: That horrible thing. What was it?  
JAMIE: I don't know. Did you see what it did to my sword, though? Broke it
like a piece of wood. No human's as strong as that.  
VICTORIA: What is this place? And what are those?  
JAMIE: Some sort of metal. They're all glowing.  
(Jamie picks up the top-most sphere.)  
VICTORIA: Oh, let's get away from here, Jamie.  
JAMIE: Aye, if we can. I don't think that tunnel's completely blocked. Come
on.  
(He puts the sphere in his bag and they walk past the buried Yeti.)  
JAMIE: Oh, don't worry about that, it's quite dead.  
(The claw moves. Victoria looks back and gasps.)  
JAMIE: What's the matter?  
VICTORIA: Look.  
(The Yeti starts to get up.)  
JAMIE: Come on!

**[Cell]**

(The DOCTOR plays 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' on his recorder. Thomni
enters.)  
THOMNI: Come.  
DOCTOR: Ah, and about time too. Come to release me, have you?  
THOMNI: No, sir.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, well, first things first. What's your name?  
THOMNI: Thomni. You must come with me.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I see, Thomni. After we've had a little chat.  
THOMNI: Khrisong will be waiting.  
DOCTOR: No, no. Just wait. No one seems to want to listen to me and everyone
is jumping to the wrong conclusions. Now, you seem to be a reasonable sort of
chap. What's going on here?  
THOMNI: We are besieged. The Yeti have turned upon us. At least, that is what
we thought until  
DOCTOR: Until I turned up. I see. Every time I visit Detsen the monastery
seems to be in some sort of trouble or another.  
THOMNI: You have been here before?  
DOCTOR: That attack in 1630, what was the outcome?  
THOMNI: You know something of our history.  
DOCTOR: Yes, a little.  
THOMNI: Ah, that was also a dark period. It was then our holy Ghana was taken
from us.  
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Never mind, I'm sure it'll turn up again.  
THOMNI: Legend tells us so, but after so  
DOCTOR: This chap Travers. This chap Travers, what of him?  
THOMNI: Sir, there is no time to talk, Khrisong will be angry.  
DOCTOR: Ah yes, he may be angry, but he's not the Abbot, is he?  
THOMNI: No.  
DOCTOR: No. I don't think you'll find the Abbot will be angry when he sees
what I've bought with me.  
THOMNI: What do you mean? Show me.  
DOCTOR: I want you to help me to get this to the Abbot.  
(The Doctor reaches into the straw bed, then stands suddenly when Khrisong and
his guards enter .)  
KHRISONG: Why this delay? Seize him. Take him to the gate.  
(The guards take the Doctor out.)  
DOCTOR: Abbot. The straw.

**[Corridor]**

KHRISONG: Follow me.  
(The Doctor is led away. Khrisong follows, them Thomni. But he pauses and
returns to the cell. Thomni finds the bag under the straw mattress and takes
out the bell. Reverently, he kneels, places the bell on the bed and prays.)

**[Mountainside]**

(Jamie and Victoria are running down the slope with the Yeti behind them.)  
JAMIE: Victoria, the Tardis is that way.  
VICTORIA: I know, but we must warn the Doctor.  
JAMIE: How can we? We don't know where he is?  
VICTORIA: Jamie!  
JAMIE: Run!

**[Courtyard]**

RINCHEN: Khrisong. Khrisong.  
KHRISONG: Do not interfere, Rinchen.  
RINCHEN: Did we not decide we would consult the Abbot, Songsten, before taking
action?  
KHRISONG: We? You mean you had decided. The time for talk is past.  
RINCHEN: But, Khrisong, the Abbot must  
KHRISONG: The Abbot. Must I always consult the Abbot before I take decisive
action?  
DOCTOR: Travers, don't you think this has gone far enough?  
TRAVERS: Well, there's nothing I can do.  
DOCTOR: What do you hope to gain?  
TRAVERS: Time.  
DOCTOR: Time?  
TRAVERS: Look, you killed my companion, left me single handed, but don't
worry, you won't get another chance of getting in my way. I shall find the
Yeti, with or without help.  
DOCTOR: You can't possibly leave  
TRAVERS: Can't I? You'll be quite safe here and I know where you are. I'm
going. Now, don't worry. The monks won't harm you. They're men of peace.  
DOCTOR: Men of peace?  
RINCHEN: You are asking us  
(Travers bows to Rinchen, Khrisong and Sapan, and leaves.)  
RINCHEN: You are asking us to agree to murder.  
KHRISONG: No. Our hands will be clean.  
SAPAN: After deliberately using him as bait? You cannot be so ruthless.  
KHRISONG: Sapan, I believe that this man is, for some reason, trying to turn
the Yeti into savage creatures.  
SAPAN: But what proof is there?  
KHRISONG: You heard the word of Travers. He's an Englishman, a stranger. He's
a killer. Let me tie him to the gate. If the Yeti come to rescue him, we will
know the truth, and my warriors will be waiting.  
SAPAN: But if he is innocent?  
KHRISONG: My warriors will protect him.  
RINCHEN: Khrisong, there may be wisdom in what you say. All we ask is that you
wait until the  
KHRISONG: No. I have done with waiting. Bring him to the gate.  
(The Doctor is taken outside the monastery.)

**[Sanctum]**

(Thomni is reverently carrying the bell when the inner door opens. He quickly
prostrates himself as a man in a white shawl comes out.)  
THOMNI: Master Abbot. (getting up) Abbot Songsten. Forgive me, Abbot.  
SONGSTEN: Thomni.  
THOMNI: I'm sorry, but  
SONGSTEN: You know well that only I may enter here. What is this?  
(Songsten takes the Ghanta.)  
SONGSTEN: Where did you get this?  
THOMNI: Is it not the Ghanta that was lost?  
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: (a gentle, saintly voice) It is, my son.  
(The monks fall to their knees.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: Two hundred years or more it has been lost to us. How came
you by it?  
SONGSTEN: It is the Master, Padmasambhava. Do not be afraid. Answer him.  
THOMNI: A stranger brought it, Master.  
VOICE [OC]: (harsh and rasping) The Doctor. So. He has returned.  
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: Bring the Ghanta to me, my son.  
(Songsten gives Thomni the Ghanta and opens the inner sanctum doors.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: Both of you. Do not be afraid, Thomni.

**[Monastery gate]**

(The Doctor's hand are tied above his head.)  
KHRISONG: Rapalchan, watch from the window there. Kheda, you, the other
window. Any attempt to rescue you will now be highly dangerous for you.  
DOCTOR: Look, nobody is going to rescue me, least of all an abominable
snowman. And hasn't it occurred to you, that innocent or guilty, whatever's
been killing your monks might very well kill me.  
KHRISONG: If you are innocent, then let us hope that we will have the time to
rescue you.

**[Mountainside]**

JAMIE: I think we've shaken it off.  
VICTORIA: Have we? Oh, good.  
JAMIE: Come on. It can't be much further. Listen.  
VICTORIA: Now what is it?  
JAMIE: Something's coming. Come on.  
(They hide behind a outcrop as Travers comes up the slope. He points his rifle
at them.)  
TRAVERS: Here, who the devil are you? What are you doing here?  
JAMIE: We're on our way to the monastery.  
TRAVERS: Are you indeed? You're a strange pair to find roaming round these
mountains. You aren't anything to do with that newspaper fellow, I suppose?  
JAMIE: What do you mean?  
TRAVERS: Well, he says he's a Doctor, but I know what he's really after.  
VICTORIA: Oh, have you seen him?  
TRAVERS: Oh yes, I've seen him.  
JAMIE: Is he all right?  
TRAVERS: Oh yes, he's quite all right. So, you're going to the monastery, are
you? Good. I think you'll find those lamas have quite a welcome waiting for
you.  
VICTORIA: The Doctor said there would be.  
TRAVERS: Did he now?  
JAMIE: Oh, I wouldn't go that way if I was you.  
TRAVERS: Wouldn't you?  
VICTORIA: There's something up there.  
JAMIE: Aye, a great hairy beastie.  
TRAVERS: Where?  
JAMIE: In a cave.  
TRAVERS: A cave? Have you found their cave?  
JAMIE: Aye.  
TRAVERS: Will you show me where it is?  
VICTORIA: Oh, no.  
JAMIE: No, I couldn't go back there, not with Victoria.  
TRAVERS: Now look here, young fellow, do stop playing games with me. I know
that you and that Doctor fellow are after the Yeti.  
VICTORIA: Yeti? What's he talking about?  
TRAVERS: Are you trying to tell me you're not part of some press expedition?  
JAMIE: Expedition?  
VICTORIA: We're not part of anything. We're just visiting the monastery.  
TRAVERS: But the cave.  
JAMIE: Look, if you're that keen to tangle with that beastie I'll show you
where the cave is.  
TRAVERS: You will?  
JAMIE: After you've shown us how to get to the monastery.  
TRAVERS: All right. I've nothing to lose, I suppose. All right, come with me.

**[Inner sanctum]**

(Two burning lamps are either side of plain closed doors.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Tell me, my son. Is the Doctor alone?  
THOMNI: Yes, Master.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: We are grateful for the return of the holy Ghanta. The Doctor
is our friend. He must be treated with respect and kindness. Thomni, you will
go to Khrisong. Tell him the Abbot orders the release of the Doctor. Go now.
Remember, these words were spoken by the Abbot here. You will forget that you
have entered this room or that you have spoken to me.  
(Thonmi walks slowly out and pulls the doors shut.)  
VOICE [OC]: Therefore, Songsten, we must make certain that Doctor learns
nothing of what is happening. He is a man of great knowledge and intelligence,
but he may not show sympathy for the powers that guide us. He may even seek to
hinder the Great Plan.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: It might be wise if he departs as soon as possible.

**[Monastery gate]**

(Up at the window, the guards see movement.)  
RALPACHAN: Khidom. In the rocks. Did you see something? Something is coming.
Khrisong, the Yeti. The Yeti!  
DOCTOR: Oh no.  
KHRISONG [OC]: Be ready to kill them.  
(Travers, Jamie and Victoria come around a rocky outcrop.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie! Victoria! Keep back!  
VICTORIA: Oh, look!  
DOCTOR: Keep back! They'll kill you!  
(The three run down to the monastery.)  
DOCTOR: Keep away! Get away!  
(Khrisong and his guards come out.)  
KHRISONG: You see? I was right.  
TRAVERS: Khrisong! Khrisong, it was all a mistake.  
JAMIE: Doctor.  
TRAVERS: I've been talking to these youngsters. I'm sorry. This is not the man
that attacked me.  
KHRISONG: Seize them.  
JAMIE: Hey, what's going on?  
DOCTOR: I told you to keep away. He's lead you into a trap.  
TRAVERS: No, Doctor, believe me.  
KHRISONG: Silence. Who are these people?  
TRAVERS: They're friends of his.  
KHRISONG: Then they shall act as hostages also.  
(Thomni comes out of the monastery.)  
THOMNI: Khrisong.  
KHRISONG: Where have you been?  
THOMNI: With the Abbot. He has given me instructions  
KHRISONG: The Abbot? I gave you no instructions to be with the Abbot..  
THOMNI: But, Khrisong, we must release him. This stranger has brought back to
us the holy Ghanta that was lost. We must treat him with respect and kindness.
These are the words of our Abbot.  
KHRISONG: Is this true?  
DOCTOR: Of course.  
KHRISONG: Then why did you not tell me?  
DOCTOR: You'd already accused me of murder. You were hardly in the right frame
of mind to listen to my story of how I came by the bell, now where you? Oh
please.  
(The Doctor is untied.)  
DOCTOR: This wasn't the welcome I expected, you know. As for you, Travers.

**[Inner sanctum]**

VOICE [OC]: It is well to remember that nothing must disturb our preparations.
There is little time left now.  
SONGSTEN: How, if the Doctor will not go?  
PADMASAMBHAVA: His life could be in great danger. He has been a good friend in
the past. It would be ill if the life of such a one became in peril.

**[Courtyard]**

DOCTOR: You say you found this in the cave?  
JAMIE: Aye.  
VICTORIA: There were lots of them.  
JAMIE: Well, what do you think it is, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I've no idea. Now, this creature, what was it like?  
JAMIE: Oh, it was huge and all covered with hair, like a sort of bear.  
VICTORIA: It attacked us.  
DOCTOR: It does sound like your abominable snowman, Travers.  
TRAVERS: Oh, but they wouldn't attack anyone.  
DOCTOR: No, I always thought so.  
TRAVERS: They're shy, elusive creatures. Why do you think it's taken me so
long to track them down?  
DOCTOR: What made this? I wonder what it's for. Oh well.  
(The Doctor puts the sphere on the ground. )  
DOCTOR: I'd like to see one of these creatures.  
VICTORIA: It was horrible.  
JAMIE: Aye, it was buried under tons of rock, yet it still just got up and
came after us.  
VICTORIA: Like a nightmare.  
TRAVERS: Now, fear makes us imagine all sorts of things.  
DOCTOR: Including creatures that don't seem to be flesh and blood.  
RALPACHAN [OC]: Khrisong. Khrisong.  
DOCTOR: What is it?  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: What's the matter?  
RALPACHAN [OC]: Khrisong!  
JAMIE: What's he seen?  
RALPACHAN [OC]: Khrisong, come quickly.  
KHRISONG: What is it?  
JAMIE: He must have seen something.  
RALPACHAN [OC]: Look.  
(There are three Yetis on the mountainside.)  
TRAVERS: There they are at last.  
JAMIE: Hey, yes.  
TRAVERS: After all these years.  
KHRISONG: Ralpachan, stand watch at the walls. Pletu, I want two men either
side of this base. Thomni, come with me.  
TRAVERS: Look. They're magnificent. Just as I thought they'd be.  
DOCTOR: Do you really think they'll attack?  
KHRISONG: I don't know. They have never been this close before.  
TRAVERS: Of course they wouldn't attack anyone. They're timid. You'll see.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but if they do, do you think you could capture one? I would like
to examine one.  
JAMIE: Examine it? Aye, we'll wrap it up for you.  
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jamie.  
KHRISONG: Thomni, come. We must see to the defences. Boy, help at the gates.  
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, if you really want to capture one of these beasties, I
think I have an idea which might just work.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Victoria?  
JAMIE: Eh?  
DOCTOR: Victoria, I think this is one of those instances where discretion is
the better part of valour. Jamie has an idea. Come along.  
JAMIE: No, Doctor  
DOCTOR: Come along.  
(The Doctor and Victoria go into the monastery buildings.)

**[Meeting room]**

SONGSTEN: Have no fear. Now that the holy Ghanta has been returned to us, all
will be well.  
RINCHEN: But what if the Yeti do attack?  
SONGSTEN: Have faith, Rinchen. Khrisong and his warriors will protect us.  
SAPAN: Khrisong is a rash man. He was so sure that this Doctor was a threat to
us.  
DOCTOR: I can assure you I am not.

**[Monastery gate]**

JAMIE: I hope this is going to work. You ready up there? Catch.  
(JAMIE throws a rope up to a monk above the gate.)  
THOMNI: There is one coming.  
JAMIE: Aye, one's enough.  
THOMNI: The others don't seem to be moving.  
JAMIE: Keep it back. I'm not ready for it yet.  
THOMNI: Keep it back.  
JAMIE: That's it. Stand by, here it comes. (The Yeti arrives) Now!  
(The monks beat the Yeti with their sticks.)  
JAMIE: Right, haul the rope, quick. Quick with the net. Pull hard. Up with it  
(The Yeti is trapped as the monks continue to beat it. Then it suddenly goes
limp.)  
JAMIE: Wait, wait.  
THOMNI: It, it's dead.  
JAMIE: Aye. Hey, why aren't the others attacking?  
(The other two Yeti go back up the mountain.)  
THOMNI: They're going.  
JAMIE: Good. Let's get this one inside.  
(As they try to drag the big animal inside the monastery, we pan across to a
silver globe on the ground nearby. It starts to roll away, making a little
noise.)

**[Courtyard]**

(Evening prayer are going on as a monk walks across with a flaming torch. He
sees something glinting by the base Buddha. He picks up the sphere, looks at
it, then puts it down again.)

**[Meeting room]**

(The Yeti is laid out on a table.)  
DOCTOR: You were right about one thing, Victoria. This creature certainly
doesn't seem to be flesh and blood.  
TRAVERS: What?  
DOCTOR: It's not your abominable snowman either, Travers. Look.  
(The Doctor hits the Yeti.)  
DOCTOR: It's metal.  
TRAVERS: That's incredible.  
THOMNI: What is it?  
KHRISONG: A devil's warrior.  
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so. It's more like a robot.  
TRAVERS: A robot? My dear chap, don't let your imagination run away with you.  
DOCTOR: Now, why has it stopped? Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  
(The Doctor rolls back a flap of fur to find an empty circular hole.)  
VICTORIA: Nothing there.  
DOCTOR: No, but there has been.  
(The sphere outside the gate is still beeping and stuck in the mud. Meanwhile,
the one by the Buddha starts beeping and rolling too.)

__**Episode Three**__

**[Meeting room]**

DOCTOR: Jamie, when you captured this creature, you must have dislodged it's
control unit.  
JAMIE: Then it must still be lying out there.  
DOCTOR: Precisely.  
KHRISONG: Where are you going?  
DOCTOR: To have a look outside the gates. I want that unit. Come on, Jamie.  
KHRISONG: No. I will not allow it.  
DOCTOR: But why not?  
KHRISONG: I trust no one to leave the monastery. You say this creature is not
a real Yeti.  
TRAVERS: It's metal. It's been made.  
KHRISONG: And sent against us. Why? Why does someone wish harm to the monks of
Detsen. I will trust no stranger until these questions are answered.  
JAMIE: Oh, but we're on your side. Have we not convinced you yet?  
KHRISONG: I am convinced of nothing.  
VICTORIA: The Doctor knows all about this sort of thing. Why not let him help
you?  
DOCTOR: Well if you don't trust us at least send Thomni, or one of your other
warriors.  
KHRISONG: No. I will not allow the gates to be opened.  
DOCTOR: If you want us to help you.  
KHRISONG: I do not need your help. Thomni, guard them.  
(Khrisong leaves.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. A very obstinate man.  
TRAVERS: Yes, well, that's that I suppose. Nothing we can do about it now.
Well I'll just go and get a bit of shut-eye. Good night all.

**[Courtyard]**

KHRISONG: Ralpachan.  
RALPACHAN: Yes, Khrisong.  
KHRISONG: Stand guard at the gate. No one is to leave the monastery. Be
watchful, these Yeti are more dangerous than we thought.  
TRAVERS: Khrisong.  
KHRISONG: What is it? What do you want?  
TRAVERS: Er, I want a word with you.  
KHRISONG: Well?  
TRAVERS: Alone.  
(Ralpachan goes to the gate.)  
KHRISONG: Yes?  
TRAVERS: Look, I've been thinking. Now that we've found out that these
abominable snowmen are mechanical things.  
KHRISONG: Well?  
TRAVERS: Don't you see? It means that I'm right. The real Yeti are there,
hiding up there somewhere in those mountains.  
KHRISONG: This is no concern of mine.  
TRAVERS: No, but Khrisong, wait. I want to go out there after them.  
KHRISONG: That would be foolishness.  
TRAVERS: Look, I've always said that the real Yeti are harmless. Now I must
find out for sure, otherwise the whole point of my expedition will be lost.  
KHRISONG: And those devil creatures would kill you.  
TRAVERS: Yes, well, that's a chance I'll have to take.  
KHRISONG: No. I will not allow it.  
TRAVERS: But don't you see? The real Yeti may be killed by these robots. Look,
I must go.  
KHRISONG: No, I forbid it.  
TRAVERS: Look, I'm not one of your monks, you know? You can't give me orders.  
KHRISONG: No. I have said that no one will leave. Anyone may be controlling
these monsters. Even you.  
TRAVERS: Oh, that's ridiculous.  
KHRISONG: I have given my orders. Obey them.

**[Meeting room]**

THOMNI: Sir, I have no choice. I must obey Khrisong.  
JAMIE: Do you not realise the man's a wee bit daffy?  
DOCTOR: Oh I wouldn't say that, Jamie. He's just doing his duty as he sees it.  
THOMNI: But I think he is mistaken not to trust you. There is much sense in
what you say.  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, Thomni.  
VICTORIA: Doctor? Come here a moment.  
DOCTOR: What is it?  
VICTORIA: The place you said where the control unit would go, it's round.  
DOCTOR: Yes?  
VICTORIA: Well I wonder if? Jamie, you remember in that cave, we found that
sphere. Well, don't you think it could go.  
JAMIE: Hey, yes. I believe you're right.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but I've thought of that. But the thing was as light as a
feather. There couldn't have been anything inside it. Unless. Where is it?  
JAMIE: Why, I gave it to you. You were looking at it.  
DOCTOR: I remember. I put it down somewhere.  
VICTORIA: The Buddha. The Buddha in the courtyard.  
DOCTOR: The Buddha. I put it down by the Buddha. Oh now, please, Thomni.
Please.  
(Thomni lets them leave.)

**[Courtyard]**

JAMIE: It's not here, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: But I swear I put it down here by the Buddha.  
JAMIE: Aye, well, it's not here now.  
VICTORIA: Somebody must have picked it up.  
DOCTOR: Oh dear.  
VICTORIA: Maybe that guard's taken it.  
JAMIE: Aye, let's ask him.  
(As they walk towards the gate, the sphere rolls towards the cloisters.)  
DOCTOR: No, tact, Jamie. I'll handle this. Hello, guard. good evening. I
wonder if you can help us. I left a silver sphere by the Buddha there.  
RALPACHAN: Sphere?  
VICTORIA: It's a shiny round thing.  
THOMNI: It's most important. Have you taken it?  
RALPACHAN: No, and if anyone had I should have seen them.  
THOMNI: Ralpachan, who has passed through the courtyard?  
RALPACHAN: Master Khrisong, but he touched nothing.  
JAMIE: No one else?  
RALPACHAN: The Englishman, Travers.  
DOCTOR: Travers? Are you sure he didn't pick it up?  
RALPACHAN: I am sure. He spoke only to Khrisong and now he is gone.  
DOCTOR: Gone?  
RALPACHAN: He said Khrisong had given him permission to leave.  
DOCTOR: But that's impossible.  
THOMNI: He has tricked you.  
JAMIE: Aye, he must have taken it.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but why?  
VICTORIA: Could he be the one that's doing it?  
DOCTOR: I wonder. Are you sure he didn't take the sphere with him?  
RALPACHAN: He took nothing.  
JAMIE: I'll find his room and search it.  
DOCTOR: Right, Jamie.  
THOMNI: We must tell Khrisong what has happened.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Travers. I can't believe he has anything to do with these
robots.  
VICTORIA: One thing's for certain. It couldn't have moved on its own.

**[Meeting room]**

(The sphere is heading here, where a wooden framework has been built around
the Yeti.)  
SAPAN: How if the devil should breath life into it again?  
RINCHEN: My ghost trap will ward off the evil spirits.  
SAPAN: Hmm. But to fetter it with chains is also wise. The strangers say that
this creature is not flesh and blood.  
RINCHEN: How can this be? Does it not move? Strangers? Do not believe them,
Sapan.  
SAPAN: But see.  
RINCHEN: It is but armour, such as any warrior would wear. The devil in his
guile wears his armour beneath the skin to protect his evil heart.  
SAPAN: Such a being is against nature. It troubles me. Let us go.  
SONGSTEN: What have you been doing, my brothers?  
SAPAN: We have built a spirit trap about the monster, my Abbot.  
SONGSTEN: This is well thought, Sapan. You are wise.  
(Sapan leaves.)  
RINCHEN: You should never have allowed this monster to have been brought into
the monastery, Khrisong.  
KHRISONG: What I allow is my affair, Rinchen.  
(Rinchen leaves.)  
SONGSTEN: Gently, my son. Gently.  
KHRISONG: I'm sorry, my Abbot. I try to guard my tongue, but Rinchen finds
much fault in me of late.  
SONGSTEN: Harsh words are like blunted arrows. It is the truth that makes them
sharp.  
KHRISONG: I have tried to do my duty. Under your guidance, the protection of
the monastery lies in my hands.  
SONGSTEN: I know, my son. Your task is a hard one.  
KHRISONG: And such is our adversary, that against such creatures that I must
protect you. The purpose of my life is nothing if I fail. You know, my Abbot,
that I willingly would lay down my life for you and my brothers. But can I
combat this with mildness? You must let me fight their strength with my
strength.  
SONGSTEN: Our ways are the ways of peace, Khrisong, my son. You, must not seek
to change them.  
KHRISONG: I would fight to preserve them. You must let me. There is no other
way.  
SONGSTEN: There is. It is merely obscured to our simple minds. I shall seek
guidance from the Master, Padmasambhava.  
(The Doctor enters with Victoria and Thomni.)  
DOCTOR: Khrisong. Khrisong, I must speak with you.  
KHRISONG: What is it?  
DOCTOR: Have you given Travers permission to leave the monastery?  
KHRISONG: Of course not.  
DOCTOR: Well, he's gone.  
KHRISONG: How?  
DOCTOR: The guard at the gate said you'd given him permission.  
KHRISONG: Did he? Very well. Come with me.  
DOCTOR: It's about time you let me help you.  
KHRISONG: Help? I want to make sure you don't disappear as well.  
(Khrisong leaves with the Doctor following.)  
VICTORIA: It's the Abbot. Is he all right?  
THOMNI: Oh, yes. He's in a trance. We must leave him now.  
VICTORIA: Trance?  
SONGSTEN: Yes, Master  
VICTORIA: Who's he talking to?  
THOMNI: The Master, Padmasambhava. He's asking for spiritual guidance.  
VICTORIA: How?  
SONGSTEN: I hear you, Master. I am coming.  
(Songsten leaves.)  
VICTORIA: Where's he going?  
THOMNI: To the Holy Sanctum. To Padmasambhava.  
VICTORIA: Let's follow him.  
THOMNI: No, no, no. It is forbidden. No one but the Abbot may enter. No one!

**[Courtyard]**

KHRISONG: And this should not have happened. I hold you responsible,
Ralpachan.  
DOCTOR: Oh well, what's done is done. Ah, Jamie.  
JAMIE: I searched his room, but it's not there.  
DOCTOR: I see. Khrisong, you must see that it is vital that I examine one of
these control units. Now, the one that Jamie bought down from the mountains
has disappeared. Someone is trying to stop us learning the truth.  
JAMIE: You must let us outside to find the other one. Och, look.  
(Khrisong paces for a moment.)  
KHRISONG: Very well. I will go.

**[Inner sanctum]**

(There is a small table with a relief map of the monastery and its surrounding
area laid out before Padmasambhava's throne. As his claw-like hand moves three
miniature Yeti figures into a group, the action is replicated by their full-
sized counterparts.)

**[Corridor]**

(Songsten is followed by Victoria and Thomni.)  
THOMNI: No! No, Miss Victoria, we mustn't.  
VICTORIA: I only want to see where he's going.  
THOMNI: I told you, the Sanctum. No one is allowed to go there. Please, let us
go back.  
VICTORIA: You mean to say you've lived here all this time and never been in
there.  
THOMNI: Yes.  
VICTORIA: You are funny. Aren't you the tiniest bit curious?  
THOMNI: No.  
VICTORIA: And you've never seen this Master?  
THOMNI: Never.  
VICTORIA: Don't you want to know what he looks like? Oh, sure you do. Come on.  
THOMNI: No, Miss Victoria. Can't you understand it is impossible?  
VICTORIA: I don't see.  
THOMNI: No, you do not. It is forbidden, and I have been brought up in the
path of obedience.  
VICTORIA: Very well.  
(Songsten has entered the sanctum.)  
VICTORIA: But I'll get there somehow.

**[Monastery gate]**

DOCTOR: Hasn't he found it yet?  
JAMIE: No. Khrisong, can I give you a hand?  
KHRISONG: Stay where you are.

**[Inner sanctum]**

PADMASAMBHAVA: Far better if the Yeti had not been brought into the monastery.  
SONGSTEN: I am sorry, Master. I could not prevent it.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: The Doctor is wise. His eyes are not closed in ignorance.  
SONGSTEN: If he is not ignorant perhaps he might assist you with your plan.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: But his mind is on a complex plane. It is hard to fathom. There
is a chance he will oppose what we have to do.  
VOICE [OC]: No. We must continue with the work alone. I must now make sure our
plan is imperiled no more.  
(The wizened hand moves two more model Yeti towards the monastery.)

**[Monastery gate]**

(Khrisong finds the sphere stuck in the mud.)  
KHRISONG: I've found it.  
DOCTOR: Khrisong! Behind you. Yeti.  
(As Khrisong picks up the sphere, it beeps louder and faster, so he drops it
again.)  
JAMIE: Come in.  
KHRISONG: No.  
DOCTOR: Don't be a fool.  
(Diving to the ground, Khrisong picks up the sphere again as the Yeti arrive,
but he is surrounded.)  
JAMIE: Don't be a fool, they're on top of you.  
(Jamie, Ralpachan and the Doctor run to help Khrisong but the Yeti take the
sphere and throw him aside and leave.)  
DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. Quick, get him inside. They came to get their ball
back.

**[Inner sanctum]**

PADMASAMBHAVA: It would seem that the Yeti have caused some little upset at
the gates. However, their work is accomplished.  
(The hand takes the two Yeti from the board.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Now, Songsten, observe. These three Yeti are waiting for you.  
(He hands Songsten a small transparent pyramid.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Take this pyramid I have prepared. Take it to the caves. Then
the Great Intelligence will focus upon this planet. Soon it will begin to grow
and at last take on physical form. At last its wanderings in space will be at
an end. My work will then be done. Go now, Songsten. Do as I have asked.  
VOICE [OC]: Nothing must interfere.

**[Courtyard]**

RINCHEN: These creatures are indeed fearsome.  
JAMIE: Aye, you were lucky you weren't killed.  
KHRISONG: But why did they just turn and leave? They had us at their mercy.
Why?  
DOCTOR: They didn't come to fight. They came for the sphere.  
JAMIE: Are you sure?  
DOCTOR: Pretty sure. They didn't want me to examine it.  
KHRISONG: You talk of these creatures as if they were human, with a human's
brain.  
DOCTOR: That sphere is like a brain. They had to get it back.  
JAMIE: Yes, and that Yeti we caught in the net. Well, that could have been
after the sphere we found in the cave.  
DOCTOR: I'd still like to know what happened to that one.  
(It is currently hiding in the shadows as Songsten walks down the corridor.
Once he has passed, it continues towards the meeting room.)  
DOCTOR: This sound that you heard.  
KHRISONG: It came from the sphere, I swear it.  
JAMIE: Some sort of signal, do you think?  
DOCTOR: Yes, it could be. Anyway, its a help.  
SAPAN: How can this help?  
DOCTOR: Well, with the right sort of equipment, these signals can be tracked.  
JAMIE: You mean you can find out where the Yeti are getting there instructions
from?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie.  
RINCHEN: Where can we find such equipment?  
DOCTOR: We've got to back to the Tardis.  
JAMIE: Right.  
KHRISONG: This equipment. You have it?  
DOCTOR: Yes. But it's outside there on the mountain.  
KHRISONG: Then, you must go for it.  
JAMIE: You mean you'll let us go?  
KHRISONG: I have no choice. I have failed. My warriors are powerless. I must
trust you.  
DOCTOR: Come on. Let's get me coat.

**[Meeting room]**

VICTORIA: Oh. Oh, they're not back yet. I think I'll go and find them. No need
for you to come.  
THOMNI: I think it would be better if I came with you.  
VICTORIA: Afraid I may go somewhere that I shouldn't? Oh, come on then. I
don't want to stay in here with that thing.  
RINCHEN: Thomni, it were well that you went to Khrisong.  
THOMNI: Where is he?  
RINCHEN: In the courtyard.  
THOMNI: I will go to him. Oh, Sapan, would you care for our guest, please?  
VICTORIA: Is Jamie and the Doctor. are they all right?  
SAPAN: Rest easily, my child.  
RINCHEN: They are in  
SAPAN: They are very well. There is no need for this child to worry. Is it not
so, Rinchen?  
VICTORIA: You're keeping something from me.  
SAPAN: My child, I have told you nothing but truth. Your friends are busy
helping our brothers.  
RINCHEN: Sapan, we have duties to perform.  
SAPAN: True. We must leave you. It might be wiser to join Thomni in the
courtyard? Excuse us, please.  
(Victoria is about to follow, but changes her mind and heads for the Sanctum
whilst the sphere is also heading for its destination.)  
THOMNI: You are not well, Khrisong. You should be resting.  
KHRISONG: There can be no rest for me while this creature is here.  
THOMNI: But it is dead. What harm can it do us now?  
KHRISONG: Even so, wiser to destroy it. Rinchen or the Doctor. Who is right? I
do not know any longer.  
(Rinchen brings Victoria in.)  
RINCHEN: Khrisong, you must guard this child. Sapan sent her to you in the
courtyard, yet I found her near the Sanctum.  
VICTORIA: I didn't mean any harm.  
RINCHEN: For her own good, it would be safer if she were closely guarded.

**[Mountainside]**

(The two Yeti which attacked Khrisong head up towards the cave with the
sphere, whilst Travers follows at a safe distance.)

**[Courtyard]**

(Ralpachan is standing guard when he sees movement in the courtyard. He leaves
the gates to investigate but finds nothing. When he turns back, Songsten is
there. The Abbot waves his hand in front of Ralpachan's face, hypnotising
him.)  
SONGSTEN: When I have passed through the gate, you will awake. You have seen
nothing.  
(Songsten leaves. Ralpachan wakes and shakes his head.)

**[Cell]**

VICTORIA: I suppose everyone thinks I'm a nuisance. Is that it?  
THOMNI: We are concerned for your safety, as you well know.  
VICTORIA: You're not really going to lock me up in this beastly room, are you?  
THOMNI: No, I don't think that will be necessary. But you must promise to
behave and not cause trouble.  
VICTORIA: What do you mean?  
THOMNI: I think perhaps you are a little too inquisitive, Miss Victoria.  
VICTORIA: Me? I just don't like mysteries. Your Master, for instance, Padma.  
THOMNI: I have told you there are some things that you should not ask.  
VICTORIA: Oh, all right, I'm sorry. All right. Look, do we have to stay here.
Can't I go and find the Doctor?  
THOMNI: The Doctor? But he's gone.  
VICTORIA: Gone? Gone where?  
THOMNI: To the mountain. I thought you knew. Did Sapan not tell you?  
VICTORIA: I knew he was keeping something from me. I've a good mind to go
after them.  
THOMNI: That would be foolish.  
VICTORIA: Don't worry, I'm not really serious.  
THOMNI: Oh, please, forgive me, I'm being a very bad host. Would you care for
some food?  
VICTORIA: No, thank you. Er, yes. Perhaps on second thoughts I will.  
(Thomni smiles and leaves. Once he is out of sight, Victoria leaves.)

**[Mountainside]**

(The Doctor and Jamie find the three Yeti.)  
DOCTOR: They're not moving.  
JAMIE: They can't have seen us, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Perhaps they're switched off? I wonder.  
JAMIE: Don't be a fool, Doctor. No point in taking chances. Let's get to the
Tardis while we can.  
DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps you're right. Come on.  
(They skirt around the Yeti. A few moment later, Songsten appears carrying the
pyramid. It starts to hum and the Yeti come to life, surrounding him. The Yeti
escort Songsten to the cave.)

**[Cell]**

(Thomni returns with food.)  
THOMNI: Oh, no! Miss Victoria!

**[Courtyard]**

THOMNI: Ralpachan. The girl, did she go out?  
KHRISONG: What did you want, Thomni?  
THOMNI: I went for food, now she has disappeared.  
KHRISONG: Fool.  
THOMNI: I think she went after the Doctor.  
KHRISONG: No one has passed Ralpachan.  
THOMNI: Then she must still be in the monastery.  
KHRISONG: Find her!  
THOMNI: Where? Where could she?

**[Sanctum]**

THOMNI [OC]: Miss Victoria!  
(Victoria sneaks in.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: It were better that you were not found in here, my child.  
VICTORIA: Who's that?  
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: The monks will look upon your presence here as sacrilege.  
VOICE [OC]: Go, quickly!

**[Meeting room]**

(The sphere rolls in. The flap in the Yeti's front opens to receive it.)  
THOMNI [OC]: Miss Victoria! Miss Victoria, where are you?  
(Victoria enters, but doesn't notice what is going on with the Yeti behind
her.)

**[Corridor]**

THOMNI: Miss Victoria!  
SAPAN: My son, what is the matter?  
THOMNI: Oh, Sapan. The girl, I can't find her. I think she may have  
(Victoria screams.)  
THOMNI: Miss Victoria!

**[Meeting room]**

(Victoria is cowering in the corner as the Yeti comes to life, snapping its
chains and rising from the table.)

__**Episode Four**__

**[Meeting room]**

VICTORIA: Oh, no. Thomni! Help, Thomni!  
THOMNI: Run, Miss Victoria! Run! Fetch Khrisong.  
(Thomni swings an incense burner at the Yeti, making it pause for a moment.)

**[Corridor]**

VICTORIA: The Yeti! The Yeti! Fetch help. Where's Khrisong?  
SAPAN: But where is Thomni? What has happened?  
VICTORIA: He's in there. He's coming. Now hurry!  
(The Yeti stands in the meeting room doorway, then moves away. Bleeding,
Thomni follows.)

**[Courtyard]**

SAPAN: Khrisong! The Yeti, it is alive.  
KHRISONG: What?  
VICTORIA: It's true, Khrisong. Quick, it's coming. Do something.  
(Thomni enters with the Yeti moments behind him.)  
KHRISONG: Get back! Get back! Ralpachan, help him. Get him. Get up.  
(The monks' swords and arrows have no effect. Thomni and Victoria get the main
gates open just in time for the Yeti to walk out of the monastery.)

**[Mountainside]**

JAMIE: What's the matter, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Oh? Oh, I'm just taking a breather, that's all.  
JAMIE: You've heard something?  
DOCTOR: No, no, nothing.  
JAMIE: Well, come on then.  
DOCTOR: Listen.  
JAMIE: Nothing.  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what's worrying me. It's too quiet. We've not seen a sign
of the Yeti since we left those three back there.  
JAMIE: Well, let's just be grateful and get to the Tardis.  
DOCTOR: I don't like it. There's something happening on this mountain. I can
feel it.  
JAMIE: Here, you're giving me the willies. Come on.  
(Meanwhile, two Yeti are approaching the cave. The one carrying the control
sphere stands outside while the other goes back down the mountain. Travers is
still watching, and sees Songsten and his escort approach the cave. Songsten
takes the sphere from the Yeti, which leaves. Then he goes into the cave
alone, leaving three Yeti standing guard.)  
JAMIE: Look, Doctor.  
(The Tardis is guarded by a Yeti. The Doctor and Jamie take cover behind a
rock.)  
DOCTOR: I thought we'd been too lucky.  
JAMIE: What now?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. We've got to get to the Tardis somehow.  
JAMIE: Aye, well you can't frighten one of those things away.  
DOCTOR: No.  
JAMIE: I wonder what he's waiting for?  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
JAMIE: Well, he couldn't have known we were coming.  
DOCTOR: It's a robot, Jamie. It merely follows instructions.  
JAMIE: Who's giving them?  
DOCTOR: That we shall have to find out, won't we?  
JAMIE: Get down, Doctor!

**[Inner Sanctum]**

PADMASAMBHAVA: Oh, Great Intelligence, have I served you well? After so many
years, can I feel the grip of your power loosen? How long before your great
experiment begins and I can rest? So soon? I am not sorry. What of the others?
It will be done. Songsten is making final preparations.

**[Cave]**

(The rockfall has been cleared, and the spheres are now arranged in a circle.
Songsten places the transparent pyramid in the middle and leaves. The pyramid
pulsates with light. Outside, Travers watches Songsten and his escort leave.
When they are out of sight, Travers goes to the cave.)

**[Outside the Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Yes.  
JAMIE: Have you thought up some clever plan, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, I believe I have.  
JAMIE: What are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: Bung a rock at it.  
JAMIE: Oh, be serious, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Jamie, I am.  
(The Doctor throws a rock at the Tardis.)  
JAMIE: Hey, no, Doctor.  
(The Yeti does not move.)  
DOCTOR: There you are, you see? Just as I thought. It can't see and it can't
feel. Come on.  
JAMIE: Don't be daft, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Well. it's quite all right, Jamie. It's like those three back there.
It's either switched off or not receiving. Come along.  
JAMIE: Are you sure it's quite safe?  
DOCTOR: Well, quite frankly, no, Jamie. But there's only one way of finding
out.  
(The Doctor goes up to the Yeti and touches it, then listens to its chest.)  
JAMIE: Don't, Doctor. You might switch it on.  
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so, Jamie. Yes, just as I thought. Now then.  
(The Doctor uses a screwdriver on the Yeti.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie, will you hold this flap open for me, please? Thank you.  
JAMIE: Hey you're taking an awful risk, Doctor.  
(The Doctor removes the control sphere.)  
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad that's over. Catch.  
JAMIE: Hey, I just thought of something, Doctor. The man that made these
robots is very clever, right?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
JAMIE: And yet we were able to walk right up to it and put it out of action
just like that.  
DOCTOR: You mean, why didn't they build in some sort of protective device?  
JAMIE: Aye.  
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps they didn't think it was necessary. I mean, look at him.
Would you walk up to a creature like that with just a screwdriver in your
hand?  
JAMIE: No, I would not.  
DOCTOR: No, there you are. I'm really rather pleased with myself.  
(The Doctor goes into the Tardis.)

**[Cave]**

(As Travers enters, the light from the pyramid grows brighter and it hums
loudly. Travers falls, covering his ears, as the pyramid opens and lets a
thick liquid ooze out onto the floor of the cave. Travers crawls out towards
the mountainside.)

**[Outside the Tardis]**

JAMIE: Have you not found it yet?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, Jamie. Sorry, I'm just coming.  
(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis with a small device. The control sphere
Jamie is holding starts to beep.)  
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Jamie?  
JAMIE: Look!  
DOCTOR: Ah, splendid, splendid. It's sending out a signal. That's just what we
wanted.  
(The sphere pulls Jamie towards the Yeti.)  
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, you'll have to help me or I'll let go.  
DOCTOR: Oh, no, you mustn't do that. Jamie, no!  
JAMIE: It's no use, I'll have to let go.  
DOCTOR: Whatever happens, you mustn't let go, Jamie.  
JAMIE: It's no use, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: No.  
(The Doctor stands between the sphere and the Yeti, getting crushed.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie, get a rock.  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: A rock! Put it in the hole in its chest.  
(Jamie manages to do so and the sphere falls to the ground.)  
JAMIE: Are you all right, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm all right. Just a bit puffed, that's all. Jamie, these things
are programmed to return to their Yetis. That one that disappeared in the
monastery. That wasn't taken.  
JAMIE: It moved itself. It could have got to the Yeti, the one we captured.
Come on.  
(Jamie picks up the sphere and they run down the mountainside.)

**[Meeting room]**

KHRISONG: You deliberately disobeyed my orders.  
THOMNI: It was the only sensible thing to do.  
KHRISONG: Be silent. If you had not opened the gate the creature would not
have escaped.  
VICTORIA: Khrisong, you know we couldn't stop it. You'd have been killed.
Anyway, it was my idea to open the gates.  
RINCHEN: Was it? Was it also your idea to breath life into the Yeti?  
VICTORIA: What do you mean?  
RINCHEN: Were you not with the creature when it came to life?  
VICTORIA: Yes, but  
SAPAN: You think that she was  
RINCHEN: Who else could have done this?  
THOMNI: Oh, this is foolishness.  
KHRISONG: Continue, Rinchen.  
RINCHEN: The creature was here, dead. What reason had you to enter this room?  
VICTORIA: I was hiding.  
RINCHEN: Hiding? Why? For what purpose?  
KHRISONG: Speak!  
THOMNI: She means no harm.  
KHRISONG: Be silent.  
RINCHEN: Your young warrior seems to anxious to protect this stranger. What
are they plotting, these two?  
THOMNI: No! You do not understand.  
RINCHEN: Where is your authority, Khrisong, that your warriors forget their
allegiance.  
KHRISONG: Lock them up.

**[Mountainside]**

JAMIE: Hey, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: What is it?  
JAMIE: It's started again. The signal's started.  
DOCTOR: Oh no. No, that's another sort of signal.  
(Further down, Songsten's Yeti turn and start back up.)  
DOCTOR: Jamie, I've just picked up another signal.  
JAMIE: Oh, Doctor, let's get to the monastery. You said you'd do all your
tracking from there.  
DOCTOR: Jamie, you don't seem to understand.  
JAMIE: Oh, don't I though? While you're fiddling with that thing, this sphere
is calling up all the Yeti in creation.  
DOCTOR: What a perfect opportunity to trace the main transmitter.  
JAMIE: Aye, and a perfect opportunity to get ourselves killed.

**[Cell]**

VICTORIA: I wish the Doctor would come back.  
THOMNI: This Doctor, is he your guardian?  
VICTORIA: I suppose he is in a way.  
THOMNI: He is a good man.  
VICTORIA: I think so.  
THOMNI: Tell me, Miss Victoria, how did he come by our holy bell?  
VICTORIA: I don't really know. Why?  
THOMNI: It disappeared three hundred years ago.  
VICTORIA: Oh, stolen, you mean?  
THOMNI: No, it was given to a stranger, for safe keeping during a time of
trouble. It was never returned.  
VICTORIA: A stranger? Of course, the Doctor. They're one and the same man.  
THOMNI: But three hundred years?  
VICTORIA: Oh, dear. Well, I know this sounds silly, but the Doctor can travel
through time and space. He has a machine, you see, and, well, I don't really
understand it myself. It's rather difficult to explain.  
THOMNI: There is no need. I understand perfectly.  
VICTORIA: You do?  
THOMNI: Yes. You see, it is said that our Master, Padmasambhava, can free
himself from his earthly body and travel great distances.  
VICTORIA: Oh.  
THOMNI: But this can only be obtained after many years of strict discipline
and self training.  
VICTORIA: You mean, you mean that you might be able to do that sort of thing?  
THOMNI: Perhaps, one day.

**[Courtyard]**

KHRISONG: Rinchen, where is Songsten?  
RINCHEN: No one has seen him for many hours. He will be with Padmasambhava.  
KHRISONG: Padmasambhava.  
SAPAN: To seek guidance.  
KHRISONG: Or is it to escape his responsibilities?  
SAPAN: Khrisong, you should not say such things.  
KHRISONG: Why not? Has anyone seen Padmasambhava? Ralpachan. Inform me when
the Doctor returns.  
SAPAN: Khrisong would be wise not to voice such thoughts.  
RINCHEN: Perhaps, but brave men are impatient. And he is no fool.  
(The lamas go into the buildings. There is a knock at the wicket gate.
Ralpachan opens it and Songsten enters, and hypnotises the guard.)  
SONGSTEN: Sleep, Ralpachan. You have not seen me. You have not opened the
gate. No one has entered. When I leave the courtyard, you will not know that
you have slept.

**[Inner Sanctum]**

PADMASAMBHAVA: You have done well, Songsten. Already the Great Intelligence
begins to take on material form. But it demands more. It must expand. That is
why you and our brothers must depart from this place.  
SONGSTEN: Leave the monastery, Master? I understand. And the strangers?  
PADMASAMBHAVA: The strangers? Oh, yes. I will tell you how to deal with them,
if they return.

**[Mountainside]**

JAMIE: I wish this thing would keep quiet.  
DOCTOR: Not much further.  
(A Yeti blocks their path.)  
DOCTOR: Well, we were expecting it.  
JAMIE: Now what do we do?  
(There are others behind and around them.)  
JAMIE: Trapped!  
DOCTOR: Jamie, give me the sphere. Give me the box.  
JAMIE: What now?  
DOCTOR: Move forward very slowly. Jamie, when I say run, run. Run like the
wind. Don't worry about me.  
JAMIE: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Now, Jamie, please. No heroics, Jamie.  
JAMIE: But surely, Doctor  
DOCTOR: Now Jamie. Run. Run! I know what I'm doing. I hope.  
(Leaving the sphere, Jamie runs past the Yeti. The Doctor rolls the sphere
away from him and the Yeti all follow it.)  
DOCTOR: It worked.

**[Cell]**

(Victoria is pacing.)  
THOMNI: It's no use, Miss Victoria. Even if Padmasambhava would consent to see
us, we can't get out.  
VICTORIA: Can't? We haven't even tried.  
(Ralpachan enters with a tray of food and drink.)  
THOMNI: Thank you, Ralpachan.  
RALPACHAN: I am sorry about this, Thomni.  
VICTORIA: Oh, good. I am thirsty.  
(Victoria takes a long drink.)  
VICTORIA: Ugh. A funny taste. Oh, Ralpachan, has the Doctor? Oh!  
THOMNI: Miss Victoria, what is it?  
VICTORIA: No, no, no, don't touch it. The drink.  
THOMNI: Miss Victoria!  
(Victoria collapses and the men place her on the bed.)  
RALPACHAN: I will fetch some water. Stay close to her, Thomni.  
(Ralpachan leaves.)  
THOMNI: Miss Victoria?  
(Thomni turns to the window. Victoria stands up.)  
THOMNI: Miss Victoria.  
VICTORIA: I'm sorry, Thomni.  
(Victoria runs out of the cell, shutting the door behind her.)  
THOMNI: Miss Victoria!

**[Meeting room]**

(A full chapter meeting is taking place.)  
SONGSTEN: And in his wisdom our Master, Padmasambhava, has given me his
guidance. We must all leave the monastery. It is impossible for us to defeat
the Yeti.  
KHRISONG: But there may be a way. The Doctor  
SONGSTEN: No, my son, they are invincible. They will destroy us all.
Therefore, in order to avoid further bloodshed, it has been decided  
(A guard whispers to Khrisong.)  
KHRISONG: Songsten, I have just been informed that the Doctor has returned. He
brings with him equipment which will help us to defeat these monsters.  
SONGSTEN: Khrisong, the Master has  
KHRISONG: The Master? My apologies, Abbot. I have felt the strength of these
Yeti, but still I will not meekly turn away. I mean to fight.  
(Khrisong leaves.)  
SONGSTEN: Brothers, Khrisong thinks only of our safety, we know, but in this
matter he has been led astray. He has forgotten his vow of obedience.  
(Ralpachan enters.)  
SONGSTEN: In due time he will realise his  
RAPALCHAN: Master Abbot, the girl has escaped. She tricked us by feigning
sickness.  
RINCHEN: She is a devil women.  
SAPAN: She must be found.  
SONGSTEN: Find her, my brothers.

**[Courtyard]**

KHRISONG: We had no defence against it, yet it just walked through the gates.
Doctor, we must act quickly or the Abbot will prevent us.  
JAMIE: Yes, but is Victoria all right?  
KHRISONG: I did as you asked. She is locked up. Is this your equipment?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
(There is a knocking at the gate.)  
KHRISONG: Stand aside.  
(Khrisong opens the wicket gate.)  
DOCTOR: Travers!  
TRAVERS: Thank heavens. Doctor. Up there. A pyramid.  
JAMIE: What's he saying?  
DOCTOR: Shh. Go on.  
TRAVERS: A pyramid. It's a  
(Travers faints. Rinchen enters.)  
RINCHEN: Seize them. Seize the strangers. Khrisong, the girl has escaped. She
is a devil woman.  
JAMIE: Victoria? Hey, what's happened?  
RINCHEN: Take these people to the cells.  
KHRISONG: No! These people can help us. Besides, this man is ill. I cannot
allow it.  
(Songsten stands by the Buddha.)  
SONGSTEN: Khrisong, you will obey. Take them.  
JAMIE: No, but  
DOCTOR: Where is Victoria?  
JAMIE: Doctor, what did he mean 'a devil woman'?  
DOCTOR: What is this about Victoria? Where is she? Where are you taking us?  
(The Doctor, Jamie and Travers are taken away.)  
KHRISONG: I cannot allow this.  
SONGSTEN: You cannot allow? These are the orders of our Master. You must obey.  
KHRISONG: But these people can help us.  
SONGSTEN: The Master tells us there is no help against the Yeti. He tells us
to leave.  
KHRISONG: We will not leave.  
SONGSTEN: Khrisong, do not defy me. Find the girl. Instruct your warriors.  
(Khrisong signals his warriors and they begin the search.)  
SONGSTEN: Go after them, Sapan.  
(When Songsten is alone.)  
SONGSTEN: Advise me Padmasambhava. Khrisong turns his warriors away from the
path of obedience.  
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: I hear, Songsten, and I understand. Well, if they will not
be lead then they must be driven from the monastery. This is what you must do.  
SONGSTEN: I understand, Master.  
(Songsten goes to the gate sentry, Khedru.)  
SONGSTEN: Help them search for the girl. Go quickly.  
(Khedru leaves, and Songsten opens the main gates.)

**[Sanctum]**

(In the inner sanctum, four Yeti models are placed immediately outside the
model monastery gates. Meanwhile, Victoria is in the outer room.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: Come in, my child.  
(The doors to the inner sanctum open. Victoria sees the ancient Master.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Come in. You have no alternative.

__**Episode Five**__

**[Inner sanctum]**

(Victoria enters.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Do not be afraid.  
VICTORIA: Are, are you?  
PADMASAMBHAVA: I am Padmasambhava.  
VICTORIA: I'm sorry to intrude. I know this room's meant to be private, but  
PADMASAMBHAVA: You need my help. Is that not so?  
VICTORIA: Oh yes. Please, the Doctor.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: One moment, child.  
VICTORIA: But.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Shh.  
VICTORIA: What is it?  
PADMASAMBHAVA: The courtyard is empty.  
VICTORIA: Courtyard?  
PADMASAMBHAVA: I must do what I am compelled to do.  
VICTORIA: What's that?  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Come closer.  
(Padmasambhava picks up a model Yeti and shows it to Victoria.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Look. See?  
VICTORIA: It's one of those horrible creatures. A Yeti.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Indeed.  
VICTORIA: But how  
PADMASAMBHAVA: You have not seen it.  
(He passes his hand in front of Victoria's eyes and puts her into a trance.
Padmasambhava puts four model Yeti inside the monastery courtyard. Four life-
size ones walk into the courtyard and split up.)

**[Cell]**

(The Doctor is tending to Travers.)  
JAMIE: She must have had some reason. I mean, why would she run off like that?  
THOMNI: Her motives were not clear to me, Mister Jamie.  
JAMIE: Oh headstrong, that's what she is.  
TRAVERS: No! No! No!  
DOCTOR: All right, Travers. You're quite safe.  
TRAVERS: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
TRAVERS: What happened? Oh, my head.  
DOCTOR: Just relax. You're safe, in the monastery.  
TRAVERS: The monastery?  
DOCTOR: What happened? Where did you go to?  
JAMIE: Was it the Yeti?  
TRAVERS: No, no, not the Yeti. It was something else. It was a light, a
blinding white light and a noise. A piercing noise that went right through my
head. I couldn't stand it. Then I can't remember anymore.  
THOMNI: You spoke of a pyramid.  
TRAVERS: Pyramid?  
THOMNI: Yes, at the gates when you returned.  
TRAVERS: Pyramid? No, no. I left the monastery, then er, then. It's no use, my
mind's a complete blank.  
DOCTOR: You just rest.  
(Travers gasps.)  
DOCTOR: What is it?  
TRAVERS: No!  
THOMNI: We are taught that it is better to share a memory of fear.  
TRAVERS: Evil. A feeling of evil. Like a shadow on my mind.  
DOCTOR: Yes?  
TRAVERS: I felt as though I was going to drown.  
JAMIE: But where did this happen?  
TRAVERS: I, I don't know, I can't remember. Oh, I'm tired, so tired.  
DOCTOR: You just rest. You'll feel better. Poor fellow, he's completely
exhausted.  
JAMIE: What does he mean, a shadow?  
DOCTOR: We'll just let him sleep.  
THOMNI: What could it be, this evil of which he speaks?  
(There is the sound of falling masonry.)  
JAMIE: What was that?  
MONKS [OC]: The Yeti! The Yeti!  
JAMIE: Khrisong, what's happening?  
KHRISONG: The Yeti have broken in. You are safe here.  
JAMIE: But Victoria, where is she?  
RINCHEN: Who can tell? But she will be found. She must be stopped.  
(The Doctor checks his tracking device.)  
JAMIE: Doctor, is there nothing we can do?  
DOCTOR: Shush.

**[Meeting room]**

(The monks and lamas barricade themselves in.)  
SONGSTEN: Calm.  
KHRISONG: Forgive me, Songsten. I have failed to defend the monastery.  
SONGSTEN: Failed? No. This disaster was written. Man cannot alter his destiny.  
KHRISONG: I should have obeyed you, my Abbot. My desire to fight these
creatures was foolish, but I will defend you with my life.  
SAPAN: Abbot, I fear for Rinchen's safety.  
SONGSTEN: Is he not here?  
SAPAN: No. He would not seek safety. He is so sure that the girl is
responsible.  
KHRISONG: He is still searching for her?  
SAPAN: Yes.  
SONGSTEN: Find her.  
KHRISONG: If it is not too late.  
RALPACHAN: The Yeti. They are turning back.  
KHRISONG: Then you are safe for the moment. Ralpachan, come with me.

**[Courtyard]**

(Rinchen watches as two Yeti wreck the cloisters.)  
RINCHEN: Stop! Stop! She-devil, wherever you are, call off these monsters.
Spare us.  
(The other two Yeti rock the Buddha statue.)  
RINCHEN: Oh, no! Oh, no!  
(The statue falls on Rinchen, killing him. The four Yeti leave through the
main gates and go back up the mountain.)  
KHRISONG: He's dead.  
RALPACHAN: The monastery of Detsen is accursed.

**[Inner sanctum]**

(Padmasambhava removes the models from the monastery. Victoria is still in a
trance.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Now it is complete. Now the monks will leave. By nightfall the
monastery will be emptied. The mountain yours. Will this then be your final
command? Will you then be content? I do not understand, but I will continue to
serve.  
(He turns to Victoria.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA: And now we must consider the problem of you and your friends.
The Doctor is not easily frightened like my poor monks. Therefore, my child,
you will assist me. Together we will make sure that he leaves. Come closer.
This is what you will do.

**[Cell]**

(Thomni has chalked a plan of the monastery on a wall.)  
THOMNI: This is the courtyard and we are here, to the south.  
DOCTOR: I see, Thomni. So here lies north.  
THOMNI: That is so.  
DOCTOR: What are those readings again, Jamie? Jamie, the readings?  
JAMIE: What? What?  
DOCTOR: The readings?  
JAMIE: I'm sorry, I was thinking of Victoria.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, but there's nothing we can do about her.  
JAMIE: Two ninety seven, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Two ninety seven. Now that will give us a bearing roughly there.  
THOMNI: Does your science help us, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: No. We want another bearing, say, from there. And where those two
cross, that will be where the transmissions are coming from. But that won't
tell us why.  
THOMNI: Why?  
DOCTOR: Yes, what is the purpose behind all this. That's what we have to find
out, ay Jamie?  
TRAVERS: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Are you feeling better?  
TRAVERS: Better? What are we doing in here? What's happened?  
DOCTOR: You had a spot of trouble on the mountain.  
TRAVERS: Trouble?  
JAMIE: Aye, with the Yeti no doubt.  
TRAVERS: Funny, I don't remember. Sorry, I'm a bit confused.  
JAMIE: Well you sounded it, with all that talk about.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure it'll all come back to you in time.  
TRAVERS: Yes, with the headache I've got, no wonder I can't remember anything.
I think I'll get a bit of fresh air. Why is this door locked?

**[Courtyard]**

SONGSTEN: Do not blame yourself, Khrisong. Death is inevitable. Sambhutar,
Ghentan, take up our brother. We will take him with us on our journey. There
will be a time to mourn our brother.  
KHRISONG: Put to the test I ran and hid like a mountain rabbit. I'm not fit to
be called a warrior. We must lead out our brothers before more of them are
destroyed.  
SONGSTEN: Gather what is needed, my brothers. Soon it will be the hour for
meditation, then we must depart.  
KHRISONG: What of the strangers, master Abbott?  
SONGSTEN: They will be taken with us to a place of safety.  
SAPAN: But the girl is lost.  
SONGSTEN: Khrisong and his warriors will find her.  
KHRISONG: And the Master? What of Padmasambhava?  
SONGSTEN: His powers are great. He will remain.  
(Some of the monks are on their knees. Victoria enters in a trance, carrying
the holy ghanta.)  
SONGSTEN: The holy Ghanta.  
KHRISONG: Child, how came you  
SAPAN: Shh. She has entered the Sanctum.  
KHRISONG: Then let me.  
SONGSTEN: Silence. See, she is about to speak.  
(Victoria's mouth opens, but another voice comes out.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: This is a time of much danger.  
SONGSTEN: Padmasambhava.  
(All the monks kneel.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: I have chosen to speak to you myself through the lips of
this maiden. She bears the holy Ghanta. Bear it away to safe keeping. Treat
this child with kindness. She and the strangers are innocent of any malice
towards you. Their wish is but to help you against the Yeti. But in my wisdom
I tell you, there is no help. Detsen must be abandoned. When the wind destroys
the nest, so the bird will build another.  
SONGSTEN: But what of you, Master.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Go, with my blessing.  
SONGSTEN: But, Master.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Do not question. I will remain here to the end.  
SAPAN: Will a day come for our return to Detsen?  
(Victoria sways, and Khrisong catches her. Songsten takes the Ghanta.)  
SONGSTEN: Take her to rest. Ralpachan, release the strangers. Bid them make
ready. It is time for prayer. The last time at Detsen. Come, my brothers.

**[Cell]**

RALPACHAN: You are released.  
TRAVERS: I should jolly well think so. What the devil do you think you're up
to.  
RALPACHAN: You must prepare to leave with us.  
TRAVERS: I shall have a few words to say to the Abbot before I go anywhere.  
JAMIE: Never mind about that. Have you found Victoria yet?  
RALPACHAN: She is safe. Khrisong is with her.  
JAMIE: Ah, good.

**[Meeting room]**

(Khrisong brings in Victoria.)  
KHRISONG: Are you recovered? Child?  
JAMIE: There you are, I've been worried sick. Where have you been? Victoria?
What have you done to her? Doctor? Doctor, I think she's ill.  
DOCTOR: Let me see.  
VICTORIA: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Yes, Victoria.  
VICTORIA: There is great danger. You must take me away. Take me away. Take me
away!  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes of course.  
JAMIE: Victoria, what's happened? Tell us? What's the matter with her?
Victoria, it's me, Jamie.  
DOCTOR: How long has she been like this?  
VICTORIA: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Yes, Victoria.  
VICTORIA: There is great danger. You must take me away. Take me away. Take me
away!  
KHRISONG: The child is still in a state of trance.  
DOCTOR: Still? What do you mean?  
KHRISONG: She spoke to us with the voice of the Master.  
THOMNI: Ah. Then she did reach the holy sanctum.  
JAMIE: What are you talking about?  
THOMNI: She was certain that Padmasambhava would recognise the Doctor.  
JAMIE: Recognise the Doctor?  
THOMNI: Yes, he has been here before.  
DOCTOR: But that was three hundred years ago. It's the same man.  
RALPACHAN: Khrisong, the Abbot Songsten wishes us to join our brothers in
prayer.  
KHRISONG: Very well. You will prepare to leave. Is Mister Travers ready?  
RALPACHAN: He is in the courtyard.  
KHRISONG: Come, Thomni, to prayer.  
THOMNI: Khrisong, will you forgive me?  
KHRISONG: We have both of us strayed from the path of obedience.  
(The monks leave.)  
DOCTOR: (sotto) Jamie, there is something I have to do.  
JAMIE: Right. Hey, why are we whispering?  
DOCTOR: It's my voice. She reacts to my voice.  
JAMIE: Oh, it's that hypnotism thing. Can you not do anything about it?  
DOCTOR: Yes I can, but I need more information. Now, you wait here.  
JAMIE: Where are you going?  
DOCTOR: I'm going to see a very old friend.

**[Inner sanctum]**

(There is a cloth over the model on the table.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Oh, Intelligence. You promised to release me, yet still I feel
your grasp upon this frail body. Why? What is happening? This was not your
plan. But if you continue to expand? I have brought the world to its end.  
(In the cave the gunk is still coming from the pyramid, filling the chamber
and the tunnel, and approaching the cave mouth.)  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Come in, Doctor. Good to look upon your face again. So many
years.  
DOCTOR: Padmasambhava. So it's true.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: I have been kept alive so many years, but now our time left is
very, very short. Listen carefully. Perhaps you can  
DOCTOR: Kept alive? I don't understand.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: I didn't know. I didn't realise.  
DOCTOR: What? Try to tell me.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Intelligence. Formless in space. I astral travelled.  
DOCTOR: I see. You made mental contact with this intelligence?  
PADMASAMBHAVA: It used my mind. It controls my body.  
DOCTOR: But why?  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Experiment. Wished material form. A voice, it said. I believed.
Experiment. But now. Help. You must help me.  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I will help you. But first you must tell me things. Why
are the monks being driven away? What is the purpose of these robots, the
Yeti? Where is their control? Padmasambhava? Padmasambhava?  
(The old man's head has slumped forward. The Doctor listens for a heartbeat,
then leaves the room. Then the eyes open and glare after him.)

**[Meeting room]**

JAMIE: I wish there was something I could do.  
(Jamie goes behind Victoria, picks up a broken stool and throws it to the
floor. She doesn't even twitch.)  
DOCTOR: What on earth was that?  
JAMIE: Oh, it was just an idea.  
VICTORIA: Doctor. There is great danger. You must take me away. Take me away.
Take me away!  
JAMIE: Doctor, you've got to do something. Did you find out what you wanted to
know?  
DOCTOR: Not about Victoria, no. But I found some very interesting clues as to
what's been happening.  
JAMIE: Oh, never mind about that. It's Victoria you ought to be worrying
about.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, you're quite right. Victoria must come first. Trouble is I
really need more information. However, I'll just have to take a chance. It may
just be simple post-hypnotic suggestion. On the other hand.  
JAMIE: Yes.  
DOCTOR: It may be something worse.  
JAMIE: What if it is?  
DOCTOR: Well, let's just hope it isn't.  
(The Doctor takes Victoria's face in his hands.)  
DOCTOR: Victoria.  
VICTORIA: Doctor. There is great danger. You must take me away.  
DOCTOR: Yes, Victoria.  
VICTORIA: Take me away.  
DOCTOR: Listen to me. You've been taken away. You're no longer in the
monastery. You're safe in the Tardis. Now do you understand? You're safe. In
the Tardis. Yes. Well, look at me. Look at my eyes. You're feeling tired, very
sleepy. Drift away. Let yourself drift away into sleep. Deeper. Deeper. Sleep.
Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Oh, not you Jamie.  
JAMIE: Hey, what?  
DOCTOR: So far, so good.  
JAMIE: Hey, I never knew you could do that sort of thing.  
DOCTOR: No. Neither did the person who hypnotised Victoria.  
JAMIE: What now?  
DOCTOR: Well, I'm tempted to ask her what happened, but I don't think I dare
probe too deeply. The important thing is to get rid of this implanted fear.
It's growing every minute.  
JAMIE: What if you can't?  
DOCTOR: Well, we shall just have to do as she asks and take her away. If we
don't.  
JAMIE: Yes.  
DOCTOR: She'll go out of her mind.  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: Well, that's the object of the exercise. To get us away from the
monastery. But I'm not beaten that easily.  
JAMIE: Hey, you're taking an awful risk.  
DOCTOR: I know what I'm doing, Jamie. Victoria? Now, Victoria, you can hear my
voice, can't you?  
VICTORIA: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Oh, good. Now I'm going to take you a little way back in the past,
Victoria. You're in the cell with Thomni. Do you understand?  
VICTORIA: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Good. Now you're going to forget everything after that. You went to
sleep. Is that clear? Good. Jamie and I have come back to the monastery and
you are in the meeting room with us. You're feeling happy, but a little tired.
Do you understand?  
VICTORIA: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Good. Now, when I count three, you're going to wake up. One, two,
three.  
VICTORIA: (yawning) Oh, oh dear. Oh, I must have dropped off.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe you did. I've got work to do.  
VICTORIA: What are you grinning at?

**[Courtyard]**

(Travers is by the gates.)  
DOCTOR: Travers? Travers.  
TRAVERS: Yes, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: How are you feeling?  
TRAVERS: Oh, much better thanks. Look, I've been taking a look up the
mountain. Those robots are still there. They're just standing, not moving. I
don't like it.  
DOCTOR: Yes. I think things are coming to a head.  
TRAVERS: What are they up to? What are they waiting for?  
DOCTOR: Instructions. Travers, can you remember any more of what happened to
you on the mountain?  
TRAVERS: I'm afraid not. My mind's a complete blank.  
DOCTOR: Are you prepared to risk it again?  
TRAVERS: I thought we're supposed to clear out.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the monks are, but I want to get back up the mountain. One
more bearing and I shall know where the control centre is.  
TRAVERS: I see. You want me to help you.  
DOCTOR: Yes, if you will.  
TRAVERS: What about your young friends?  
DOCTOR: Oh, they're leaving with the monks, but I want to get out of here
before anyone sees us. Will you help?  
TRAVERS: All right, I'm on.  
DOCTOR: Oh, good.

**[Mountainside]**

(The Doctor and Travers find two motionless Yeti. They hide behind a rock and
the Doctor checks his tracking device.)  
DOCTOR: What's the matter?  
TRAVERS: I don't know. I've got a feeling I've done this before. Now, what do
you want me to do?  
DOCTOR: I want you to stay here and take some readings. Those Yeti are not
transmitting. I'm going over there to stir things up a bit.  
TRAVERS: I don't understand that thing. You'd better let me go.  
DOCTOR: Oh no, it's far too dangerous. I can't ask you to take that sort of
risk.  
TRAVERS: Rot. I can take care of myself. Right. Now, wish me luck.  
DOCTOR: No, wait!  
(The Yeti move away.)  
DOCTOR: That's odd.  
TRAVERS: You got your readings Because if you've got the reading.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
TRAVERS: What's up?

**[Courtyard]**

KHRISONG: Is there any sign?  
RALPACHAN: No. Every room is empty.  
THOMNI: Mister Travers and the Doctor are nowhere to be found.  
KHRISONG: It as you wished. The monastery is deserted.  
SONGSTEN: This is well. I will ask a final blessing of our Master,
Padmasambhava, then we will depart.  
VICTORIA: Padmasambhava!  
JAMIE: Try not to think about it.  
VICTORIA: But I think  
JAMIE: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Khrisong, I have found the control.  
KHRISONG: It is too late, Doctor, I can no longer help you.  
DOCTOR: But you don't understand. It's here, in the monastery.  
TRAVERS: What? That's impossible.  
THOMNI: But the monastery is empty. We are all here.  
DOCTOR: Are we? Are we all here?  
THOMNI: The Master!  
SAPAN: Songsten is with him.  
KHRISONG: Then he is in great danger. Stay where you are, all of you.  
TRAVERS: Songsten. I remember. Songsten, the Yeti, on the mountain. Yes, yes,
it's all coming back to me.  
JAMIE: Well, tell us.  
TRAVERS: There was this cave.

**[Cave]**

(And the corporeal form of the Intelligence is spilling from the cave onto the
mountainside.)

__**Episode Six**__

**[Courtyard]**

DOCTOR: It was Songsten who took this pyramid into the cave?  
TRAVERS: That's right.  
JAMIE: And the Yeti never harmed him?  
TRAVERS: No.  
DOCTOR: Songsten. He's the link I've been looking for.  
THOMNI: But Khrisong is with Songsten now.  
DOCTOR: Then he's in danger.

**[Sanctum]**

(Songsten is praying when Khrisong rushes in.)  
KHRISONG: Songsten! Danger. You are in great danger. Come away from this
place.  
SONGSTEN: What madness is this?  
VOICE [OC]: Khrisong, whence came you by such foolish thoughts?  
KHRISONG: Don't try and frighten me. Who are you? I demand to know what is
happening.  
SONGSTEN: Demand? You are in the presence of the Master.  
KHRISONG: Yes, a master who controls the Yeti. What is hidden in there?  
SONGSTEN: Forgive him, Master.  
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: Of course. But our brother must not be allowed to depart
in the knowledge that I am other than what I am.  
VOICE [OC]: Songsten!  
KHRISONG: Why do you put him in a trance?  
VOICE [OC]: You understand, Songsten?  
SONGSTEN: I understand, Master.  
PADMASAMBHAVA [OC]: You may enter, Khrisong.  
SONGSTEN: One moment. You may not take weapons into the presence of the
Master.  
VOICE [OC]: Are you afraid?  
(Khrisong gives his sword to Songsten and turns to the inner doors. Songsten
stabs him.)

**[Inner sanctum]**

(Padmasambhava's face shows the battle for control of his mind.)  
VOICE: You have done well, Songsten. You will now.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: Why are you making me do this? Why? Release me, I beg of you. I
am.  
VOICE: Songsten, you will now go forth with the monks. You will never return.

**[Sanctum]**

(During this, the door to the Inner Sanctum close again.)  
SONGSTEN: Yes, Master.  
JAMIE [OC]: Khrisong, where are you?  
THOMNI: Khrisong! What has happened?  
JAMIE: Khrisong.  
TRAVERS: We're too late.  
SONGSTEN: What have you done to Khrisong?  
TRAVERS: What have we done? Well, that's a bit cool, I must say.  
THOMNI: You have killed him.  
SONGSTEN: I?  
VOICE [OC]: Songsten, kill them!  
DOCTOR: Jamie, grab hold of him. His hands.  
(They overpower the Abbot and lead him away.)  
DOCTOR: Quick, get him out of here.  
KHRISONG: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: It's all right. Lie still. I'll get help.  
KHRISONG: Too late. My time has come. Closer. My brothers, they are not to
blame Songsten. He was in a trance.  
DOCTOR: I understand. Now just try and  
KHRISONG: No. Leave. Leave me here.  
(Khrisong dies. When the room is empty, the demented laughter of the possessed
Master rings out.)

**[Courtyard]**

THOMNI: My brothers. My brothers, Khrisong is dead.  
SAPAN: Dead?  
RALPACHAN: By whose hand?  
THOMNI: By the hand of our Abbot, Songsten.  
SAPAN: This cannot be.  
TRAVERS: Aye, it's true enough.  
SAPAN: No. What reason would he have to do such a vile thing?  
JAMIE: Obviously he thought Khrisong knew too much.  
SAPAN: Songsten, is this true?  
(Ralpachan raises his weapon with a cry.)  
JAMIE: Keep back!  
RALPACHAN: Do not interfere, stranger.  
THOMNI: No, leave him alone. There's been enough killing.  
VICTORIA: Jamie, no!  
THOMNI: Wait! Wait, my brothers. This is no time for rashness.  
DOCTOR: He is quite right. He is quite right. You listen to him.  
RALPACHAN: Well?  
SONGSTEN: Kill them. Kill them. Kill them.  
THOMNI: Look, is this our Abbot who loves peace? Surely you can see he was
made to kill Khrisong. He is a helpless puppet.  
TRAVERS: But I saw him on the mountain. He was leading the Yeti.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but by command, unknowingly. Thomni is right. Songsten is merely
a puppet.  
SAPAN: Who has done this to him?  
RALPACHAN: Is it you?  
THOMNI: No. I tell you I saw Songsten change. He was put in a trance by the
Master.  
SAPAN: Have a care what you say.  
DOCTOR: Now listen to me, all of you. Your Abbot is not responsible. But
neither is Padmasambhava. He too is controlled. Now do as you'd planned. Leave
the monastery. There is great evil here.  
TRAVERS: No, Doctor, you're wrong. The evil is on the mountains. It's that
hideous thing in the cave.  
SAPAN: Wherever it may be, what can we do to overcome such a force? My
brothers, let us obey the Doctor.  
THOMNI: What of you, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I will stay here, Thomni.  
JAMIE: Oh, me too.  
VICTORIA: Why?  
DOCTOR: I have to. This things that's here, this evil, it will spread. It has
to be stopped and I think I can do it. Thomni, will you help me? It will be
dangerous.  
THOMNI: You can rid us of this evil?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can. And if we succeed, the monks will be able to
return.  
THOMNI: Then of course I will help.  
VICTORIA: Doctor, you're not going to send me away with the monks, are you?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Victoria. I think it best.  
VICTORIA: Well, I won't go.  
DOCTOR: No, I didn't think you would.  
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor. Songsten, he's unconscious.  
RALPACHAN: Sapan, tend our Abbot.  
DOCTOR: No. Wait. There are things I have to find out and only Songsten can
tell me.  
JAMIE: What makes you so sure he's going to do that?  
DOCTOR: Sit him down here, Jamie. Over there.  
(Travers and Ralpachan are talking by the gate.)  
TRAVERS: The Doctor's got it wrong. I've seen that thing in the cave. That's
what we've got to destroy.  
RALPACHAN: The Doctor thinks the evil is here, in  
TRAVERS: I know, I've seen it. He hasn't. He said himself that Padmasambhava
was being controlled. And it's that thing that was doing it. I'm going to get
at it. Are you coming with me?  
RALPACHAN: Very well.  
TRAVERS: Good man, come on.  
RALPACHAN: What do you plan to do?  
TRAVERS: I don't quite know yet. Got to get to that cave. The pyramid's the
answer. I just have to take a shot at it with this. Come on.  
(Rifle in hand, Travers leads Ralpachan out to the mountainside. In the cave,
the Intelligence continues to come from the pyramid. The Doctor has hypnotised
Songsten.)  
DOCTOR: And the Yeti?  
SONGSTEN: They were designed to serve the Intelligence.  
DOCTOR: I see. Now, this Intelligence, it is confined to the cave?  
SONGSTEN: No.  
DOCTOR: No?  
SONGSTEN: It has broken its promise. Now it demands the whole mountain.  
DOCTOR: I see. Now, Songsten, I want you to help me.  
SONGSTEN: I want to help you.  
DOCTOR: Now these Yeti, they are controlled?  
SONGSTEN: Yes, by Padmasambhava.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but the control units, they were made somehow, somewhere?  
SONGSTEN: The Master laboured for nearly two hundred years. With the help of
the Intelligence, he built the creatures and the other wonderful machines.  
DOCTOR: These small Yeti models. Their movements must be mirrored by the real
robots?  
SONGSTEN: True.  
DOCTOR: But there must be a control. A machine that gives out the orders. Now,
where is that control?  
SONGSTEN: The sanctum.  
DOCTOR: But I have seen the sanctum.  
SONGSTEN: Throne. Behind the throne there lies a hidden room.  
DOCTOR: How do I get into it? Songsten, how do I get into it?  
(The model is uncovered and two Yeti are being sent to the monastery.)

**[Mountainside]**

(It is now night. The men hide from two moving Yeti.)  
TRAVERS: That was a close one. Heading towards the monastery.  
RALPACHAN: Should we not return?  
TRAVERS: No, now we've come this far. Let's push on. Come on.

**[Courtyard]**

DOCTOR: Take care of him, Sapan.  
SAPAN: I will. He has suffered much.  
SONGSTEN: Is it time to leave?  
(Sapan takes Songsten away.)  
DOCTOR: Now, as soon as the monks have left, we must get into that control
room.  
JAMIE: How do we get past Padma-thing-me?  
DOCTOR: I'll deal with him. But remember, as soon as we're in the sanctum,
whatever happens, Thomni and you must smash the controls.  
VICTORIA: What do you mean, whatever happens?  
DOCTOR: Padmasambhava will use super-normal powers if necessary. For a start,
he'll try to hypnotise you again.  
VICTORIA: Well how can I stop him?  
DOCTOR: Thomni, you'd better teach her the Jewel of the Lotus prayer. It'll
give her something to concentrate on.  
THOMNI: Yes, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Jamie, where is Travers?  
JAMIE: Travers?  
DOCTOR: Well, he's not here.  
JAMIE: Perhaps he's deserted us.  
DOCTOR: No, I don't somehow think he's done that, but I'd like to know what
he's up to.

**[Mountainside]**

TRAVERS: Well, we're going the right way. There's some sort of path along
here.  
RALPACHAN: Look.  
(The whole mountaintop is lit up.)  
RALPACHAN: What is it?  
TRAVERS: It's that hideous light from the cave. It's spreading all over the
mountain.  
RALPACHAN: It's blinding me. How can we reach the pyramid?  
TRAVERS: We can't. It's too late for that now, I'm afraid.  
RALPACHAN: But it will engulf the monastery.

**[Courtyard]**

SAPAN: Doctor, why will you not accept the aid of our warrior brothers?  
DOCTOR: Because they're needed to guard you and the lamas, Sapan.  
THOMNI: Besides brave hearts will not suffice for this battle.  
SAPAN: Protect them, Thomni. We shall pray for you.  
DOCTOR: Thank you. Don't worry, everything will be all right. When it's all
over you can come back. I hope.  
(The monks parade out, chanting. When they have left, four Yeti take up
position outside the monastery gates.)  
DOCTOR: Now don't forget. I will go into the sanctum first and deal with
Padmasambhava. And, as soon as it's safe, make for the curtain behind the
throne. That's where the control room is.  
THOMNI: But when we have destroyed the machine, what'll happen?  
DOCTOR: I haven't the faintest idea.  
JAMIE: What?  
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Jamie. It's going to be all right.  
JAMIE: Hey, we might all be blown to smithereens.  
VICTORIA: What am I supposed to do?  
DOCTOR: Well nothing, I hope, but one of us just might need help. Are we
ready? Come on.

**[Monastery gate]**

(Travers and Ralpachan return to see the Yeti blocking their way.)  
RALPACHAN: What shall we do?  
TRAVERS: Looks as though we're well and truly cooked.  
RALPACHAN: Look. There below us, torches. The monks must have left.  
TRAVERS: Yes, but has the Doctor?  
RALPACHAN: How can we tell? We are trapped.  
TRAVERS: I don't know.  
RALPACHAN: We cannot enter the monastery.  
TRAVERS: Looks as though we'll just have to sit tight.  
RALPACHAN: Can we not try and join my brothers?  
TRAVERS: No. The Doctor may still be in there. I'm sure he is.

**[Sanctum]**

(Jamie and Thonmi take their positions either side of the inner doors as the
Doctor tries to open them.)  
VOICE [OC]: Why are you here? Why did you not heed my warning? You are
stubborn, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Who are you?  
VOICE [OC]: You know well it is I, the Master, Padmasambhava, who speaks.  
DOCTOR: Oh no, it isn't. I know Padmasambhava. He's my friend. Where have you
come from? Why are you using his body in this fashion?  
VOICE [OC]: Such a brain as yours is too small to grasp my purpose.  
DOCTOR: Too small?  
VOICE [OC]: I am much power.  
DOCTOR: Much power?  
(One of the incense burners rises into the air.)  
DOCTOR: Just a simple levitation. A childish trick. Now stop playing games and
open these doors. Or are you afraid to meet me face to face?  
VOICE [OC]: You are rash.  
(The inner doors open.)  
DOCTOR: Now, anything can happen now. Just trust me, and above all, don't
panic.  
(The Doctor enters the Inner sanctum, and cries out in pain.)  
VICTORIA: No! No! The Doctor said to wait.

**[Inner Sanctum]**

(The Doctor is bent over, trying to reach the throne. Padmasambhava is in
pain, but the Intelligence still has control. The Doctor struggles to stand,
and a wind howls through the room. The supporting frame is torn down.)  
DOCTOR: Now!  
JAMIE [OC]: Come on, Thomni.  
(Jamie and Thomni are stopped by the Intelligence. The Doctor locks minds with
it, and Jamie and Thomni can move again.)  
DOCTOR: Quickly. Into the control room. Smash the controls.  
JAMIE: To work, Thomni.  
(They smash panels and rip out wiring. There is a metal pyramid on an altar,
about two feet high. Opposite it is a large sphere. Padmasambhava reaches for
the model.)  
VICTORIA: Doctor, he's bringing the Yeti in!  
(The hand brings the Yeti into the monastery.)  
DOCTOR: Victoria, Victoria, I can't hold him. The models. Knock over the
models! No, Victoria, don't let him. Jewel of the Lotus. Om mane padme hum. Om
mane padme hum.  
VICTORIA: Om mane padme hum. Om mane padme hum.  
(But she was completely unable to move.)

**[Monastery gate]**

(The Yeti enter the courtyard.)  
TRAVERS: At last. Come on.

**[Inner sanctum]**

VICTORIA: Om mane padme hum. Oh, it's no good. I can't move.  
DOCTOR: You've got to.  
VICTORIA: I can't!  
DOCTOR: Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Yeti's coming!

**[Control room]**

JAMIE: Yeti?  
THOMNI: But we have destroyed the machines.  
JAMIE: Well there must something else that controls them. The control unit. Of
course, the sphere.

**[Inner sanctum]**

(The Yeti enter. Jamie smashes the sphere. There is a flash of light. The
robot's chest units explode and they collapse.)  
VOICE [OC]: One stroke of fortune will not save you.  
(Travers and Ralpachan enter. Travers shoots at the old man, who catches the
bullets in his hand.)  
VOICE [OC]: Stupid man. Did you not feel enough of my power when you met me in
the cave?  
TRAVERS: The cave?  
DOCTOR: The cave. Jamie! There was a pyramid in the cave!

**[Control room]**

JAMIE: There's one here too.

**[Inner sanctum]**

DOCTOR: Destroy it!  
VOICE [OC]: No!  
(Jamie uses Thomni's stave to smash the pyramid and Padmasambhava screams. He
falls from the throne, knocking over the model. Everything shakes as something
in the distance explodes. It is the pyramid in the cave, which takes the top
of the mountain with it in the blast.)  
VICTORIA: Look at him.  
PADMASAMBHAVA: At last, peace. Thank you, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Goodbye old friend.  
JAMIE: Are you all right, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. It worked. The Intelligence is destroyed.  
TRAVERS: Yes, well, it was most decidedly tricky for a minute or two.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Thomni, you can signal the monks they can return.  
(Thonmi and Ralpachan leave.)  
TRAVERS: Doctor, are you trying to tell me that that old man was responsible
for all this? The Yeti? The cave?  
DOCTOR: Oh no, no. He was just a tool in the hands of a monstrous brain. It
wasn't his fault.  
VICTORIA: It's horrible. Let's get away from here.  
JAMIE: Aye, come on.  
(The monastery gong rings out.)

**[Courtyard]**

(Dawn. The gong is still sounding as the travellers prepare to depart.)  
THOMNI: Please, Doctor. Our Abbot will be most grieved that he did not thank
you personally. Will you not wait?  
DOCTOR: Ah no, Thomni, we're anxious to get back to the Tar.  
(Jamie coughs.)  
DOCTOR: We're anxious to get back.  
THOMNI: Goodbye, Doctor.  
TRAVERS: I'll see them safely up the mountain.  
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Thomni.  
JAMIE: Goodbye.  
VICTORIA: Bye, Thomni.

**[Mountainside]**

(They find the remains of a Yeti.)  
JAMIE: Aye, well those things won't bother us anymore, Doctor.  
VICTORIA: Those horrible things.  
DOCTOR: Ah, they were clever machines. Almost a pity to have had them
destroyed. Well, at least you'll have something to take home from your
expedition, Mister Travers.  
TRAVERS: I suppose so. But nobody'll believe me. They'd think I'd had it made.
No, I'm afraid the expedition's over now.  
VICTORIA: Oh Doctor, look.  
JAMIE: Oh no.  
DOCTOR: It can't be.  
(A shaggy, bear-like creature is racing towards them. Then it sees them and
runs away again.)  
TRAVERS: A Yeti. A real Yeti! At last! Excuse the haste. Goodbye and all that.
Mustn't lose this one.  
JAMIE: Do you think he'll ever find his abominable snowman, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Well, that we shall never know, Jamie. What's the matter with you? Are
you cold or something?  
JAMIE: Oh it's all right for you in your home made Yeti kit.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose there is a little bit of a nip in the air.  
JAMIE: A nip? A nip? Just look at my knees. They're bright blue.  
DOCTOR: What a horrible sight.  
JAMIE: Could you not land us somewhere warmer next time?  
DOCTOR: Jamie, you never know, do you?  
(The Doctor plays his recorder as they walk up to the Tardis.)
