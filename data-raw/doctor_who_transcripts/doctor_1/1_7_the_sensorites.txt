**The Sensorites**  

Original Airdate: 20 Jun, 1964  

__**Episode One - Strangers In Space**__

**[Tardis]**

IAN: Perhaps we've landed on top of something.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
BARBARA: Or inside something.  
DOCTOR: Hmm? This says everything has stopped, but the ship.  
SUSAN: What did you mean, Barbara, inside something?  
IAN: Perhaps that's why we still appear to be moving.  
BARBARA: Try the scanner, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Covered with static. Let's try it again, Susan.  
(The screen is just streaks of static)  
IAN: That could be caused by an unsuppressed motor.  
DOCTOR: Yes, or a magnetic field.  
SUSAN: Shall we go outside, Grandfather?  
DOCTOR: No, I shan't be happy until I've solved this little mystery.  
BARBARA: I don't know why we ever bother to leave the ship.  
DOCTOR: You're still thinking about the experiences you had with the Aztecs.  
BARBARA: No, I've got over that now.  
IAN: There's one thing about it, Doctor. We're certainly different from when
we started out with you.  
SUSAN: That's funny. Grandfather and I were talking about that just before you
came in. How you've both changed.  
BARBARA: Well we've all changed.  
SUSAN: Have I?  
BARBARA: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Yes, it all started out as a mild curiosity in a junkyard, and now
it's turned out to be quite a, quite a great spirit of adventure, don't you
think?  
IAN: Yes. We've had some pretty rough times and even that doesn't stop us.
It's a wonderful thing, this ship of yours, Doctor. Taken us back to
prehistoric times, the Daleks.  
SUSAN: Marco Polo, Marinus.  
BARBARA: And the Aztecs.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and that extraordinary quarrel I had with that English king,
Henry the Eighth. You know, he threw a parson's nose at me.  
BARBARA: What did you do?  
DOCTOR: Threw it back, of course. Take them to the Tower, he said. That's why
I did it.  
BARBARA: Why?  
SUSAN: The Tardis was inside the Tower.  
DOCTOR: Of course, it was long before you appeared on the scene. However, now,
let us get back to this little problem. Open the door, Susan.  
IAN: Have you checked everything, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Plenty of fresh air, temperature normal.  
BARBARA: Oh, just the unknown, then.  
DOCTOR: Precisely.

**[Control room]**

(They walk out into a room with people in uniform sitting in chairs, very
still)  
IAN: You were right, Barbara. We have landed in something.  
DOCTOR: It's a spaceship. Close the door, Susan. Let us be careful. There's
been some kind of catastrophe here.  
(Ian takes the pulse of one man. He's intact, flexible, but)  
IAN: Dead.  
SUSAN: This one's a girl.  
BARBARA: I'm afraid she's the same. What could have happened? I can't see a
wound or anything.  
IAN: Suffocation, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I never make uninformed guesses, my friend, but certainly that's one
answer. Oh, dear, dear, dear, what a tragedy you know. She's only a few years
older than Susan.  
SUSAN: Grandfather, let's go back to the Tardis.  
DOCTOR: Why?  
SUSAN: I don't know. I've got a feeling about this.  
BARBARA: Yes, I can sense something too.  
IAN: You mean that whatever it was killed them could kill us?  
DOCTOR: Chesterton, have you noticed anything about this watch? (and the
man's) Neither of them are working. These are the non-winding type. A movement
of the wrist recharges the spring inside for twenty four hours.  
IAN: Yes, and they both stopped at about three o'clock.  
DOCTOR: Yes, then suppose we say that they've only just stopped. Now that
would mean that the last movement of their wrists would be at least twenty
four hours ago.  
SUSAN: Grandfather, he's still warm.  
BARBARA: Then they've only just died.  
DOCTOR: It doesn't make sense, does it. But the facts are all here. I think it
would be wise if we returned to the ship and left these people. There's
nothing we can do for them.  
BARBARA: No, we can't even bury them.  
DOCTOR: Come along, open the door, Susan.  
(The man groans and slumps forward over his desk)  
IAN: His heart had stopped beating, Doctor. He was dead.  
MAITLAND: (something)  
IAN: What do you want? Yes?  
MAITLAND: Over there.  
IAN: Where? There?  
MAITLAND: Behind you.  
IAN: Here?  
MAITLAND: No, on the left.  
IAN: What, this? (a metal box)  
MAITLAND: Yes, that.  
(Ian gives it to him, and a heartbeat starts up)  
MAITLAND: Carol. Place this against Carol's chest.  
BARBARA: I'm sorry, Carol's dead.  
MAITLAND: Please, do as I ask.  
(The heartbeat sound and she wakes up)  
IAN: You were both dead.  
SUSAN: Grandfather, what was in that box?  
MAITLAND: It's a heart resuscitator. When you found us, we were in a very long
sleep, but we weren't dead. My name is Maitland. This is Carol Richmond, my
co-astronaut.  
DOCTOR: Tell me, are you from the Earth?  
MAITLAND: Yes.  
BARBARA: So are we. How's it looking?  
CAROL: The Earth, do you mean?  
BARBARA: Yes.  
CAROL: Still too much air traffic.  
IAN: They got it off the roads, did they?  
MAITLAND: You might say that, yes.  
IAN: Barbara and I, we come from London. Tell me, is Big Ben still on time?  
MAITLAND: What century do you come from? The twenty first, perhaps?  
BARBARA: No, the twentieth.  
MAITLAND: I see.  
CAROL: What's Big Ben?  
BARBARA: Well, it's a clock. Near Westminster Abbey.  
MAITLAND: Yes, you see, the whole lower half of England is called Central City
now. There hasn't been a London for four hundred years. We come from the
twenty eighth century.  
CAROL: Captain Maitland, these people must leave immediately.  
MAITLAND: Yes, you will have to.  
IAN: But there are so many things we want to know.  
MAITLAND: There's only danger here for you. You must go.  
BARBARA: Danger? What sort of danger?  
MAITLAND: It's better that you don't know what happened to us.  
BARBARA: But we might be able to help you.  
DOCTOR: No. No, Barbara. I learned not to meddle in other people's affairs
years ago. (Ian laughs) Now, now, now, don't be absurd. There's not an ounce
of curiosity in me, my dear boy. Tell me, why are you in danger?  
MAITLAND: Very well, I'll try to explain. Out there is a planet we call the
Sensphere. The creatures on it, the Sensorites, have always prevented us from
leaving this area of space.  
DOCTOR: You mean they have some kind of power over your craft.  
MAITLAND: Exactly. But it's not that simple. They not only control our craft,
they have some influence over us as well.  
DOCTOR: Hypnosis, do you mean?  
MAITLAND: No, I do not mean hypnosis.  
DOCTOR: Well, what then?  
MAITLAND: Somehow they have some control over our brains. They are hostile,
these Sensorites, but in the strangest possible way. They won't let us leave
this area of space yet they don't attempt to kill us.  
SUSAN: What had happened when we found you?  
CAROL: The same thing that's happened many times before. The Sensorites have
put us into a deep sleep that gives the appearance of death, and yet they've
never made any actual effort to destroy us.  
MAITLAND: Far from it. We both have very hazy recollections of them returning
from time to time to our ship to actually feed us.  
IAN: Doesn't add up at all.  
CAROL: This is why you must leave us at once.  
MAITLAND: Yes. The Sensorites may try to prevent you from leaving.  
(An alien hand holds a device over the Tardis lock)  
BARBARA: I can smell something burning.  
SUSAN: So can I.  
MAITLAND: You mustn't delay any longer.  
IAN: I'm inclined to agree with him, Doctor. But surely there's something we
can do for you?  
MAITLAND: No. Nobody can help us.  
SUSAN: Grandfather, couldn't we take them back with us?  
MAITLAND: We cannot leave this ship.  
CAROL: You see, there's John to think of too.  
DOCTOR: John?  
BARBARA: Ian, there is something burning.  
IAN: Yes, I think you're right. Maitland, you wouldn't have anything shorting,
would you?  
MAITLAND: No, that's not possible.  
(Amid smoke, the alien hand withdraws the Tardis lock mechanism from the door)  
BARBARA: It seems to be coming from over here.  
DOCTOR: You have additional crew, I take it?  
CAROL: Yes.  
MAITLAND: Doctor, you must go. Leave us.  
DOCTOR: Well, it seems to me that there's nothing else I can do. Goodbye, my
friend. Bye, bye, my child. Come along, Susan.  
SUSAN: Goodbye.  
BARBARA: It's stronger over here, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oh? Perhaps it's coming from inside the Tardis.  
SUSAN: Grandfather!  
DOCTOR: Good gracious! They've taken the lock!  
SUSAN: It's not so much the lock, it's the opening mechanism. The door's
permanently locked!  
IAN: Permanently? But there must be some way of getting in? What can we do,
Doctor? Break down the door?  
DOCTOR: And disturb the field dimensions inside the Tardis? We dare not. We've
been most effectively shut out.  
BARBARA: The Sensorites?  
DOCTOR: Who else?  
SUSAN: What do they want with us?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. And why have they kept those other two in captivity,
hmm?  
(the ship shakes)  
CAROL: The Sensorites! Get back! Get away!  
IAN: Must get up the other end.  
DOCTOR: What is happening, my friend? Can't you control the ship?  
MAITLAND: I'm powerless. The Sensorites are stronger than I am.  
DOCTOR: Which is your parallel thrust?  
MAITLAND: There.  
DOCTOR: Right. Velocity, Chesterton. Check velocity.  
IAN: It's not even on the unit marker, Doctor.  
MAITLAND: Don't try and control the spacecraft. It's suicide, I tell you.  
DOCTOR: Please go away.  
IAN: The velocity needle's hitting the red, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Right, stabilisers, Maitland.  
(The ship stops shaking)  
DOCTOR: Oh, at last. At last. The ship was rolling about on its axis.  
SUSAN: Grandfather, look! We're heading straight for it.  
CAROL: It's the Sense-Sphere.  
DOCTOR: Where's your deflection rays? Maitland! Deflection rays.  
MAITLAND: There, the white panel. But it's useless.  
DOCTOR: Well, we'll see about that. We'll see about that. Reading, please.  
CAROL: Mach three, braking one.  
IAN: Nineteen miles to the nearest point of impact.  
CAROL: Closing fast.  
SUSAN: Barbara, we're going to hit. We're going to hit!  
CAROL: Lifting slightly.  
MAITLAND: You're on collision course.  
DOCTOR: Jet. Jet course. Port. Now.  
IAN: Velocity still rising.  
DOCTOR: Jet reverse. Starboard. Now.  
CAROL: Increasing to mach four. Heading straight for point of impact.  
IAN: The altitude is still falling.  
CAROL: Mach four.  
DOCTOR: Barbara, see that panel? Check status. Three lights normal.  
BARBARA: Yes. Three lights on.  
DOCTOR: Boost engines. Forward thrust and lock.  
(The planet fills the viewscreen, then they veer off to the left)  
MAITLAND: Why couldn't I do it?  
(later)  
DOCTOR: Well, my friend, are you feeling better?  
MAITLAND: Yes, my head's much clearer.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I rather fancy that's settled that little bit of solution.
You know, I think these Sensorites have found a way to take control of your
minds.  
IAN: Do you think they were deliberately trying to kill us, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: No, no, I don't. I think it was an exercise in fear and power.  
CAROL: Yes, but for some reason or other your minds aren't open to them.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and you found a way to resist them, whereas Maitland here, his
power to resist was taken from him.  
MAITLAND: I was afraid.  
IAN: You weren't afraid. They just made you hopeless.  
DOCTOR: Yes, they're dangerous and cunning, these people. But that's not all.
Things are very strange here. You know, they can control, they can frighten
and yet they don't attempt to kill you. Furthermore, they feed you and keep
you alive. All this is most extraordinary.  
IAN: Yes. Talking about food, I shall be glad when we eat. How's it coming
along?  
BARBARA: All right. Be ready in a minute.  
SUSAN: Iron rations a la carte.  
CAROL: Well, from the size of our stocks, they've obviously been giving us
their own food.  
BARBARA: What about water, Carol?  
CAROL: Down there on the right.  
BARBARA: Right, we'll find it.  
DOCTOR: Tell me, have either of you ever met any of these creatures or seen
them?  
CAROL: John has.  
IAN: Ah, he's the other member of your crew, isn't he.  
MAITLAND: Yes, our mineralogist.  
DOCTOR: I'd like to have a talk with him.  
MAITLAND: I'm afraid that's out of the question.  
DOCTOR: Oh? Why not?  
MAITLAND: I'd rather not talk about it.  
(Barbara and Susan walk past the tank marked water to a hatch)  
BARBARA: I suppose she meant the water was through this door. Let's try it.  
SUSAN: I can't see any handle on the door. Try this. That doesn't work.  
(then she spots the electric eye and waves her hand in front of it. The hatch
opens)  
SUSAN: That's funny. Oh, I see, it's the ray. I must have broken the
connection.  
BARBARA: Let's get that water. I'm dying of thirst.  
SUSAN: Yes, so am I.

**[Corridor]**

(They step through the hatch)  
BARBARA: Well, down here on the right, she said.  
(And another hand shuts the hatch behind them. It belongs to a shuffling man
with a glazed expression)

**[Cabin]**

(The women find a small room)  
BARBARA: I don't think we should stay in here.  
SUSAN: (picking up a book) Hey, this is bliss.  
BARBARA: I wonder where that water is?  
SUSAN: I don't know.  
BARBARA: Shh. Listen.  
(The shuffling footsteps come closer)

**[Control room]**

IAN: Don't you see? John may be able to give us some valuable information.  
CAROL: I told you. You can't see him.  
DOCTOR: You're both being rather secretive.  
IAN: Where are the others?  
(Maitland rushes to the hatch and tries to open it)  
MAITLAND: We should have warned them.  
IAN: What is it? What's wrong?  
CAROL: The door's been locked on the other side. Quickly. They're in danger.
We must get in from the other end.

**[Corridor]**

MAITLAND: This way. This is the other way through.  
CAROL: Oh, it's no use. The ray's been jammed on the other side.  
MAITLAND: I'm sorry, Ian. There's nothing we can do.  
IAN: But what is it? What's wrong? What's going on inside there?  
MAITLAND: It's no use, no use.  
IAN: Barbara! Susan!  
CAROL: No! No, please. No!  
IAN: Are there Sensorites in there?

**[Cabin]**

(The shuffling man comes right up to Barbara and Susan, they step to one side
and he falls over. They run back down the corridor but the hatch doesn't open
for them. They duck into a store room instead)

**[Store room]**

(The man comes in as they hide behind the filing cabinet, and starts crying,
then staggers out again without seeing them)

**[Control room]**

CAROL: We must find out about John.  
MAITLAND: We've been over this a hundred times before, Carol.  
CAROL: But the other times were different. The Sensorites made our decisions
for us.  
MAITLAND: As far as we know they still do.  
CAROL: But the Doctor and the others showed us we can resist them. We can!
It's only fear that makes us weak, that's all.  
MAITLAND: That may be so, but we mustn't go in there, Carol. It's too
dangerous.  
CAROL: What you really mean is, I mustn't go in there. You're afraid for me,
aren't you?  
MAITLAND: I know what John means to you.  
CAROL: The last time I saw him, he didn't even know my name. I must see him. I
must find out. Besides, there are the girls.  
MAITLAND: All right.  
IAN: Maitland, you must get that door opened.  
MAITLAND: Yes, I'll have to cut round the lock.  
IAN: All right, well get on with it.  
MAITLAND: I'll get the machine rigged up.  
IAN: Carol, tell me. What is it that you're both afraid of?  
CAROL: John's in there with your friends. He and I were going to get married
when we got back to the Earth. The Sensorites attacked him far more than
Captain Maitland and me. I had to sit there helplessly and watch him get worse
and worse.  
IAN: You mean they've taken over his mind.  
CAROL: Yes.  
IAN: What's it done to him? Carol, you've got to tell me.  
CAROL: He'll be frightened of strangers. He may become violent.

**[Corridor]**

(Barbara and Susan sneak out of the storage room, but don't see John leaning
against the wall. He pushes a lever then shuffles after them. They cannot open
any other doors. Just as they think he's going to attack them, he falls to his
knees)  
SUSAN: He's crying.  
JOHN: Who are you? You look like my sister. Have you come to help me? Four
years.  
BARBARA: Are you one of the crew of the spaceship? You want to tell me
something? About yourself?  
SUSAN: Is he trying to say he's ill?  
JOHN: Yes. Ill.  
BARBARA: (comforting him) Don't be afraid. We'll take care of you.  
SUSAN: What do you think happened to him, Barbara?

**[Control room]**

(Maitland is cutting into the door with a sonic device)  
IAN: Where's the power come from?  
MAITLAND: Electro-magnectics. We should be to the locks very soon.  
IAN: You say you haven't seen John for months?  
CAROL: He was dangerous once the Sensorites got at his brain.  
DOCTOR: Can't you go faster? Susan's in there.  
MAITLAND: It won't be long now.  
(There's a noise, Maitland stops)  
DOCTOR: Now what is it? Get on with the job, please.  
MAITLAND: Listen, don't you hear it? I thought there was something else.  
IAN: You mean that high-pitched whine? Is that it?  
MAITLAND: Sensorites.  
CAROL: They must be near. That noise is caused by the machines that carry them
through space.  
MAITLAND: Carol, get back to your instruments. Doctor, would you take the
controller seat?  
DOCTOR: Anything but this awful waiting.  
IAN: What about Barbara and Susan.  
MAITLAND: There's no time now. Look for glowing lights on the move about the
ship.  
IAN: How will they attack us?  
MAITLAND: They won't. Not in the normal way.  
IAN: Then how can we defend ourselves.  
MAITLAND: You'll find out soon enough. Look out there. There they are! See
them moving?  
IAN: Yes, but they look miles away.  
MAITLAND: It won't take them long to get here.  
IAN: How long do you think it'll take them, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I don't know. They must have made the journey before. They were here
before, remember? They took away the lock mechanism from my ship.  
IAN: Yes. Probably took it back to their own planet.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and now they're coming back, with what orders? To take over our
minds? Hmm? Or to kill us?

**[Corridor]**

BARBARA: Do you hear that?  
SUSAN: It's coming from outside.  
BARBARA: No, you need rest. There's nothing wrong.  
JOHN: I'll protect you.  
BARBARA: Yes. All right. You'll protect us.

**[Control room]**

IAN: Would it be a good idea to move?  
MAITLAND: Where to? We already know we can't leave this area of space.  
IAN: All the same, I think  
MAITLAND: Anyway, we're not going to be destroyed. Had the Sensorites intended
that, they would have done so long ago.  
IAN: If that collision course was their idea of a joke, I'd hate to be one of
their enemies.  
CAROL: They wouldn't really try to crash us. They just keep on playing this
game of nerves.  
DOCTOR: What's that noise?  
MAITLAND: Yes, we always hear that.  
CAROL: Interference now on all our scans.  
MAITLAND: Now remember, all of you, no violence unless the Sensorites start it
first.  
IAN: Why no violence? Surely we've got the right to protect ourselves?  
DOCTOR: My dear Chesterton. It's our minds that they take over, so we must
presume that the brain is all important. Now let our own intelligence be our
own defence, and attack.  
(It goes quiet)  
CAROL: I can sense them all around us now.  
MAITLAND: Shh.  
IAN: Doctor. Doctor.  
(A bulbous-headed humanoid is gazing at them from the outside of the ship)

__**Episode Two - The Unwilling Warriors**__

**[Control room]**

DOCTOR: Steady, Chesterton. The calmer you are, the stronger.  
IAN: Doctor, look at these two.  
DOCTOR: Maitland. Maitland! Can you hear me? Fear, my boy. It's loosened his
mind. It gives the Sensorites a chance to control it.  
IAN: Doctor, that thing's still out there.  
DOCTOR: Oh, ignore it. Maitland!  
MAITLAND: Yes. I hear you.  
DOCTOR: There's work to be done, my boy. Work. Understand?  
MAITLAND: Work.  
IAN: He's responding.  
DOCTOR: Yes, a door to be opened.  
MAITLAND: A door? Yes.  
DOCTOR: Danger on the other side.  
MAITLAND: John. Yes, we must get the two girls out.  
DOCTOR: Good, good, good.

**[Corridor]**

BARBARA: All we want you to do is open the door.  
JOHN: No. I'll protect you.  
SUSAN: But our friends are out there.  
JOHN: They're dead. All dead.  
BARBARA: But we were just with them.  
SUSAN: Just a few minutes ago. What is it?  
JOHN: They're here. Inside here.  
BARBARA: John, open the door.  
JOHN: Frighten them? No, I can't do that. No. No.  
SUSAN: Somebody's talking to him. Inside his mind.  
JOHN: No, don't force me. You can't. I won't do it. My head! Pain.
(unintelligible)  
SUSAN: Somebody's ordering him to do something, I know they are. Something to
harm us.

**[Control room]**

(At the hatchway)  
MAITLAND: I'll have to use the cutter.  
IAN: Oh, not again. How long will this take?  
MAITLAND: It's the only way.  
IAN: Yes, I know. Just that I'm so worried about Barbara and Susan.  
DOCTOR: Now, now, now. Try and contain your emotions. Use self-control.
Otherwise it confuses the brain and leaves it wide open to an attack by the
Sensorites. Look at Maitland here. Fear and inertia left him vulnerable.  
IAN: Yes, it's true enough, Doctor.  
CAROL: The Sensorites are in the ship now.  
IAN: What? How did they get here?  
CAROL: Through the loading bay.  
DOCTOR: But that can't be where Barbara and Susan are now?  
CAROL: No, but we must get to them as soon as possible.  
IAN: Nobody's arguing about that.  
DOCTOR: But that man John's with them.  
CAROL: The Sensorites have control over John's mind. They may force him to
obey their orders.  
IAN: How's it coming.  
MAITLAND: Slowly, but it's working.  
IAN: If only we knew what was happening on the other side of this door.
Barbara! Susan!

**[Corridor]**

(They can hear Ian thumping on the hatch)  
SUSAN: Listen. It's coming from outside.  
BARBARA: Yes, I can just hear it. It must be Ian trying to get through.  
SUSAN: Yes.  
JOHN: Give me your hand. They want me to frighten you. I mustn't give way.  
SUSAN: He's so tense, Barbara. Can't we help him?  
BARBARA: John, we're not afraid.  
JOHN: You're not afraid?  
BARBARA: Not while we have you to protect us.  
SUSAN: It's quiet and peaceful here. There's no real danger.  
JOHN: The Sensorites.  
BARBARA: We're your friends, John.  
JOHN: Friends. No, they are my friends!  
SUSAN: Barbara, I've got an idea.  
BARBARA: What?  
SUSAN: He's quiet now, but we can't be sure the Sensorites won't make him help
them. Look, if they can use their brains, why can't we use ours?  
BARBARA: To defend him?  
SUSAN: Yes, and ourselves. Grandfather and I landed on a planet once called
Esto. The plants there used thought transference. If you stood in between two
of the plants, they set up a sort of screeching noise. Grandfather said it was
because they were aware of another mind.  
BARBARA: Breaking in on their communications.  
SUSAN: Yes, exactly. I thought if we both tried together.  
BARBARA: Well anything's better than just sitting here.  
JOHN: Sensorites! They're near us now.  
SUSAN: You see? If we both think of the same thing at the same time.  
BARBARA: What do you mean? We defy you. Something like that?  
SUSAN: Yes. Yes, we defy you. We've got to picture the words very clearly in
our minds. We must both concentrate very hard. Ready?  
BARBARA: Yes. When I count to five. One, (cut to Sensorites) four, five.  
(The Sensorites clutch their big heads in pain, then Susan faints)

**[Control room]**

(Maitland starts to lift the hatch)  
MAITLAND: Oh, it's jammed. I'll have to cut the whole section out.  
IAN: We can't wait. I'll give you a hand. Ready?  
MAITLAND: That's it.  
IAN: It's going.  
(And they push the hatch door up and open, and go in)  
(Later - )  
DOCTOR: Yes, it might be possible for Susan's thoughts to reach out to the
Sensorites.  
CAROL: So we really can resist them?  
DOCTOR: Yes. And there's that friend of yours, you know. John. We must look
after him. Let me see now. Of course, they have a hold of his mind, you know.  
CAROL: He's sleeping peacefully now.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I wonder. Did Susan release the pressure?  
SUSAN: I had hundreds of voices in my mind, Grandfather.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and that was a dangerous thing to do, child. Because you were
strong-willed and without fear, they didn't harm you.  
MAITLAND: He's resting now. Did you know his hair was almost white?  
DOCTOR: There's nothing wrong with that.  
MAITLAND: In a man of thirty, Doctor? And he looks so old. Why have the
Sensorites done this? What do they want from us?  
DOCTOR: I  
IAN: Doctor. John muttered something just now, before he passed out. Sounded
like, the dreams of avarice. Now, on Earth we have a saying. Rich beyond the
dreams of avarice. I think he's discovered something. Would explain why he's
had the worst of it from the Sensorites.  
DOCTOR: Yes. What were John's duties?  
MAITLAND: He's our mineralogist.  
IAN: You see? Makes sense. John mumbling something about riches. I think he
must have discovered something that the Sensorites wanted to keep secret, so
they silenced him and kept all of you prisoners about their planet.  
DOCTOR: I see. And now they're trying to do the same to us. We must get the
lock of the Tardis back. Have you tried talking to them?  
MAITLAND: Talking to them?  
DOCTOR: Yes, we must try. We must.

**[Loading bay]**

(The Sensorites look the same, with beards that grow upwards to hide their
mouths)  
SENSORITE 1: (soft-spoken, holding a microphone to his forehead) The first
elder is communicating. Be alert while I listen. Yes. The first elder is
interested in human voice that said we defy you.  
SENSORITE 2: (a deeper voice) The human creatures who are newly arrived seem
to possess more intelligence than the others.  
SENSORITE 1: The first elder said that they have less fear of us. We are to
stay here and watch, and listen to them closely. If they try to attack us with
force, we are to summon our warriors to destroy them.

**[Control room]**

MAITLAND: One spectroscope, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: So I see.  
CAROL: I do remember he was beginning to take a reading of the minerals in the
vicinity.  
BARBARA: And then what happened?  
CAROL: That was the first time the Sensorites attacked us.  
DOCTOR: Would you like to look at that graph for a moment?  
IAN: Yes. Oh, there's nothing much here. Very ordinary collection of things.
Oxygen, hydrogen, sodium.  
SUSAN: What's that?  
IAN: It's a spectrograph, Susan. You see these lines? They represent the
emission wavelengths.  
SUSAN: Oh, yes, of course.  
IAN: No, there certainly isn't anything very special indicated on this.  
CAROL: You're very strange people.  
SUSAN: Are we?  
CAROL: Well, you've come from nowhere and you seem to be going nowhere.  
BARBARA: We're very dependant on the Doctor. He leads and we follow.  
CAROL: Travel without a purpose?  
BARBARA: Oh, no, there's a purpose in it. He's trying to get us back to our
own time. On Earth.  
CAROL: Oh, I see.  
SUSAN: Isn't' it a better thing to travel hopefully than arrive?  
CAROL: Anything's better than circling round a planet for ever and being kept
alive. Alive. It's been more like a living death.  
DOCTOR: (having looked through a notebook) I just don't understand. There must
be a clue here somewhere. There must be.  
IAN: Well I don't know, Doctor. Certainly isn't here.  
MAITLAND: I studied it whenever I could, but it didn't look like anything that
would cause much excitement. The Sensphere is just an ordinary planet with a
slightly bigger land mass than usual, but that's all.  
DOCTOR: Yes. That's very interesting. May I?  
MAITLAND: Certainly.  
DOCTOR: Excuse me.  
SUSAN: I know the Sensorites have discovered thought transference.  
BARBARA: Yes. And when John discovered something, he became so excited that
his mind opened up and broadcast it to the Sensorites. And it was something
they wanted kept a secret.  
DOCTOR: What? What is this? What was it Chesterton said? Rich beyond the
dreams of avarice. Yes. Of course. Of course! I know what he found.  
IAN: What?  
DOCTOR: Molybdenum. It's here, in the graph, but it's all mixed up with the
lines so it doesn't make obvious reading.  
IAN: Molybdenum?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
MAITLAND: It resists very high temperatures.  
DOCTOR: Yes. It's used as an alloy in steel. In fact this machine would be
useless without it. Now let me see. Iron melts at one thousand five hundred
and thirty nine degrees centigrade, and molybdenum melts at two thousand six
hundred and twenty two degrees centigrade. So, you know, we've some idea. Yes,
I see now just what John found. I wonder if he was excited. Yes, that planet
must be full of it. Full of it! It's a veritable gold mine!  
(Maitland and Carol clutch their heads)  
MAITLAND: Sensorites!  
CAROL: They're here. On the ship.  
IAN: Come on, Barbara. Let's find them.

**[Corridor]**

(They go quietly past where John is sleeping, through a room into another
corridor, then up to a door)  
BARBARA: Where do you suppose this leads?  
IAN: I don't know. Let's find out. Needn't come if you don't want to.  
BARBARA: Nonsense.  
(Ian waves his hand in front of the electric eye, the door opens)

**[Room]**

(The Sensorites step out in front of them. Ian grabs a metal tool from a
cupboard)  
IAN: Open the door.  
(Barbara does so and they back out again)

**[Corridor]**

IAN: Go and find Maitland. Ask him how to lock these doors.  
BARBARA: But Ian.  
IAN: Go on. Don't worry about me. Go on.  
(The door opens and the Sensorites step out. Ian keeps backing away, into
another room)

**[Control room]**

BARBARA: Just tell me, how do we lock the doors? Please, try and concentrate.  
DOCTOR: The sick member of the crew. Try him.  
BARBARA: He'll be in no condition to help.  
DOCTOR: Do as I say.

**[John's room]**

BARBARA: John. Show me how to lock the doors. The Sensorites are on the ship.
We must stop them.

**[Corridor]**

(She helps him out into the corridor as Ian is backing into it. Ian raises his
weapon)  
BARBARA: Ian, no.  
IAN: Why not? How else can I keep these creatures off?  
BARBARA: Well, do you need to keep them off? Have they actually attacked you?
Come on, John. Lock the door.  
(John waves his hand in front of a lower electric eye)  
JOHN: They can't open now.  
BARBARA: It's strange they didn't harm you.  
JOHN: No.  
IAN: I think they were as frightened of me as I was of them.  
BARBARA: They're not very aggressive, are they.  
IAN: No.  
BARBARA: Come on, let's get back to the others.  
IAN: The others! The other way! The Sensorites can get through that way!

**[Control room]**

MAITLAND: It's beginning to clear now.  
(Ian dashes through to the other hatchway and waves at the electric eye)  
BARBARA: Bolt the door, John. Bolt it.  
IAN: Now we'll see what the Sensorites can do.  
(What they can do is hold a device to the electric eye, and the door just
swings open again. But they decide not to open the main hatch door)  
DOCTOR: This is all very well, but I think we should try and contact them.  
BARBARA: Are you two feeling better now?  
MAITLAND: Much better.  
CAROL: Oh, I don't know what happened, but I'm certainly feeling better now.  
(The Sensorites are using their communications devices. Susan twitches and
jumps)  
IAN: I'm sure it's no coincidence that the Sensorites attacked you as soon as
you discovered molybdenum.  
SUSAN: Yes, but they won't agree to that.  
DOCTOR: Agree? To what? What are you talking about, child?  
SUSAN: I'm sure they'll talk to you about it.  
BARBARA: Susan, what is it?  
SUSAN: All right, I'll ask them. I'll tell you later. The Sensorites want to
know if it's all right for them to talk to you.  
IAN: Are you saying that you're in  
DOCTOR: Are you saying you've made contact with them?  
SUSAN: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Well of course we shall see them, but they must agree not to harm us.  
SUSAN: Right.  
DOCTOR: If they try to harm us then I shall fight them.  
(Susan silently relays the message, then opens the main hatch door. The
Sensorites step in)  
SENSORITE 1: Which one is the Doctor?  
SENSORITE 2: The one with the white hair.  
DOCTOR: Speak up. I can't hear you.  
SENSORITE 1: We have been speaking to each other.  
DOCTOR: What is it you want of us? Why don't you let these space people go
back to their Earth, hmm?  
SENSORITE 2: None of you can ever again leave the area of the Sensphere.  
IAN: Why not?  
SENSORITE 1: You know the answer to that.  
IAN: Because of molybdenum. We are not interested in it.  
SENSORITE 2: So you say, but once before we trusted Earth men, to our cost.  
DOCTOR: So Earth men have visited the Sensphere.  
SENSORITE 1: Yes, and they caused us a fearful affliction. We shall not allow
it to happen again.  
MAITLAND: What do you expect us to do? Drift around for ever?  
SENSORITE 1: No, you must all come back with us. A special area has been
prepared for you on the Sensphere. There you will live, and there you will be
looked after.  
DOCTOR: These people cannot possibly accede to your request. It's out of the
question.  
SENSORITE 2: You will do exactly as we tell you because you have no choice.
None of you.  
DOCTOR: My party does have a choice, and I assure you we have no intention of
spending the rest of our lives with you.  
IAN: Well, you have our answer. What do you propose to do?  
SENSORITE 1: We intend taking you down to the Sensphere, but we do not wish to
harm you in any way.  
IAN: Since we've met you, we have no wish to harm you either, but you must get
off this ship.  
SENSORITE 1: What if we refuse?  
IAN: We will attack you.  
SENSORITE 1: The other Earth people will not be able to help you.  
BARBARA: Surely we've proved that we don't need help.  
SENSORITE 2: You have only proved that you can lock doors. We can unlock them.  
DOCTOR: Now listen to me, both of you. You've taken the lock of my ship and I
want it returned immediately.  
SENSORITE 1: You're in no position to threaten us.  
DOCTOR: I don't make threats. But I do keep promises. And I promise you I
shall cause you more trouble than you bargained for if you don't return my
property!  
SENSORITE 2: We must decide what we shall do.  
(The Sensorites leave)  
BARBARA: What do they mean, decide?  
IAN: I don't know. Sounds as though there's something else they can do to us.  
DOCTOR: So they might have been referring to Susan.  
SUSAN: The Sensorites only spoke to me through my  
DOCTOR: Next time, if there is a next time, they might try and control your
mind, my child. Like they've done to these two people.  
MAITLAND: Doctor, is there no way you can get into your own ship?  
DOCTOR: No, not unless they return what they stole from my ship.  
CAROL: But they'll never give it back to you.  
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear, they're not invincible. Oh, no, no, no. Did any of you
notice the peculiarity in their eyes?  
MAITLAND: No, I can't say I did.  
DOCTOR: It's a fallacy, of course, that cats can see in the dark. They can't.
But they can see better than we humans, because the iris of their eyes dilates
at night. Yes.  
IAN: What are you driving at, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Oh, it's all perfectly simple, Chesterton. You see, the Sensorites
eyes are the exact opposite to that of a cat. The Sensorites eyes were
completely dilated, that is, enormous, in light.  
IAN: The conclusion being that they would contract in darkness.  
DOCTOR: Exactly. And that is our best weapon. The Sensorites will be
frightened of the dark.  
SUSAN: You can't be sure of that. You're only sure they can't see in the dark.  
DOCTOR: I very much doubt, my child, whether they can see in the semi-
darkness.  
BARBARA: But Doctor, assuming you're right  
IAN: Which he is, of course.  
DOCTOR: Naturally.  
BARBARA: Well, how can you be sure that the Sensorites will be frightened of
the dark?  
DOCTOR: My dear Barbara, wouldn't you be afraid if you couldn't see your
enemies, hmm? Thank you for your admiration, dear boy. Thank you.  
IAN: I never said a word.  
DOCTOR: Telepathy. You know, telepathy isn't only a prerequisite of the
Sensorites. I know sometimes what you're thinking.  
SUSAN: Don't want to go.  
DOCTOR: My dear. What?  
BARBARA: They're talking to her again.  
IAN: What are they saying?  
SUSAN: Shh. I can't hear them very well. Oh, that's better. There's just one
voice a long way away.  
DOCTOR: Well, what's the message, child?  
SUSAN: Oh. Oh, all right. But none of the others must be harmed. Don't move,
any of you. Grandfather, it was the only way. They knew I'd agree.  
DOCTOR: Agree? To what?  
SUSAN: To go down with them to their planet, otherwise we'll all be killed.  
(and the Sensorites close the hatch door behind them)

__**Episode Three - Hidden Danger**__

BARBARA: Susan mustn't go with them.  
DOCTOR: There can't be air outside the spaceship.  
MAITLAND: You can't stop them.  
DOCTOR: We must!  
IAN: Come with me, Barbara.  
CAROL: Don't. They'll only harm her or kill her if you try and interfere.  
IAN: And if we do nothing, she'll die.  
BARBARA: Do you intend to try out the Doctor's theory that they can't see in
the dark?  
IAN: Why not? It's all we have.

**[Corridor]**

SENSORITE 1: Go back.  
SUSAN: Don't interfere, please.  
SENSORITE 1: The young girl has agreed to go with us. She will not be harmed.
Why do you follow us now?  
BARBARA: She must not go with you.  
SENSORITE 2: They are not carrying any weapons, yet I am frightened of them.  
SENSORITE 1: Do not come any nearer.  
IAN: We want to talk to you.  
SENSORITE 2: We have no wish to harm you in any way.  
IAN: I said talk, not fight.  
SENSORITE 2: Intruders from other planets always say they wish to talk, but
all they mean to do is destroy.  
SUSAN: Ian, please let me go with them. Because I can use telepathy, they
trust me.  
BARBARA: You're not going with them, Susan, and that's final.  
SUSAN: Why? It's suspicion that's making them enemies. You don't understand
the Sensorites.  
DOCTOR: Do you think I don't understand? Trust is a two-sided affair.  
SUSAN: You're putting us all in danger.  
DOCTOR: If you go with them, then they will have all the advantage.  
SUSAN: But they only want to talk to me.  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Susan, but I don't believe you have the ability to
represent us. That's all.  
SUSAN: Stop treating me like a child.  
DOCTOR: You will do as you're told, Susan. Come here.  
SUSAN: I'm sorry, Grandfather, I can't do it.  
DOCTOR: This instant!  
(Susan steps forward)  
SENSORITE 1: We must stun them with the hand rays.  
DOCTOR: Now, Chesterton.  
(Ian switches the lights off, and in the twilight the Sensorites drop their
weapons and flail about)  
IAN: You were absolutely right, Doctor. They're helpless in the dark.  
(Ian picks up the weapons)  
DOCTOR: Susan, go and join Carol. Wait there. I want to talk to you.  
SENSORITE 2: Give us back the light.  
SENSORITE 1: The light, the light. I'm afraid. Afraid. Please, help us.  
DOCTOR: Put on the light, Chesterton. You could have been left here in the
darkness. We have power over you, but we don't intend to use it. Only in our
defence.  
SENSORITE 1: What do you want?  
DOCTOR: Nothing that isn't ours.  
IAN: You stole the lock from our ship. You also threatened to take us
prisoner.  
SENSORITE 1: We must ask for new orders.  
DOCTOR: What's that? Speak up!  
SENSORITE 1: I must refer this matter to the Sensphere.  
DOCTOR: Well?  
SENSORITE 2: You must be patient.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I won't put up with this nonsense. If they try anything, put the
light out again.  
IAN: All right, I will.  
DOCTOR: Dictated to by petty thieves and my own grandchild!  
IAN: I wonder what that thing is that they put up to their foreheads, Barbara.
Do you think if we did it, we could read each other's minds? Hey, Barbara.  
BARBARA: Sorry, I was thinking. You know, I've never seen the Doctor so angry.  
IAN: Oh, yes. Susan set him off, didn't she. The Sensorites must have
hypnotised her in some way.  
BARBARA: No, I don't think so. She's just growing up, Ian.

**[Control room]**

DOCTOR: What is all this, setting yourself against me, hmm?  
SUSAN: I didn't, Grandfather.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I know you thought you were doing your best, child, in the
circumstances, but I think I'm a better judge of that.  
SUSAN: Well, I have opinions too.  
DOCTOR: My dear girl, the one purpose in growing old is to accumulate
knowledge and wisdom, and to help other people.  
SUSAN: So I'm to be treated like a silly little child.  
DOCTOR: If you behave like one, yes.  
SUSAN: Oh, look, Grandfather. I understand the Sensorites. They're timid
little people. Because their minds and mine can communicate sometimes, they
trust me.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and I assure you we shall make good use of that fact, but not
without discussions. You will not make decisions on your own accord. Now, do
you understand? Is that quite clear? Well, is it?  
SUSAN: Look, I'm not saying I'm as clever as you, of course I'm not. But I
won't be pushed aside. I'm not a child anymore, Grandfather. I'm not.  
DOCTOR: Oh, Susan, Susan.  
SENSORITE 1: Why do you make her unhappy?  
SENSORITE 2: We can read the misery in her mind.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and it's a good thing you can't read the anger in mine. In all
the years my granddaughter and I have been travelling, we have never had an
argument. And now you have caused one.  
SUSAN: All right, Grandfather, I'll do as you tell me.  
DOCTOR: Good, good. Now let's work together and see if we can't get the lock
of the Tardis back, hmm?  
SENSORITE 1: We have orders from the First Elder.  
IAN: Is he your ruler?  
SENSORITE 2: Yes.  
SENSORITE 1: He says we are to listen to you and to transmit your words to
him.  
DOCTOR: Very well, I'd like to talk to him, face to face. I want to arrange
the release of this spaceship. Tell him we're not pirates or plunderers.
There's only one treasure we desire from him.  
SENSORITE 1: What is that?  
DOCTOR: Freedom.

**[John's room]**

(Carol is stroking his hair when he suddenly sits up)  
CAROL: Oh, it's all right, John. I'm here.  
JOHN: The voices. I can hear them.  
CAROL: I know.  
JOHN: In here. The voices. Afraid. Begging me.  
CAROL: John. John, do you know who I am?  
JOHN: You're good. The Sensorites, they want me to forget. All the voices
begging me and imploring me to forget.  
CAROL: John's just woken up.  
MAITLAND: You look much better, John. Much better. We'll soon have you as good
as new.  
JOHN: I don't like the voices. I want to have silence in my head.  
MAITLAND: You're going to be all right, John. Try not to upset yourself.  
JOHN: No. Silence. Silence.  
CAROL: It's no use, is it. He might as well be dead.  
MAITLAND: That's foolish, Carol.  
CAROL: Oh, is it? Look at him. Listen to him. Can you imagine what it's like
being in love with someone, to look at them, to see them and know they've been
destroyed.  
MAITLAND: You're going down to the Sensphere with John and some of the others.
They're going to cure him.  
CAROL: Oh, it's no use. It's too late.  
JOHN: You're good.

**[Control room]**

BARBARA: And you can do something for John? Really?  
SENSORITE 1: Yes, in time.  
IAN: And that's the whole point, isn't it. How long? You're asking Barbara and
Maitland to stay on the spaceship while we go down to the Sensphere.  
SENSORITE 1: We cannot trust you without some safeguard.  
IAN: But you're asking us to trust you.  
SENSORITE 1: We shall prove trust by curing the man called John.  
IAN: Well I don't like this splitting up.  
BARBARA: Well, I don't mind, Ian.  
IAN: Well I do. It always leads to trouble.  
SENSORITE 1: We cannot agree to any other arrangement.  
BARBARA: Then we accept.  
IAN: Oh, very well then. And how do we get down to this Sensphere? There's no
air outside the ship.  
SENSORITE 1: A craft will be made available to you.  
DOCTOR: Before we make this journey, one or two questions.  
SENSORITE 1: There's time. The craft has not arrived yet.  
DOCTOR: These discs you wear round your neck. You press them to your forehead
and you speak or hear through your mind, hmm?  
SENSORITE 1: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Otherwise, you communicate as we do.  
SENSORITE 1: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Quite remarkable. Then you use telepathy to blanket out
the minds of the spaceship's crew, hmm?  
SUSAN: Gently, Grandfather. Don't antagonise them.  
DOCTOR: I merely want to know why you attacked Maitland and the others.  
SENSORITE 1: Ten years ago, five human beings landed on the Sensphere. Our
planet welcomed them. Their minds were closed against us, although we sensed
they thought our planet was a rich one.  
DOCTOR: Yes, rich in minerals, yes, quite. Go on.  
SENSORITE 1: Then the five men quarrelled. Two of the humans took off in a
ship. It exploded a mile in the atmosphere.  
BARBARA: What happened to the other three men?  
SENSORITE 1: We imagine they hid themselves aboard, then fought the other two
for control. Anyway, all were killed.  
IAN: Yes, but that still doesn't explain why you attacked Maitland and the
others.  
SENSORITE 1: Ever since that day of the explosion in the sky, our people have
been dying in greater numbers every year.  
DOCTOR: Yes, some kind of disease I imagine, Chesterton.  
IAN: Maybe.  
BARBARA: Could be as simple as scarlet fever.  
SUSAN: And yet you're allowing us to visit your planet?  
SENSORITE 1: Our people are dying, and the First Elder says he senses great
knowledge in you.  
DOCTOR: Ah ha! I thought so. Yes, yes, yes, some kind of bargaining ahead of
us.  
SENSORITE 2: The craft is approaching.  
IAN: Well I suppose it's worth it, Doctor, if we get the lock of the Tardis
back.  
DOCTOR: Yes, provided we can produce our side of the bargain. That's the whole
point of the issue. Well, my dear. Reluctant as I am to leave you, I'm afraid
we have no alternative.  
BARBARA: Oh, I shall be all right. I'm more worried about you.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I shall manage. Come along my boy. Susan.  
IAN: Sorry about this, Barbara.  
BARBARA: I keep telling you I shall be all right.  
IAN: All right.  
BARBARA: Susan.  
SUSAN: Yes?  
BARBARA: Look, I know how you feel, but your grandfather loves you.  
SUSAN: Yes, I know.  
BARBARA: Be patient. We're all on your side really, you know.  
DOCTOR: Susan. We can't do without you. Can we?  
IAN: Well, we're all ready now.  
SENSORITE 1: I will stay on this ship. You must proceed to the Sensphere. The
First Elder awaits you.

**[Palace of the Elders - Reception room]**

(Three Sensorites are present. The First Elder has crossed sashes, the Second
Elder a single sash, and the City Administrator a dark collar)  
1ST ELDER: But I have already made my decision.  
2ND ELDER: The deaths of our people will increase.  
1ST ELDER: You cannot prove that.  
2ND ELDER: The deaths began at the time of the last visit of human beings. Why
should we welcomed to our planet the same creatures who have been the means of
our destruction.  
1ST ELDER: I am the ruler of this planet, am I not?  
2ND ELDER: Of course.  
1ST ELDER: Then what is the point of a ruler if he's not allowed to rule? I
have decided to invite these humans because I hope to use them to end the
deaths of our own people.  
2ND ELDER: But how?  
1ST ELDER: I will explain. Sometimes one must use fire to make fire.  
2ND ELDER: The First Elder makes a wise decision. In one degree I confess I am
anxious. These creatures, these Earth people, are loud and ugly things. Why
could we not have met them in the desert or in the mountains?  
1ST ELDER: It is a failure of all beings that they judge through their own
eyes. To them, we may appear to be ugly. What we must create between us is
trust. That is why I have invited them to my palace.  
2ND ELDER: But are we sure these Earth creatures are beings as you say? There
are animals in the deserts and mountains, but we do not invite them in to our
palaces. Perhaps these Earth creatures are animals too?  
1ST ELDER: Do not underestimate them. Do we possess a spaceship that can cross
the barriers of the universe? And this small mechanism, which my men brought
to me, looks like an ordinary lock but in point of fact is an electronic
miracle which reveals a mind of science far beyond ours. And this new arrival
known as the Doctor. His mind was quick to realise our weakness in the dark
and use it against us, but, I would remind you, not unfairly. Merely to
protect the girl called Susan. Well, and what does our city administrator say?  
ADMINISTRATOR: Sir, you were elected to lead our people because of your great
brain. I would not dare to question your actions.  
1ST ELDER: No opinion can be worse sometimes than a very dogmatic one.  
(The First Elder leaves)  
2ND ELDER: You need not fear me. You may speak your mind.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I am cautious. You are his second opinion, yet he makes his
decisions without you.  
2ND ELDER: He makes a wise decision.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Based entirely upon trust. Do you trust these Earth creatures?
No more do I.  
2ND ELDER: The decision of the First Elder cannot be set aside.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I would not suggest such a thing. His mind is pure. We are
realists. That is why I have beamed the disintegrator to this room.  
2ND ELDER: Without permission? You are presumptuous.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I am the city's administrator. It is my duty to protect the one
who rules. Can you say that these Earth creatures will not use force? I am
only guarding the First Elder. One suspicious act and the disintegrator will
destroy them.  
2ND ELDER: Very well. But you will do nothing further until I have considered
the matter.  
(leaves)  
ADMINISTRATOR: I shall not wait. We will not be safe until these Earth
creatures are dead.

**[Courtyard]**

(Strolling through the city, past a fountain)  
DOCTOR: I'm glad to have left those silent people.  
SENSORITE 2: Earth people are not popular.  
IAN: Because your people have been dying?  
SENSORITE 2: Yes.  
DOCTOR: It must be explained to them. The disease, if that's what it is, isn't
anybody's fault. Besides, there's cures and preventives.  
SENSORITE 2: You mentioned explaining to the people. You must not speak to
them. You are forbidden to talk to the lower caste.  
SUSAN: Lower caste? Do you have such distinctions?  
SENSORITE 2: Yes. How else can we tell what each man is best fitted to do? The
Elders think and rule, the Warriors fight, the Sensorites work and play.  
DOCTOR: You make it sound so very simple.  
SENSORITE 2: And all are happy.  
IAN: But some are happier than others, eh?  
SENSORITE 2: I do not understand. There is no disgrace in being in any of the
castes. It is simply what one is best fitted for.  
JOHN: They're near us now.  
CAROL: It's all right, John. I'm here.  
JOHN: The evil minds.  
SUSAN: He knows something.  
CAROL: Oh, it's just a jumble of words.  
SUSAN: No, Carol, no. Remember, his mind is open. He can tell the difference
between good and evil people. He's trying to tell us something.  
CAROL: Come on. Come on. Come on.

**[Disintegrator control]**

ADMINISTRATOR: Is everything prepared?  
ENGINEER: I must test the impulse circuits. Ready to receive power.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Here is the firing key. Beam the disintegrator to the reception
room at the Palace of the Elders.  
ENGINEER: Ready.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Three places have been assigned to the Earth creatures.
Horizontal lines four  
ENGINEER: Four.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Seven and nine.  
ENGINEER: Nine. The vertical positions?  
ADMINISTRATOR: X A two.  
ENGINEER: X A two.  
ADMINISTRATOR: X B three.  
ENGINEER: X B three. And the last?  
ADMINISTRATOR: X C four.  
ENGINEER: X C four. What part of the body do you want the beam to strike?  
ADMINISTRATOR: In each case, to the heart.  
ENGINEER: Are the hearts of the human creatures on the right or left side of
their bodies, or in the centre as in ours?  
ADMINISTRATOR: I do not know.  
ENGINEER: Then I will aim the beam at the centre of the chest in each case.  
ADMINISTRATOR: And that will prove fatal?  
ENGINEER: Yes. Two, eight, seven. The disintegrator is beamed and ready. They
are just entering the corridor to the reception room now. Impulses working
correctly. They are just entering the reception room. This switch here turns
on the beam.  
ADMINISTRATOR: How can you judge their movements so correctly, Engineer?  
ENGINEER: The palace is defended with electrothermal couples. We trace their
movements by the heat of their bodies.  
ADMINISTRATOR: And you can tell exactly when they move into their places in
the reception room?  
ENGINEER: With absolute accuracy.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Then when they are seated, kill them.

**[Reception room]**

1ST ELDER: Very well, I agree.  
SUSAN: You can do it?  
1ST ELDER: Yes. The man John can be exactly as he used to be, but it will take
time. Conduct him to one of the rest rooms. Say that my orders are that he
must be treated.  
CAROL: I must go with him, because he needs me.  
1ST ELDER: Very well. You will be given a room near him.  
CAROL: Thank you. Come on, John.  
JOHN: Good. He is a good man. Not like.  
DOCTOR: Not like who, John?  
JOHN: He is good.  
(Carol and John leave)  
IAN: Thank you for being so understanding.  
DOCTOR: It doesn't alter the fact that you're responsible for his condition. I
think it's utterly disgraceful.  
1ST ELDER: Please, do not condemn before you know the facts.  
DOCTOR: Facts? What facts, sir?  
SUSAN: Grandfather, please don't.  
DOCTOR: Very well.  
1ST ELDER: Please sit at the places set for you.

**[Disintegrator control]**

ENGINEER: They are just taking their positions.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Get ready to fire.  
2ND ELDER: Stop! Disconnect the disintegrator.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Why?  
2ND ELDER: Because they are reasonable, they are civilised.  
ADMINISTRATOR: They are Earth creatures, and dangerous to us.  
2ND ELDER: I tell you, they're talking with the First Elder, and in a most
friendly fashion. We need not fear them.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Not whilst we have the disintegrator. It is beamed to their
positions. They can be destroyed in a second.  
2ND ELDER: But they will not be. Dismantle the machine.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I say that the trust that we give to each other, we cannot show
to these Earth creatures.  
2ND ELDER: And I order that the machine be dismantled. Give me the firing key.  
(The Engineer hands it over)  
2ND ELDER: I am doubtful about you. You question orders, you question
authority. Take care lest my doubts are become realities.

**[Reception room]**

(The Doctor, Ian and Susan are being served refreshments)  
1ST ELDER: If foreigners visited your planet with intention to steal, what
would you do? Would you imprison them? Would you kill them? The man John was
like the other humans who came here. He became so excited when he found that
our planet contained a valuable ore that his mind just opened up and shouted
out the secret to us.  
DOCTOR: Molybdenum.  
1ST ELDER: That is correct. He thought of a fleet of spaceships to come here
and mine the metal and transport it back to his own planet. We saw the
pictures he formed in his mind, and we saw that it was the end of our way of
life. We had no alternative but to imprison him and his friends in orbit round
the Sensphere.  
IAN: Yes, but that's no reason for driving him out of his mind.  
1ST ELDER: Happened only, I assure you, because of his excitement. His mind
had no reserve, no defence. We caused the others to sleep, but he heard the
full power of our voices in his brain. Stop. Do not drink. Why do you offer
insult to our guests? Why do you not give them the same food and drink that I
am given? Who ordered this? The city Administrator?  
(The serving Sensorite nods)  
1ST ELDER: You will bring them the crystal water and take the other away.  
IAN: Tell me, what exactly is the difference?  
1ST ELDER: In the yellow mountains that surround this city, I discovered a
pure spring. Very unusual in this planet. I believe the water holds special
qualities, so I have flagons of it stored for the use of the Elders.  
IAN: And this one?  
1ST ELDER: Is very well refined. We are very proud of our aqueduct. It lies
beneath the city.  
IAN: I hope you won't be offended if I drink some. I'm very thirsty. (drinks)  
1ST ELDER: As long as you taste of the crystal water. It is very fine. None of
the Elders drink anything else.  
DOCTOR: Vintage water.  
SUSAN: This fruit is delicious. It tastes like peaches.  
(The water is exchanged)  
DOCTOR: Now, sir, let us talk of the future. Our future.

**[Disintegrator control]**

ADMINISTRATOR: We are being bound hand and foot and given to these people from
Earth. Our leaders are grown weak.  
ENGINEER: I will follow you, the city Administrator. Command me.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I thank you for your loyalty. You shall have my confidence.  
ENGINEER: I gladly accept. I do not trust these Earth creatures.  
ADMINISTRATOR: The First and Second Elders are deceived. I question their
leadership. If they do not change their attitude, they may have to give way to
one of stronger thought and action.  
ENGINEER: Command me.  
ADMINISTRATOR: For the moment, I am glad of your loyalty. The time for action
will not be far away.

**[Reception room]**

SUSAN: So you are the senior Elder?  
1ST ELDER: Signified by the twin sash I wear. The Second Elder, my advisor,
wears one sash. Other important professions wear distinctive markings.  
DOCTOR: And the ordinary people?  
1ST ELDER: Are contented with their similarity.  
IAN: Would you mind telling us something about the (sudden coughing fit) I beg
your pardon. The disease.  
SUSAN: Yes, would you tell us about it. We might be able to help you.  
1ST ELDER: I intended to. We need help with this calamity. The disease is
invisible, and resists all our attempts to stamp it out. It hits all manner of
people, irrespective of their tasks.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Does it affect the Elders?  
1ST ELDER: No.  
DOCTOR: I wonder why not?  
1ST ELDER: I cannot imagine. We have been fortunate?  
(Ian coughs again)  
DOCTOR: Yes, it, er, might be a clue. But what I hope, sir, was this er, that
if my friends and I succeed where your scientists failed, will you return the
lock of my ship?  
SUSAN: It would be a just return.  
1ST ELDER: Your granddaughter speaks well.  
DOCTOR: Yes, she's a fine young woman. My dear Chesterton, are you all right?  
IAN: My throat, burning. I wonder if you could give me a glass of water,
Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Is this a symptom of your disease?  
(Ian collapses)  
SUSAN: Ian! Grandfather, he's unconscious.  
1ST ELDER: There is no hope. Your friend is dying.

__**Episode Four - A Race Against Death**__

**[Reception room]**

(Ian is lying face down on the floor)  
DOCTOR: Why has it happened to him and not to us?  
SUSAN: Can you do anything for him?  
1ST ELDER: The disease hits all manner of people. Suddenly, without warning.  
DOCTOR: Never the Elders?  
1ST ELDER: No.  
DOCTOR: It's incredible. The build-up in body temperature. This disease, as
you call it, is it contagious?  
1ST ELDER: No.  
DOCTOR: I wonder. Is it a germ in the air?  
SUSAN: Grandfather, it doesn't seem like a disease at all.  
DOCTOR: I agree with you.  
SUSAN: We've done everything together. We've come from the spaceship together,
we've come through the city together.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes.  
SUSAN: This room. The fruit.  
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no, no. You had some of it.  
SUSAN: Oh, yes.  
DOCTOR: I know. He drank a different kind of water. It's the water!  
1ST ELDER: Then why do not all who drink the aqueduct water die?  
DOCTOR: Well, it depends on their resistance. In time, of course, all will
succumb.  
1ST ELDER: You cannot be sure of this.  
DOCTOR: No, I can't. This is all we have to go on. Send for your servant,
please.  
SUSAN: His eyes are opening, Grandfather.  
IAN: (very hoarse) Susan.  
DOCTOR: It's all right, Chesterton. Rest quietly. This isn't a disease, it's
more like poison.  
(The servant arrives and bows)  
DOCTOR: Oh, go to your scientists now. I want some sodium chloride and I want
it quickly.  
IAN: What happened to me?  
SUSAN: Hush, Ian. Just rest.  
1ST ELDER: Do you wish your companion to stay here?  
DOCTOR: Please, please.  
1ST ELDER: Bring some covers.  
DOCTOR: Now, sir, your indulgence.  
1ST ELDER: I am distressed by this tragedy. What can I do to be of assistance?  
DOCTOR: Well, we must make sure no one drinks anything but the crystal water.  
1ST ELDER: Agreed.  
DOCTOR: Fine. And can I work with your scientists?  
1ST ELDER: They will be honoured.  
DOCTOR: Splendid, splendid.  
SUSAN: How long has he got?  
1ST ELDER: I hear the distress in your mind. I respond to it. I wish I could
be more reassuring.  
SUSAN: How long?  
1ST ELDER: From the first symptoms, no one has lived longer than the third
day.  
DOCTOR: As long as that? Then we have time. I have chemicals and equipment on
my ship. Return the lock and I promise you, sir, I will not only cure my young
friend but all your people.  
(The servant returns)  
DOCTOR: Ah, good.  
1ST ELDER: I must discuss this matter with the Second Elder.  
DOCTOR: Well do not delay any longer than is necessary, please. Thank you.
Now, salt and water, Susan. An old-fashioned remedy but I'm sure it'll serve.
Thank you. Now, my boy.  
SUSAN: Ian. Ian, try and sit up.  
DOCTOR: Come along, old chap.  
IAN: Feeling very weak, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Yes, now I want you to drink all of this. It isn't going to be
pleasant, but it's all for your own good.  
IAN: Drink.  
DOCTOR: That's it.  
(Ian drinks, splutters at the saltiness)  
DOCTOR: Will they let me into my ship?

**[Courtyard]**

2ND ELDER: Now be guided by me in this matter. The one they call the Doctor
may not be sincere.  
1ST ELDER: But his friend is dying.  
2ND ELDER: Or pretending to die. Then you let the Doctor into his spaceship.  
1ST ELDER: Would he leave his friends at our mercy?  
2ND ELDER: But who knows what power he has in the ship? Once inside it, we may
be at his mercy.  
1ST ELDER: Well, I believe in him.  
2ND ELDER: The Doctor may go away to fetch an army of human beings and a fleet
of spaceships.  
1ST ELDER: This is a terrible picture you paint. Do you mistrust them as much
as all that?  
2ND ELDER: I do not trust them as much as you, so I advise caution.  
1ST ELDER: I will think of your advice, and weigh up the matter.

**[Laboratory]**

(John is in a chair, with a metal crown of electrodes on his head)  
SCIENTIST: How may I help the city Administrator?  
ADMINISTRATOR: Why is this creature here?  
SCIENTIST: We are clearing his mind.  
ADMINISTRATOR: On whose orders?  
SCIENTIST: The First Elder.  
ADMINISTRATOR: It would have been better to kill him than cure him, Scientist.  
2ND ELDER: Leave us.  
(The scientist leaves)  
2ND ELDER: Once again you question the voice of authority.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Sir, the Elders rule this planet while I am only responsible
for this city, yet I will do everything within my power to protect and defend
that city.  
2ND ELDER: Be careful your power is not taken from you.  
ADMINISTRATOR: These intruders threaten us all. This creature is being cured!  
2ND ELDER: Yes, we fulfil a promise.  
ADMINISTRATOR: At any moment you will put them in their ship and let them go!
This is madness!  
2ND ELDER: One more insolent word from you and I shall ask that your collar of
office be taken from you. This man is to be cured. As for the other one.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Which other one?  
2ND ELDER: The one known as Ian Chesterton.  
ADMINISTRATOR: These are absurd names they all have. None of them wear any
signs of authority or badges of position. How are we to distinguish them? What
is wrong with the other one?  
2ND ELDER: He has caught the disease. Their commander, the Doctor, believes
our water supply is to blame.  
ADMINISTRATOR: What a brilliant scheme. Evil, but undoubtedly brilliant.  
2ND ELDER: Explain.  
ADMINISTRATOR: To attack our confidence in one of the necessities. There is
nothing wrong with our water supply. Nothing at all. This is a trick to get us
at their mercy.  
JOHN: Evil. Evil.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Do you see? Even this half-broken creature here admits the
truth.  
2ND ELDER: I must warn the First Elder.  
(Second Elder leaves)  
JOHN: No, no. Evil is here.  
ADMINISTRATOR: He cannot hear you. Your mind is closed by the machine. Your
voice is not believed.  
JOHN: You are my enemy.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I am the enemy of all Earth creatures, and any Sensorite who
defends them shall be swept away.  
JOHN: I must warn them of your evil. I must. I must!  
(John passes out)  
ADMINISTRATOR: Your brain is too weak to harm me.  
CAROL: How's John? Oh, I am sorry. I thought you were one of the scientists.  
ADMINISTRATOR: You can see my collar of office. I am the city Administrator.  
CAROL: Yes, I'm sorry, but when your backs are turned, it's very difficult to
see. I don't know what we'd all do if you changed your badges and sashes. We
wouldn't be able to tell you apart.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I have never thought of that.  
CAROL: John?

**[Reception room]**

(The Doctor's anger is making the First Elder cringe. Ian is on a sheepskin
covered couch nearby)  
DOCTOR: But he'll die!  
1ST ELDER: No noise! I beg of you.  
SUSAN: Why can't you make up your mind?  
DOCTOR: Just look at that young man. I've done all I can for him at the
moment. Given him salt and water. He's been coughing his heart out. I must
have chemicals and equipment. His death will be your fault, and yours alone.  
1ST ELDER: Very well, I  
2ND ELDER: Sir.  
(They commune telepathically)  
DOCTOR: What is it now?  
SUSAN: I can't hear very clearly. Their minds aren't open to me.  
DOCTOR: Do you really mean you can hear their minds talking, Susan?  
SUSAN: Yes, but it's not very distinct.  
1ST ELDER: Doctor, I cannot allow you to go to your ship.  
DOCTOR: Don't set yourself against me.  
1ST ELDER: There is a laboratory here. You may prove your poisoned water
theory there, or not at all.  
DOCTOR: You fool!  
(The Sensorites cringe)  
SUSAN: Grandfather, please! They think you're attacking them. We're sorry.
There's so much about your planet we don't understand.  
DOCTOR: It's inhuman.  
SUSAN: Grandfather.  
DOCTOR: Just monstrous.  
SUSAN: We didn't mean to use sound as a weapon. We didn't even know sound hurt
you.  
1ST ELDER> Very well, but please be careful in future. I wish to see regular
reports on the progress of this theory.  
(The First Elder leaves, Second Elder stays)  
DOCTOR: Theory?  
SUSAN: Grandfather, please!  
DOCTOR: I know we have no alternative, but such outrageous behaviour! Oh,
forget it, child. Now, I want you to stay here and act as nurse. Watch his
pulse rate, will you, and let me know immediately  
IAN: Doctor. What's happened to me?  
DOCTOR: How are you feeling?  
IAN: My throat's still sore.  
DOCTOR: Any pains elsewhere?  
IAN: No, but I feel very giddy.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, you just rest there quietly. Yes, we'll let him have all
the crystal water he wants, and if his breathing gets febrile, artificial
respiration. Now, sir. Your laboratory. And I only hope there's time to save
him.

**[Courtyard]**

ENGINEER: The Second Elder has given the firing pin to the Chief of Warriors.
I saw him.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Then the disintegrator is no longer of any use to us. How can
we destroy these crea  
(First Elder enters)  
ENGINEER: Shh.  
1ST ELDER: I have placed our laboratory at the disposal of the man called the
Doctor. See to it that he is given every cooperation.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Yes, sir.  
(First Elder leaves)  
ADMINISTRATOR: Your witness. These creatures are defeating us with smiles and
gentle words. Our leaders listen and agree. Soon we shall all be slaves.  
ENGINEER: What can we do?  
ADMINISTRATOR: Bring the Second Elder to me. Alone. The girl Carol gave me an
idea. How would you recognise the Second Elder at a distance?  
ENGINEER: By the sash he wears.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Bring the Second Elder to me at the disintegrator room.  
ENGINEER: Yes.  
ADMINISTRATOR: We must match cunning with cunning.

**[Laboratory]**

(Lots of twirly glass and rubber hoses on a table, and John safely out of
sight over on the right of our screen)  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I have to say, very comprehensive. Now, gentlemen, time is
not on our side. I believe your people have been dying because there is
atropine poison in the aqueduct water. Now, allow me. I've made a few notes
here which might interest you. Now these are the symptoms. Atropine causes
dilation of the blood vessels. Temperature rises and pulse rate becomes very
rapid. A rash may appear. The mouth and throat both become extremely dry. Now
what we have to do is this, gentlemen. Isolate the poison and then prescribe
the remedy.  
SCIENTIST 2: We give you our assistance.  
DOCTOR: Good.  
SCIENTIST: Although we have tested the water already.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well then we must try again.  
SCIENTIST: Over here is a sample of the aqueduct water.  
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. You know, a strange thing here is, not all your people died.  
SCIENTIST 2: Three in every ten. Last year it was two in every ten.  
DOCTOR: Yes, of course some may be able to resist it or perhaps some of the
water is good.  
SCIENTIST: But all the water is the same.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but surely from different outlets?  
SCIENTIST 2: There are ten districts in the city, but only one source.  
DOCTOR: Well, gentlemen, there's a poison at work here. I know the signs. Now
what you must do is to test samples from each and every district. Where did
that come from?  
SCIENTIST 2: This palace. It is district ten.  
DOCTOR: I see. Well now, I suggest that you sample that bottle, and mark it
and then start keeping records. And there's not a moment to lose. And
remember, I want samples from all the outlying districts. It's imperative.  
(And so the testing starts, as Ian becomes delirious. District after district
comes back negative for contaminants, until - )  
DOCTOR: This one! I've found it. And just as I suspected, atropine poison.
That's why your people have been dying off.  
SCIENTIST: But why were some of the districts negative?  
DOCTOR: Because it varies from place to place, and when you made your tests,
you didn't discover it.

**[Reception room]**

1ST ELDER: And can the Doctor discover a cure?  
2ND ELDER: He says so. Caffeine citrate is the antidote.  
1ST ELDER: Remarkable man. Remarkable.  
2ND ELDER: I have an appointment, then I shall return to the laboratory.  
1ST ELDER: Give my Doctor the congratulations on the progress.  
(Second Elder leaves, and First Elder goes over to Ian's sickbed or couch)  
SUSAN: He's much easier now.  
1ST ELDER: The Doctor has had some success. A remedy will be available soon.  
SUSAN: Thank goodness. Ian. Ian, you're going to be all right.

**[Disintegrator room]**

ADMINISTRATOR: They are coming now.  
(Second Elder enters)  
2ND ELDER: Why are we meeting here?  
ADMINISTRATOR: Hold him!  
(Two Sensorites grab the Second Elder)  
2ND ELDER: You will be punished for this offence.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I advise you to answer my questions. Your family group is also
in my power.  
2ND ELDER: What have you done with them?  
ADMINISTRATOR: Nothing so far. Has the Doctor completed his experiments?  
2ND ELDER: Yes.  
ADMINISTRATOR: And the antidote is to be given to the young man Ian?  
2ND ELDER: Yes.  
ADMINISTRATOR: And then to our people who are also ill?  
2ND ELDER: Yes.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I do not believe there is an antidote. The young man pretends
to be ill. The Doctor pretends to cure him, and then he will kill us all with
the poison he has made.  
2ND ELDER: That's not true! Our scientists have worked with him. They say  
ADMINISTRATOR: Silence! You are a traitor to our people. You are not worthy to
wear this.  
(He pulls off the Elder's sash, and his own collar, then puts the sash on
himself)  
2ND ELDER: What are you going to do?  
ADMINISTRATOR: This so-called antidote must be stopped. The people will obey
their Elders.  
2ND ELDER: The First Elder has approved the antidote.  
ADMINISTRATOR: And yet it will be stopped. The Second Elder will suppress it.  
2ND ELDER: I will not!  
ADMINISTRATOR: I wear your sash of office. Who is to know that I am not the
Second Elder now? Bind him. Keep him here.

**[Laboratory]**

CAROL: You're tired out, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but a happy tiredness, my dear. How's our friend?  
CAROL: Oh, he's improving, but he still seems to go back sometimes to that old
state of confusion.  
DOCTOR: Yes, you must expect that. Ah, my friend. You've prepared the
antidote?  
SCIENTIST: Yes, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Splendid. Now I think we ought to start making this in large
quantities. Will you please see that that goes to the First Elder's room? Give
it to my granddaughter, Susan.  
SCIENTIST: I'll send a messenger immediately.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well now we shall soon be off this planet.  
CAROL: When John's cured. There's no quick antidote for him.  
DOCTOR: Oh, courage, my dear. Courage. Of course, I'm rather baffled with this
atropine poison, because it only seems to appear in one part of the city or
rather one reservoir at a time. It's curious.  
CAROL: Yes, but you've discovered an antidote now.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, that's a cure all right, but then why cure something when we
can stamp it out, hmm?  
JOHN: Enemies.  
DOCTOR: What's that, my friend?  
JOHN: Plotting.  
CAROL: He's more coherent now, but it's as if he was living in a dream world
where he's surrounded by enemies.  
JOHN: Enemies. Yes. Making plots.  
DOCTOR: I don't know. He might be more lucid, you know, than one should
imagine. Now I'm going off on an expedition, and I want you to take note of
what he says.  
JOHN: Listen to John.  
DOCTOR: You see, he knows his name. Now you stay with him. I think he's
getting better, and I'm sure you're going to have a great future between you,
later on. Now, after my little exploration...  
CAROL: Where are you going, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: I'm going to find the First Elder, Scientist, rather, and we're going
off on an exploration. It isn't dangerous, of course. But when I have solved
my problem I'm sure we shall all be out of trouble.

**[Courtyard]**

ENGINEER: Supposing your disguise is seen through?  
ADMINISTRATOR: You must remember that the First and Second Elders are well
known only to those in powerful positions. The people see them rarely, and
mostly at a distance.  
SCIENTIST: I greet the Second Elder.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I return your greeting, Scientist.  
(The Scientist starts to leave)  
ENGINEER: Success!  
ADMINISTRATOR: Yes. Scientist, come here. Where are you going?  
SCIENTIST: The man from the spaceship, the Doctor, has found a cure. Poison
was in our water supply. Here is the antidote.  
ADMINISTRATOR: You take it to the young Earth creature who is ill?  
SCIENTIST: Yes.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Give it to me. I will deliver it. Return to your laboratory.  
(The Scientist leaves)  
ENGINEER: If this Doctor has found a cure  
ADMINISTRATOR: It's a trick. They are trying to poison us all. I will prove it
to you. They say without the antidote the young man will die. I say he will
live because he is pretending.  
(And he throws the vial to the floor, where it smashes)  
ADMINISTRATOR: This will prove it one way or the other.

**[Reception room]**

SUSAN: Why hasn't the antidote arrived yet?  
1ST ELDER: I do not know.  
IAN: Doctor must have run into a snag, Susan. It's not always possible to do
these things at the snap of a finger.  
SUSAN: I'm going to find out why. May I do that?  
1ST ELDER: Yes. I will have you conducted to the laboratory. Go with this
servant, and give my respects to the senior scientist.

**[Aqueduct]**

SCIENTIST: Here is the entrance to the aqueduct.  
DOCTOR: It's very gloomy.  
SCIENTIST: All our attempts to light it end in failure for one reason or
another.  
DOCTOR: But that must make it rather difficult for you. The Sensorites dislike
darkness, don't they?  
SCIENTIST: We avoid this place. We have no reason to go down to the aqueduct
anyway.  
DOCTOR: Well, it may be because you've neglected it that the water's become
poisoned.  
SCIENTIST: Shall we return now?  
DOCTOR: Return? I don't want to return. I haven't just come here for a look.
I'm going in there.  
SCIENTIST: No! You must not.  
DOCTOR: And why?  
SCIENTIST: You will not be able to see.  
DOCTOR: Oh, but I have a torch.  
SCIENTIST: There are monsters in there.  
DOCTOR: Indeed? Are there?  
SCIENTIST: Yes, we've heard them.  
DOCTOR: And not seen them?  
SCIENTIST: No, but they are there. The noise is terrifying.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think you should return to the laboratory. I shall be all
right. Leave it to me, will you? I assure you.  
(The Scientist leaves)  
DOCTOR: How very convenient. Yes. Noise and darkness. The two things the
Sensorites dislike. There's more in this than meets the eye.

**[Reception room]**

(Susan has given Ian an injection)  
1ST ELDER: I cannot understand why the Second Elder did not bring the antidote
here.  
SUSAN: Well I managed to get some more. That's all that really matters. Thank
you. Now, no running around for a bit, Ian.  
IAN: Yes, Matron. Actually, I'm quite happy to stay here. I feel as though
someone has given me a good going over with a hammer.  
(The Scientist enters)  
SCIENTIST: I attend you, sire.  
1ST ELDER: My orders have not been complied with. I asked for regular reports.
Where have you been?  
SCIENTIST: Forgive me, sir. The Doctor asked me to take him to the aqueduct.  
1ST ELDER: Why?  
SCIENTIST: He said that that was where the root of the trouble lay. I couldn't
stop him. He sent me away and said he was going in.  
1ST ELDER: Did you not warn him?  
SCIENTIST: Yes, but he took no notice.  
SUSAN: Warn him of what?  
1ST ELDER: The aqueduct. It's inhabited by monsters.  
IAN: What? Why did you let him go down there?  
SCIENTIST: I couldn't stop him.  
IAN: We must get him out. Haven't you got someone you can send down there to
help him?  
1ST ELDER: The caverns are dark. We are helpless.  
SUSAN: Take some light with you then.  
1ST ELDER: Other expeditions have tried and failed. Most of our men do not
return, and those that do speak of terrible things.  
IAN: Well, I'll have to go myself and  
SUSAN: No you won't.  
IAN: We can't stay here, Susan.  
SUSAN: You're too ill, Ian.  
IAN: I'm not that ill.  
SUSAN: All right. We'll need someone to show us the way.  
1ST ELDER: I beg you to change your minds. You cannot save your friend.  
IAN: We'll never know till we try, will we?  
(The Scientist leads them out, Ian leaning on Susan)  
1ST ELDER: These people have fine qualities. The Second Elder and I have
misjudged them, and I will tell him so.  
(He uses his telepathy device)

**[Disintegrator room]**

2ND ELDER: I hear you, sir. I hear you.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Someone's mind is in communication with yours? Whose is it? The
First Elder?  
2ND ELDER: Give me the mind transmitter.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Do you think I'm a fool? You can hear, but you cannot speak
your mind without this. What is he saying to you?  
2ND ELDER: I refuse to tell you.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Think of your family group. Its safety depends upon you.  
2ND ELDER: It is the First Elder. He says we have misjudged the human beings
from Earth. He's saying the one called the Doctor has gone down into the
viaduct, that the young man and the girl called Susan have gone to rescue him.
He is asking why I don't reply.  
ADMINISTRATOR: No one, no one can come out of the aqueduct alive. The one
known as the Doctor is near death. The other two approach death. I see victory
for all my plans!

**[Aqueduct]**

IAN: Is this it?  
SCIENTIST: Yes. Take this. It's a radio-electric light.  
SUSAN: Thank you. Ian, how do you feel? If you don't want to go any further,
just say.  
IAN: No, I'm fine. Come on.

**[Cavern]**

(The Doctor has found something)  
DOCTOR: Is it? Yes. I thought so. Atropa Belladonna. Deadly Nightshade.  
(Over in the darkness, something roars)

__**Episode Five - Kidnap**__

**[Cavern]**

SUSAN: What is it, Ian?  
IAN: We must find him.  
SUSAN: Are you all right?  
IAN: Yes.  
SUSAN: Lean on me.  
DOCTOR [OC]: Keep away!  
SUSAN: Grandfather!  
IAN: He's unconscious. Here, help me to get him out of here.  
SUSAN: Look at the state he's in.  
(The back of the Doctor's jacket is in shreds)  
IAN: Don't worry about that. Collect up his things. We don't want to hang
around here. It's going away.  
SUSAN: Ian, what do you think this is?  
IAN: I don't know. Part of an old lighting system I suppose. Don't worry about
that now. Let's get him out of here before that thing comes back.

**[Laboratory]**

CAROL: Can't just give up. You know the aqueduct. Surely you can help them in
some way?  
SCIENTIST: I regret it is impossible.  
1ST ELDER: You have no conception of what extreme sound does to us. It stuns
the brain and paralyses the nerves.  
SCIENTIST: And in the darkness we're helpless anyway. Our warriors will be
more of a hindrance than a help.  
CAROL: Is there no hope for them, then?  
1ST ELDER: Let us speak of your companion, the man John. The senior scientist
told me that he's making excellent progress. The final treatment will be given
today.  
CAROL: Thank you.  
1ST ELDER: You are sad for the friends you have lost. Rejoice for the friend
who is being returned to you. Scientist, you will report to me on your
progress.  
SCIENTIST: I will, sir.  
CAROL: Those poor people.

**[Aqueduct]**

SUSAN: Just look at this coat. It's ruined.  
IAN: Those look like claw marks. Strange they didn't reach your skin.  
DOCTOR: Yes, strange indeed when you realise that I was at the mercy of that
creature. It was so dark in there it was invisible and it knocked me to the
ground.  
IAN: Are you sure you didn't see it?  
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Something hit me under the heart and it was most
unpleasant. It was a good thing I sent you that antidote. Otherwise I might
have been in a much worse state than I was.  
SUSAN: We didn't get the antidote. I had to go all the way back to the
laboratory and get some more.  
DOCTOR: What?  
IAN: Yes. Surrounded by enemies.  
DOCTOR: Then it's true. True. The water, and those monsters in there, and now
it appears that there's someone among the Sensorites that bear us ill-will.
That's two separate enemies.  
IAN: Don't you mean three?  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. No, don't mistake me. The water and those monsters are
distinctly connected. I've more or less solved that problem. But this
Sensorite who's against us is a much greater danger. Now I suggest we go back
and try and find out which one it is.  
IAN: Yes.  
(A Sensorite watches them leave)

**[Laboratory]**

JOHN: Treachery.  
CAROL: He keeps on saying the same things.  
JOHN: A plot. I must warn you.  
CAROL: I'm sure he's discovered something or he's overheard someone and he's
trying to tell us.  
JOHN: Yes. Tell you. Warn you.  
CAROL: You see?  
SCIENTIST: It must be illusion. Our society is based upon trust. Treason or
secret plotting is impossible.  
CAROL: That's rather a sweeping statement.  
SCIENTIST: But why should a Sensorite make any secret plans against anyone? We
have the perfect society. All are contented.  
CAROL: Some people always want more than others.  
SCIENTIST: That is a human value, surely.  
CAROL: Perhaps. Rest quietly now, John. It won't be long. (to Scientist) You
were trying to explain something to me earlier.  
SCIENTIST: We discovered long ago that in our brains there were many different
compartments or divisions. When fear or alarm is at work, that section becomes
open, a veil is lifted. Do you understand?  
CAROL: Yes.  
SCIENTIST: That is what happened to the man John. But the veil will not lower
itself. Thus he is constantly afraid. Even when he's at peace, when he's
asleep for example, the body says one thing, the brain the other. That's his
condition, utter confusion.  
CAROL: And this treatment you're giving him is in order to close down that
veil?  
SCIENTIST: Yes. Not permanently, of course, or he would step into danger
without concern. The veil must function normally again.  
CAROL: It's rather like an eyelid, isn't it. These shutters over my eyes.  
SCIENTIST: Yes. To see all the time is not a good thing. Now, we must begin.  
CAROL: Yes. I'll be here all the time, John.  
JOHN: Carol.  
CAROL: Yes, that's right.  
JOHN: I must tell you, but it's so difficult.  
CAROL: Soon you'll be able to tell me all you've found out.

**[Disintegrator room]**

(The Second Elder is being untied, but the Administrator still wears his sash
of office)  
ENGINEER: There is no mistake, City Administrator. I saw the Doctor and the
other two leave the aqueduct. I hear them talking. They are suspicious.  
ADMINISTRATOR: The creature John is nearly cured. He too can speak against me.
We are nearly surrounded by our enemies.  
2ND ELDER: You will be uncovered as a traitor and a criminal.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Silence.  
ENGINEER: What are we to do?  
ADMINISTRATOR: These Earth creatures are working to destroy the Sensorite
nation. Their pleasant smile conceals sharp teeth, their soft words hide
deadly threats.  
2ND ELDER: Please, don't listen.  
ADMINISTRATOR: And who opposes them? Weak and timid creatures like this Second
Elder here, whose sash I wear.  
2ND ELDER: Thief.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Whimpering betrayer of our people. Coward! I should imprison
you in some room wherein no light can shine, and fill that room with noise!  
2ND ELDER: Do it, then. Finish with me.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Not yet. Remember, I hold your family group. First you shall do
something for me. Summon the Senior Warrior with your mind transmitter. Tell
him to bring the firing key of the disintegrator and meet you in the forecourt
of the palace.  
2ND ELDER: No.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Remember your family group.  
2ND ELDER: Very well.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I shall be listening. Stand over him. Stab him if he sends his
mind to anyone other than the Senior Warrior. Now send this thought. Senior
Warrior, this is the Second Elder. Go on! Send it! Good. He's answering. Tell
him to bring the firing key and meet you in the courtyard of the Palace of the
Elders. That is enough. I shall keep the appointment you have made. The Senior
Warrior shall know me by the sash I wear. Your sash. Guard him well.  
(The Administrator leaves)  
2ND ELDER: Why do you listen to him? Why do you follow him?  
ENGINEER: He will not betray our people, nor surrender our planet.  
2ND ELDER: He will bring us all down. All of us.  
ENGINEER: Be silent!  
2ND ELDER: All of us.

**[Courtyard]**

DOCTOR: You've been exerting yourself, boy, and naturally you're weak.  
SUSAN: He can rest now though, can't he, Grandfather. We'll force him to.  
IAN: I wish you two'd stop fussing over me.  
DOCTOR: Now, now, you must do as you're told, and that is that. Isn't that one
of the Elders?  
SUSAN: It's the Second Elder. He's only got one sash.  
(They see the Warrior hand the key over to the 'Elder')  
DOCTOR: Take it easy. I want a word with him. I say, you, sir. Sir, I'd like a
word with you.  
(The Doctor follows him off, and the Warrior leaves in the opposite direction)  
SUSAN: It's a funny place down here, isn't it?  
IAN: What about up there? I wonder how Barbara's getting on?  
SUSAN: I wish she were down here with us.  
IAN: I wish we were up there in the Tardis and away from here. Still, I know
what you mean. Hey, why don't we ask the First Elder if Barbara can come down
and join us.  
(The Doctor returns)  
SUSAN: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Most extraordinary. He ran away from me!  
SUSAN: (laughs) That must have looked funny. Flip, flap, flip, flap.  
DOCTOR: I can assure you he was very mobile, my child. Come along, let's get
into the First Elder's room. Come along.

**[Disintegrator room]**

ADMINISTRATOR: Why have you not retied his hands? (the Engineer obeys) Now,
now I have the power.  
(The Second Elder shrugs off the Engineer and takes the key from the
Administrator. He then bends it against the edge of the console)  
ADMINISTRATOR: Stop him, you fool!  
(There's a brief struggle, and the Engineer knocks out the Second Elder)  
ADMINISTRATOR: He has broken it!  
ENGINEER: The Second Elder is dead!  
ADMINISTRATOR: The only other firing key is in the possession of the First
Elder!  
ENGINEER: Then we shall have to give up. We must leave the city, hide in the
mountains.  
ADMINISTRATOR: No, no. Don't be foolish. The death of the Second Elder can
help us, not condemn us. We must act quickly. You know the man called the
Doctor?  
ENGINEER: Yes.  
ADMINISTRATOR: You can describe him?  
ENGINEER: Yes.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Good. Then I will outline my plan to you.

**[Reception room]**

1ST ELDER: Yes, I have asked questions. The first supply of the antidote you
sent, Doctor, was intercepted by my Second Elder, my advisor. He has since
disappeared.  
SUSAN: We saw him in the courtyard.  
1ST ELDER: His behaviour is a mystery.  
DOCTOR: Yes, strange indeed, sir. I tried to talk to him and he ran away.  
IAN: Yes. You still won't accept that he's done something bad.  
1ST ELDER: I cannot. I selected him for office, but it is not pride which
makes me defend my choice. I know that Sensorite. I trust him.  
SUSAN: And yet you can't explain his actions.  
1ST ELDER: A mystery does not mean that he is guilty.  
(A Sensorite enters with a cloak)  
1ST ELDER: For the Doctor.  
DOCTOR: My dear sir. That's most civil of you. I ruined my jacket down in the
aqueduct, but of course I have others on my ship. Thank you.  
SUSAN: Very smart.  
DOCTOR: Beau Brummell always said I looked better in a cloak.  
(The Administrator enters, wearing his proper collar)  
1ST ELDER: The City Administrator wishes to speak?  
ADMINISTRATOR: Urgently, sir. A story has been put before me that you should
hear.  
1ST ELDER: Now?  
ADMINISTRATOR: It concerns the Second Elder and these Earth creatures.  
1ST ELDER: Very well.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Enter.  
(The Warrior and the Engineer enter)  
ADMINISTRATOR: Tell your story.  
ENGINEER: Sir, the Second Elder is dead. He was killed in the courtyard. I saw
the man who killed him.  
1ST ELDER: The man?  
ENGINEER: Yes, sir. It was the man called the Doctor.  
SUSAN: That's not true!  
ADMINISTRATOR: The Senior Warrior here has evidence. Speak.  
WARRIOR: I met the Second Elder in the courtyard, as he ordered me to. I gave
him the firing key of the disintegrator. Then I saw the Doctor go after the
Second Elder.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I did that, but I didn't kill him.  
ENGINEER: I saw you. You wrestled for possession of the firing key.  
ADMINISTRATOR: There is the firing key, bent as though in a struggle.  
ENGINEER: And finally, when the Second Elder resisted, you took an object from
inside your coat, and struck him down and killed him.  
1ST ELDER: This is a grave charge.  
IAN: But obviously untrue, sir.  
1ST ELDER: Why?  
IAN: How did you recognise the Doctor?  
ENGINEER: His hair is different.  
IAN: Yes.  
ENGINEER: So are his clothes.  
IAN: Oh, yes, his clothes. You say that you saw him take an object from his
pocket.  
ENGINEER: Yes.  
IAN: You could see quite clearly? You're sure it was from his coat pocket?  
ENGINEER: I tell you yes! All the Sensorites know the Doctor by his  
(The Doctor stands, and poses grandly in his cloak)  
IAN: The Doctor's coat is outside the aqueduct. You are lying.  
ENGINEER: Then, then it was a cloak he was wearing! Yes, it was. I'm sure of
it now. It was a cloak.  
1ST ELDER: I have just presented the Doctor with that cloak. Your story is a
tissue of lies. Remove him.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I shall interview you myself.  
(The Warrior leads the Engineer away)  
ADMINISTRATOR: Sir, you must forgive his wild accusation, but I felt his story
should be brought before you.  
1ST ELDER: You acted correctly. What can have possessed my advisor?  
ADMINISTRATOR: The Second Elder, sir, was always opposed to our visitors.
Perhaps he stole the firing key in order to attack them with the
disintegrator?  
SUSAN: I bet he stole our antidote too. He was our enemy.  
1ST ELDER: A sad matter. But since he has deceived us, my sympathy shall not
be wasted. As to his replacement.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I have his sash of office here, so that you may select a new
advisor immediately.  
IAN: Perhaps he ought not to look further than this room.  
SUSAN: Yes. If he thought he got promotion because of us, he'd be a useful
ally.  
DOCTOR: Just what I was thinking. Yes, of course, we have no wish to interfere
in your affairs, but the City Administrator appears to have all the
qualifications.  
1ST ELDER: Well, what do you say? Can you accept such power, such authority?  
ADMINISTRATOR: My only ambition is to serve the Sensorite nation.  
1ST ELDER: Then accept this sash. I make you my advisor. From now on you will
be know as the Second Elder, second only on the Sensphere to me. And once this
order is made, only a betrayal of trust can set it aside.  
(The Administrator takes of his neck band, and the First Elder puts the sash
on him. But I'll still call him Administrator)  
1ST ELDER: My new advisor and I have much to discuss. You will excuse us?  
DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. My companions and I will pay a visit to the man John,
and note his progress.  
SUSAN: Oh, you were going to ask about Barbara.  
IAN: I don't think this is quite the moment. I'll ask later.  
SUSAN: All right.  
IAN: Oh, and congratulations.  
ADMINISTRATOR: When you address one of the Elders, you call him sir.

**[Laboratory]**

(John no longer wears the contraption on his head)  
SCIENTIST: Now we shall know.  
CAROL: John. John?  
JOHN: Such a headache.  
SCIENTIST: That will go quickly.  
JOHN: It's easing now. Carol. You're crying.  
CAROL: I'm all right, really I am. It's just that I haven't seen you smile for
so long.  
JOHN: But we can't have you crying, can we. I'm all right now. I'm all right.
That John's gone quite suddenly. Was it awful?  
CAROL: All that matters is how you are now.  
JOHN: What have I been like all this time?  
CAROL: Don't you remember?  
JOHN: Some things, but most of it seems a sort of grey cloud. I just remember
that it seems a very long time.  
CAROL: Yes. Oh, John, I can't tell you how I feel. How glad.  
SCIENTIST: It is indeed a time of happiness for both of you.  
CAROL: Oh, this is the scientist who cured you.  
JOHN: Then I have a lot to thank you for.  
(He holds out his hand)  
SCIENTIST: What do you ask for?  
JOHN: We have a custom of shaking hands with someone, in friendship.  
SCIENTIST: Then, I accept.  
(The Doctor, Ian and Susan enter)  
DOCTOR: Well, well. What a happy scene.  
SUSAN: Do you remember us?  
JOHN: I remember you distinctly.  
IAN: Well I'm Ian, and this is the Doctor, Susan's grandfather.  
DOCTOR: I'm glad to see you don't bear a grudge against the Sensorites for the
past.  
CAROL: All that matters now is the present.  
DOCTOR: Splendid. Now sir, the antidote. I wonder if  
(They move off out of shot)  
JOHN: I remember another girl.  
SUSAN: Oh, that's Barbara. We both found you. She's up in the spaceship.  
JOHN: Oh I see.  
SUSAN: John, all the time you were ill, you were trying to warn us of
something.  
JOHN: There was a Sensorite who was dangerous. I must try and remember what
happened.  
(The Administrator sneaks in quietly)  
JOHN: I know there was a plot. Yes, that's it. Someone was plotting against
you  
ADMINISTRATOR: And this Sensorite. Can you identify him?  
JOHN: No.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Is he in this room?  
JOHN: No. There was something particularly odd about his clothes, I remember.
Exactly what  
ADMINISTRATOR: Yes, it must have been the Sensorite who just died.  
SUSAN: Yes. I suppose it must.  
ADMINISTRATOR: The First Elder wishes to talk to the Doctor. You will inform
him.  
SUSAN: All right.  
(The Administrator leaves)  
JOHN: He's not very friendly.  
SUSAN: Well, he's only just become Second Elder. I should think he's trying
out his new authority.  
CAROL: I wouldn't like to cross him.  
(Across the lab)  
DOCTOR: And what is this little collection of things here?  
SCIENTIST: Left behind by the humans that were killed in the spaceship
explosion.  
DOCTOR: I see.  
IAN: Oh, look at these, Doctor. Family snapshots. Look.  
DOCTOR: Yes, now just a moment. This is rather important. This is a rough plan
of the aqueduct.  
SCIENTIST: One of the human beings was very interested in the aqueduct.  
DOCTOR: Is that so?  
SUSAN: Grandfather, the First Elder wants to talk to you.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. I have a couple of questions for him.  
SCIENTIST: This is only a sketch. I can let you have a plan in detail if you
need.  
DOCTOR: Very valuable, very valuable.  
SCIENTIST: The City Administrator can have no objection.  
SUSAN: The City Administrator! Of course!  
DOCTOR: What about him? What about him?  
SUSAN: John, you know you said that there was something odd about the
Sensorite? Was it his collar?  
JOHN: Collar. Yes, that was it.  
SUSAN: You see, the City Administrator. He was our enemy.  
IAN: What, the one who's just been made the Second Elder?  
SUSAN: Yes! When John was ill, he must have given himself away.  
IAN: Yes. He was certainly pretty odd with me.  
DOCTOR: If this is true what you say, Susan, there's trouble ahead for us.
That Sensorite has power now.  
IAN: Yes, and the worst of it is, we gave him the power.

**[Disintegrator room]**

ADMINISTRATOR: You were not to know that the Doctor had changed his coat. I
managed your escape from prison and that is all that matters.  
ENGINEER: I am grateful, but what use am I now?  
ADMINISTRATOR: I still have a task for you. You are accomplished in mechanical
matters.  
ENGINEER: Yes. What do you want me to do?  
ADMINISTRATOR: (holding weapons) Can you remove the mechanisms but leave them
looking perfect from the outside?  
ENGINEER: Yes.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Then see to it.

**[Reception room]**

IAN: It's no use telling him stories about the Second Elder, Doctor. We've got
to give him proof.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I quite agree. And the only way to get that proof is to go back
into the aqueduct. What about Susan?  
IAN: Look, why don't you ask the First Elder if we can have Barbara down here
again.  
DOCTOR: A good idea.  
1ST ELDER: Gentlemen. Be seated.  
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you.  
IAN: Well, sir, the Doctor and I have discussed this poison business, and we
are convinced that your water supply is being deliberately poisoned.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and what we propose to do, sir, is to go down into the aqueduct,
find your enemies and stop them.  
1ST ELDER: Very well. But you will take light with you, and such arms as we
can provide.  
DOCTOR: Thank you. We're making progress.  
IAN: Barbara.  
DOCTOR: I wonder, sir, could I ask you a small favour?  
1ST ELDER: Ask it.  
DOCTOR: We have a companion, a young lady, on the ship. Is it possible for her
to be brought down here in the Sensphere?  
1ST ELDER: It will be arranged.  
DOCTOR: Splendid, sir. Splendid.  
WARRIOR: I have brought the weapons, sir.  
1ST ELDER: Ah. Thank you. Warrior. Instruct them as to their use.

**[Courtyard]**

ADMINISTRATOR: It's done. I have arranged that the useless weapons shall be
delivered to the humans. Hide yourself.  
(Engineer leaves)  
ADMINISTRATOR: What have you there?  
SCIENTIST: It is the plan of the aqueduct, sir. The Doctor asked for it.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Give it to me. I will deliver it. Return to your duties.  
SCIENTIST: Thank you, sir.  
(Scientist leaves)  
ADMINISTRATOR: The plan of the aqueduct. (Engineer reappears) Quickly, change
some of the routes on this and see that a messenger delivers it to the Doctor.  
ENGINEER: It shall be done.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Now, not only shall they go down into the aqueduct with useless
armaments, but they will be hopelessly lost as well.

**[Reception room]**

(They are looking at the weapons)  
IAN: Very simple to use, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Careful.  
WARRIOR: The range is considerable. The ray paralyses up to a distance of
thirty yards.  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, splendid. And remember, dear boy, that I shall be standing
nearly next to you. I've never liked weapons at any time. However, they're
handy little things. Tell me, how long does this paralysis last?  
WARRIOR: One hour.  
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. These weapons are splendid, sir. And without a doubt
they'll help us to make success.  
1ST ELDER: And yet I do not envy you your adventure. I still wish I could
dissuade you.  
DOCTOR: Yes, and that brings me to another problem. My granddaughter, Susan.
She's bound to want to come with us.  
IAN: I don't think she ought to, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: No, I quite agree with you, my boy. We must go and not tell her, and
save any arguments. I wonder, sir, would you mind keeping a small secret until
we're well and truly away?  
1ST ELDER: Very well.  
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. After all, there's no danger now we have these
protectors, and I'm sure we can settle our little business in an hour or two.  
1ST ELDER: Ah, the map of the aqueduct.  
DOCTOR: Oh, excellent, excellent, my dear sir.  
IAN: Well, let's go and make an end of it, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Are you quite sure you're up to it?  
IAN: Quite.  
DOCTOR: Splendid. Lead the way. Sir.  
(Ian and the Doctor leave)  
WARRIOR: They are brave people, sir.  
1ST ELDER: We will not regret having known them.  
WARRIOR: I am glad they were innocent of killing the Second Elder, sir.  
1ST ELDER: Yes, I am still anxious about that. You realise that if they did
not kill my advisor, then he must have been killed by a Sensorite.  
WARRIOR: But who would do such a thing?  
1ST ELDER: Who, yes, but also I ask myself, why was it done?

**[Laboratory]**

(Food is laid out on low tables)  
JOHN: I've never felt so hungry.  
CAROL: Oh, won't it be wonderful when we get back to the Earth, John? How I
long for a thick, juicy steak.  
JOHN: Well, you'll just have to make do with a small juicy fruit.  
SUSAN: I wonder where they've gone to? I don't know what they're talking about
all this time.  
CAROL: Oh, I expect they're arranging for our return to the spaceship.  
(Ian and the Doctor arrive at the aqueduct and go into the tunnel to the
caverns)  
CAROL: I think I'll go over to the Palace of the Elders and try and hurry them
up.  
SUSAN: Oh, would you, Carol? Thank you.  
JOHN: Tell them I'm starving.  
CAROL: All right.  
(Carol leaves)  
SUSAN: John, I'm so happy that you're better now. So's Carol. Well, you can
see that for yourself.  
JOHN: Hmm. She's had a bad time. You know, I've a feeling that we'll both give
up space travelling when we get back to Earth.  
SUSAN: Oh, and get married?  
JOHN: She's all I really care about. Come on, let's eat. I'm tired of waiting.

(over in the Palace of the Elders Courtyard, Carol is grabbed from behind and
dragged off.)

__**Episode Six - A Desperate Venture**__

**[Disintegrator room]**

(Carol is dragged into the room and thrown to the floor)  
CAROL: Why are you doing this?  
ADMINISTRATOR: Pay attention to me. You write a letter to the man John.  
CAROL: I certainly will not.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Argument is a waste of time. Two of your friends have gone up
into the spaceship. They cannot help you. Two of the others have gone down
into the aqueduct.  
CAROL: The Doctor and Ian?  
ADMINISTRATOR: Yes. They cannot help you. The other two, the man John and the
girl Susan, are waiting innocently in the laboratory for you. Your party is
divided.  
CAROL: What do you want me to do?  
ADMINISTRATOR: Write to the man John. Tell him you have gone up into the
spaceship. In this way, he will not suspect your disappearance.  
CAROL: You can't force me to do this.  
ADMINISTRATOR: I can see that you stay alive. Your life means nothing to me.
Let us strike a bargain. You will write the note, I will see you live.  
CAROL: Very well.  
ENGINEER: Be wary of her. We cannot read her thoughts. She may  
ADMINISTRATOR: Be quiet. Write! You will stay here and guard her. She will
guarantee the success of all my plans.  
ENGINEER: And I shall be given high office?  
ADMINISTRATOR: I shall reward those who are faithful to me.  
(The note reads - John. Have gone to the spaceship. Carol.)

**[Reception room]**

(The note has been delivered)  
SUSAN: She couldn't have gone up to the spaceship.  
JOHN: Either you'd have seen her, or passed her on the way.  
SUSAN: Yes.  
BARBARA: She was obviously forced to write this. Whoever made her do it had no
idea that I was being brought down here.  
SUSAN: I bet the City Administrator had something to do with it.  
JOHN: But why kidnap her?  
BARBARA: I should think the why's fairly obvious, wouldn't you?  
JOHN: No, I don't think it is, Barbara. We're on good terms with the First
Elder, the Doctor's discovered an antidote for the poison and now he and Ian
are tracking down the cause of the trouble.  
BARBARA: Look, I've been away in the ship so maybe I can see things more
clearly. And I think we're being used by one of the Sensorites who wants to
gain power.  
SUSAN: You mean we're not just being attacked because we're from other
planets?  
BARBARA: No.  
1ST ELDER: I greet you.  
BARBARA: Thank you. Your friends expressed so much concern about you, I agreed
to have you brought down to the Sensphere.  
BARBARA: I'm afraid we must ask for your help.  
1ST ELDER: If I can.  
BARBARA: The Doctor and Ian are missing. Have you any idea where they are?
Well please tell me.  
1ST ELDER: There is a quality in human beings which intrigues me. Your concern
for each other. I assure you the two men are safe.  
BARBARA: You know where they are?  
1ST ELDER: Yes, but they asked me not to tell you what their plans were.  
SUSAN: That's Grandfather.  
BARBARA: Look, would you mind reading this letter?  
1ST ELDER: I gave no such order.  
BARBARA: No, we didn't think you did.  
1ST ELDER: Then why does your friend write what is not true?  
JOHN: Because someone made her write it.  
1ST ELDER: She could not travel without my ordering it. Where did you receive
this?  
SUSAN: It was given to us in the courtyard, where the arches are.  
JOHN: She is being held prisoner.  
1ST ELDER: Not by any Sensorite.  
JOHN: Of course she is!  
BARBARA: Quietly, John.  
SUSAN: Look, whatever she wrote this with wasn't dry. I put my thumb on it and
smudged it.  
1ST ELDER: And this is her writing?  
ALL: Yes.  
JOHN: And that smudge means that it was written just before we got it.  
1ST ELDER: Are you implying that your friend Carol is being held prisoner in
this palace? I assure you she is not.  
BARBARA: Well, are there any other buildings in the vicinity?  
1ST ELDER: None, except the disintegrator room.  
BARBARA: Where's that?  
1ST ELDER: Below the courtyard. It is rarely used now. I cannot unravel this
mystery, but I can see that it worries you. As to your other friends, I must
tell you. They have gone down into the aqueduct.  
SUSAN: What?  
1ST ELDER: They were given light and a good map. Also they were well armed.
They can be in no danger.

**[Cavern]**

IAN: There's no doubt about it, Doctor. The inside filament's been removed.
These weapons are useless.  
DOCTOR: It's only one of our troubles, dear boy. Look at this map. It's no
good to us. Look, all the lines have been altered. Somebody's been jiggering
around with it.  
IAN: We'll get out of here somehow, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Yes, in time. But have we got that time? Remember, we brought no food
with us and the only water available is that poisoned water out there with
Deadly Nightshade. A charming outlook.

**[Disintegrator room]**

CAROL: How long are you going to keep me here?  
ENGINEER: That is not for me to say.  
CAROL: Look, I've had nothing to eat and I'm very thirsty.  
ENGINEER: It is of no consequence.  
CAROL: But I wrote the letter.  
ENGINEER: But surely you did not think you would be released? All human
creatures are naive. They live while they have a purpose. As soon as that
purpose is achieved, then their life has no value left.  
(John tries to sneak in, but is spotted. The Engineer grabs a power lead)  
ENGINEER: Stop. I've only to touch her with this and she will die.  
JOHN: Don't be foolish. Put it down.  
ENGINEER: No Sensorite should be humbled before a human creature!  
(Carol pulls at the other end of the cable and the machine sparks and smokes)  
JOHN: Throw it down. Throw it down!  
(The Senior Warrior enters)  
JOHN: Take him to the First Elder.  
WARRIOR: I have already imprisoned you once. This time you will not escape.  
CAROL: Oh, John.

**[Reception room]**

1ST ELDER: This is very serious. That Sensorite was imprisoned on my order.
Now I find he has escaped and kidnapped one of the human beings.  
ADMINISTRATOR: He is a menace to our society.  
1ST ELDER: I agree.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Let him be punished.  
1ST ELDER: He shall be. We must also find who his accomplice is.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Ah. So you believe that another Sensorite is working with him?  
1ST ELDER: Obviously. He had to guard the girl Carol. Who then delivered the
letter she was forced to write?  
(Susan and Barbara enter)  
1ST ELDER: What I cannot tolerate is accusation. I must have clear and
definite proof.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Yes, sir. Clear and definite proof.  
1ST ELDER: Come in, my friends. You have been questioning this Sensorite who
has acted so treacherously?  
SUSAN: Yes, and what he told us is terrifying.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Has he identified his accomplice?  
BARBARA: No.  
SUSAN: Not yet.  
BARBARA: But he did say that the maps and the guns given to the Doctor and Ian
are quite useless.  
1ST ELDER: Outrageous. This Sensorite will die for this.  
SUSAN: Yes, but what about Grandfather and Ian?  
1ST ELDER: What can I say? Lost and unarmed in the aqueduct.  
BARBARA: I'm afraid that answer isn't good enough.  
ADMINISTRATOR: Do not be insolent to the First Elder!  
BARBARA: Look, you must decide who your friends are, and save them.  
1ST ELDER: There is nothing I can do.  
BARBARA: Is there an authentic map to the aqueduct?  
1ST ELDER: Yes.  
BARBARA: Well, if Susan and I can find a way to rescue them, will you help us?  
ADMINISTRATOR: I am suspicious of these creatures, sir. They ask too much.  
1ST ELDER: That other human being, the Doctor, he found a cure for our people.
He has placed his life in danger for the sake of the Sensorite nation. Yes, I
will give you all the help I can.

**[Tunnels]**

IAN: Well, whatever's out there hasn't attacked us yet.  
(Roaring sound)  
DOCTOR: Courage, my boy, both hands. Come on.  
IAN: Doctor. Something moved slightly up ahead of us.  
(The Doctor rolls up the map to make a club and gives it to Ian. He sneaks up
on something or someone but they get away)  
IAN: Doctor, it was a man! I know it was.  
DOCTOR: Are you sure?  
IAN: Yes. Look. This came away in the struggle.  
DOCTOR: It looks like a shoulder flash. I-N-E-E-R. Yes, just as I suspected.
It must be one of those survivors from the spaceship that exploded.  
IAN: Why should they come here?  
DOCTOR: To hide and poison the water.  
IAN: Yes, but why poison the water in the first place.  
DOCTOR: Let's go and ask him.

**[Reception room]**

(There's a scale model on a table)  
BARBARA: This is the entrance to the aqueduct.  
1ST ELDER: Yes.  
BARBARA: Tell me, do you think I could use one of your mind transmitters?  
1ST ELDER: You have my permission to try. But how will it help you?  
BARBARA: John and I will go down to the aqueduct, Susan will stay here and
direct us.  
SUSAN: Yes, then we can guide them both out.  
1ST ELDER: My scientists tell me that you do not require the use of our mind
transmitter.  
SUSAN: Well, I've always been able to read your mind, but only when you
allowed me to.  
1ST ELDER: Your mind must be finely tuned. The frequencies covering the
surface of the Sensphere are numerous. You must be able to break in on the
major ones.  
BARBARA: Well I can't. Do you mind if I try your invention?  
1ST ELDER: Hold it to your forehead and try to close your mind to everything
but the person to whom you wish to communicate. It is safe provided you do not
allow your concentration to slip.  
BARBARA: All right. Susan, let's try a little experiment.  
SUSAN: Right. (a moment of telepathy) The entrance to the aqueduct is there.  
BARBARA: It works. Well, there's no point in delaying. As soon as John and I
reach the entrance, you start directing us. All right?  
SUSAN: All right. Carol'll be here to help me.  
BARBARA: Good. Oh, by the way, I would like one of your warriors left here
with Susan.  
SUSAN: Yes, one that you trust implicitly.  
1ST ELDER: I trust all Sensorites. You will be guarded safely.  
SUSAN: Thank you. Please find them, Barbara.  
(Barbara leaves)  
1ST ELDER: A very capable human being.  
SUSAN: Yes, she is.  
1ST ELDER: Gentle, yet with strong determination and courage.  
BOTH: I was going to  
SUSAN: I was going to say, why do you trust your people?  
1ST ELDER: Why do you want to make me doubt them?  
SUSAN: Trust can't be taken for granted. It must be earned. I trust you, but
only because I know you.  
1ST ELDER: But Susan, our whole life is based on trust.  
SUSAN: Yes, and that might be your downfall. Look you don't trust the ground
you walk on until you know it's firm, do you. So why trust your people
blindly?  
1ST ELDER: When I listen to you, you who are so young among your own kind, I
realise that we Sensorites have a lot to learn from the people of Earth.  
SUSAN: Grandfather and I don't come from Earth. Oh, it's ages since we've seen
our planet. It's quite like Earth, but at night the sky is a burned orange,
and the leaves on the trees are bright silver.  
1ST ELDER: My mind tells me that you wish to see your home again, and yet
there is a part of you which calls for adventure. A wanderlust.  
SUSAN: Yes. Well, we'll all go home some day. That's if you'll let us.  
1ST ELDER: I think I will.

**[Tunnels]**

IAN: We could be going round in circles.  
DOCTOR: No, no, my boy. No, no, no, no. I'm marking these, the sections, the
pipes.  
IAN: Uncanny. It's so quiet.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Perhaps they're preparing an ambush.  
IAN: You're a cheerful soul, I must say.  
DOCTOR: I assure you, dear boy, my spirits couldn't be higher. Collecting
evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, calculating it, pursuing it until it's
inevitable. It's fascinating.  
(Ian is staring at a bearded figure)  
IAN: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Oh, don't interrupt, young boy. It's most irritating.  
(Then the Doctor sees a figure too)  
DOCTOR: Chesterton.  
IAN: I know. I've been trying to tell you.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it's all right. Let's back up and perhaps we can jump out
on them.  
(Then they realise they are caught between two people)  
IAN: You were right about the ambush, weren't you.  
DOCTOR: Yes. Don't do anything to alarm them.  
MAN 1: (nearest the Doctor) You have come at last.  
DOCTOR: We came to find you.  
IAN: That's right.  
MAN 2; Watch them, Number One.  
MAN 1: We have been waiting for you. Are they all dead?  
DOCTOR: Dead?  
IAN: The Sensorites, you mean?  
MAN 1: Yes, the Sensorites. Do you have a spaceship?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
MAN 1: Are there more of you?  
IAN: No.  
MAN 2: No others in the channels at all? You haven't brought the Sensorites
with you?  
IAN: No.  
DOCTOR: Wouldn't you like to leave these tunnels and go out into the sunshine
again?  
MAN 1: No, they would hear our minds talking. Follow me. He is going to talk
to you.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought there'd be a third.  
MAN 1: Yes, the Commander. You'll have to talk to him. Follow me.  
(Meanwhile, John and Barbara arrive at the aqueduct, and Barbara contacts
Susan)

**[Reception room]**

SUSAN: They're entering the aqueduct now. It's a little indistinct.  
CAROL: Well, tell her to speak to you. You do the same.  
SUSAN: All right. Barbara, speak the words as you think them. Oh, that's
better.

**[Aqueduct]**

BARBARA: Yes, all right, Susan. We're to go straight ahead to start with, and
then keep turning to the right.  
JOHN: Right. I'll lead.

**[Reception room]**

SUSAN: They're beginning now.

**[Tunnels]**

MAN 1: You'll give us your word you're alone.  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, definitely.

JOHN: There's something here. It's the Doctor's map, all right. I remember the
senior Scientist drawing it in the laboratory.  
BARBARA: But it's all screwed up. They must have realised it was useless.  
JOHN: Shall we take it with us?  
BARBARA: Yes, we'll need it as proof that the maps were tampered with.

**[Reception room]**

1ST ELDER: How is it progressing?  
SUSAN: They haven't found them yet.  
CAROL: Well, at least they found the map.  
SUSAN: Oh, Barbara's talking to me again.

**[Tunnels]**

JOHN: No doubt about it.  
BARBARA: John says this is a fresh mark, probably made by the Doctor. We're
going to try and follow these marks, Susan. So instead of you directing us,
we'll tell you what route we're going to take.  
JOHN: Let's hope they were made by the Doctor, that's all.

(Elsewhere, the Doctor marks another pipe with chalk)  
DOCTOR: In case we have to make a run for it, my boy.  
IAN: I'm glad you're on my side, Doctor.

**[Reception room]**

SUSAN: That's right, Barbara. She's going down this channel now.  
1ST ELDER: And no harm has come to them yet. Perhaps the Doctor and Ian are
chasing the creatures in the aqueduct.  
SUSAN: Or they've been captured.

**[Tunnels]**

MAN 1: Wait here. The new arrivals are here, Commander.  
COMMANDER: This is the best news I've had for a long time. (shakes their
hands) I'm very glad to see you both. Did you have a rough journey? Yes, of
course. I'm sure you must have done. Let's have something to sit down on,
Number One.  
MAN 1: Yes, sir. They're very rough quarters here. You'll have to excuse that.
But I'm sure you're both used to battle stations by now. Yes. Excuse me.
Number Two, you can take over ammunition detail now. You'll find the new
supplies all ready. Hide it in pipe number seven this time. All right, carry
on.  
(Man 2 leaves)  
COMMANDER: Number One?  
MAN 1: Yes, sir.  
COMMANDER: Organise a lecture for Number Two, will you? Civility isn't for me,
you understand, it's for the uniform. Understood?  
MAN 1: Yes, sir.  
COMMANDER: Have to keep discipline up, you know. But they're all good men.
Very fine, Morale's very high here. Sit down.  
IAN: Well, you have a very well ordered base here, sir.  
COMMANDER: It's very good of you to say so.  
DOCTOR: We have a surprise for you. The war with the Sensorites is over.  
COMMANDER: Is that true?  
DOCTOR: Oh, yes.  
COMMANDER: And the planet's ours now, is it? Completely?  
IAN: Completely.  
COMMANDER: Well, this is absolutely wonderful! We nearly lost, you know. I had
command of a fine spaceship, very fine. Two of my men deserted, pretended they
had to go back to Earth to get reinforcements.  
DOCTOR: So you had to blow up your spaceship.  
COMMANDER: Yes. Still, I suppose I'll get another one. I'll be able to afford
it now. Planet's very rich  
IAN: Oh, yes. Molybdenum.  
COMMANDER: Oh, you know about that, do you? You do realise this war has been
fought by me and my men here. Any treasure trove is ours.  
DOCTOR: That's quite understandable, isn't it, Chesterton.  
COMMANDER: And I'm prepared to back that statement up with force, if
necessary. I have good supplies here. Loyal men. Of course, we're just
discussing this. But you are alone, aren't you. Hardly in a position to fight
me. And I have my men, and my organisation.  
MAN 1: Commander. Warning in route two.  
COMMANDER: What? Have you been telling me lies? You've brought other people
with you, haven't you?  
MAN 1: Perhaps they're really allies of the Sensorites.  
COMMANDER: No, Number One, not allies. Spies. The war isn't over at all, is
it. I thought it was a bit too good to be true.  
IAN: Now just a minutes. We knew nothing this warning system of yours  
COMMANDER: No, of course you didn't, and it's tripped you up, hasn't it?
Number One, there'll be a court martial. Immediately. Treason.  
IAN: Barbara!  
BARBARA: Ian.  
IAN: What on Earth are you doing here?  
(babble of greetings between the four)  
COMMANDER: What's this? Who are these people?  
DOCTOR: I'm afraid you misjudged us, sir. These people are part of the
committee, here to welcome you. We all came down here to take you out again to
the surface.  
IAN: To celebrate your success, sir.  
BARBARA: What's going on?  
IAN: Play it cool.  
COMMANDER: And who is this?  
IAN: This is our navigator. She is going to lead us back.  
COMMANDER: Well, I'm glad the fighting's over. Look forward to a bit of a rest
now for a while.  
DOCTOR: Yes, you deserve it, sir. So do your men. And I think the sooner we
take you out into the sunshine, the better.  
COMMANDER: Number One, assemble the men, please. We'll be leaving immediately.
It seems we have a victory to celebrate. You might pass on my congratulations
to the men, Number One.  
MAN 1: Thank you very much, sir.  
COMMANDER: Shall we move, then?

**[Aqueduct]**

(The chief Warrior and a guard are getting their instructions)  
WARRIOR: They are coming. You will take up your position just by the entrance,
there. When they have all come through, you will step out and prevent anyone
from escaping back into the aqueduct. Now take your place.  
(Two ragged men, John, Barbara and Ian emerge)  
WARRIOR: It is useless to resist.  
(The men drop their pointed sticks)  
IAN: Don't worry. I think we can handle these two. Lead on, Barbara.  
(They go off, and the Doctor and the Commander come out)  
COMMANDER: Come back here, you men. Treachery.  
DOCTOR: It's all over now.  
COMMANDER: Treachery!  
(The Warrior uses his paralyser on him)  
DOCTOR: Pitiful fellow. Oh, I know he did your people incalculable harm.  
WARRIOR: I could have killed him. I wanted to. But that would not be the way,
would it.  
DOCTOR: No.  
WARRIOR: He could have destroyed the entire Sensorite nation.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but the fact is, you didn't kill him. Shows great promise for the
future of your people.

**[Reception room]**

IAN: Captain Maitland has agreed to take the others back to Earth.  
BARBARA: They were completely insane. They really believed they were at war
with you.  
1ST ELDER: At some time, they must have opened their minds, or experimented
with the mind transmitters. Every really rational thought was crushed out, and
all they had left was the game they played. The game of war.  
BARBARA: What about the Second Elder?  
1ST ELDER: You finding the map proves his treachery. He will be banished to
the outer wastes.  
IAN: Well, I think we must go back to the ship, sir.  
1ST ELDER: Yes, you must go. The lock has already been sealed back in it's
proper place. So go your way now, and take the gratitude of the Sensorites
with you.  
IAN: Thank you.  
BARBARA: Goodbye.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Where are those other two, hmm?  
SUSAN: They're coming.  
DOCTOR: What's the matter, my child?  
SUSAN: I had a talk with the senior Scientist just before we left. It seems
that the Sensphere has an extraordinary number of ultra high frequencies, so I
won't be able to go on using thought transference.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. It's rather a relief, I think. After all, no one
likes an eavesdropper about, do they. No, I think you obviously have a gift in
that direction. When we get home to our own place, I think we should try and
perfect it.  
SUSAN: When will we get back, Grandfather?  
DOCTOR: I don't know, my dear. This old ship of mine seems to be an aimless
thing. However, we don't worry about it, do we? Do you?  
SUSAN: Sometimes I feel I'd like to belong somewhere, not just be a wanderer.
Still, I'm not unhappy.  
DOCTOR: Good, good.  
(Ian and Barbara enter)  
IAN: Well, here we are.  
DOCTOR: Always last. I very nearly went off without you.  
BARBARA: We were saying goodbye to John and Carol.  
DOCTOR: Let's have a look at Maitland and see him off, shall we?  
(The scanner shows the ship heading into the stars)  
IAN: Well, at least they know where they're going.  
DOCTOR: Implying I don't?  
IAN: I didn't mean anything  
DOCTOR: So, you think I'm an incompetent old fool, do you?  
IAN: Now, Doctor, I never said that.  
DOCTOR: Since you are so dissatisfied, my boy, you can get off the ship. At
the very next place we stop, I shall take you off myself, and that is quite
final. Carry on.
