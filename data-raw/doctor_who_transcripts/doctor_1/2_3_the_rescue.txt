**The Rescue**  

Original Airdate: 2 Jan, 1965  

__**Episode One - The Powerful Enemy**__

(The TARDIS materialises in a darkened cave.)  
(Spaceship 201 is down in the valley. It has a Union Flag on it's tail and is
broken in half. It's radar dish is working)

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

(a young girl rushes in, delighted to hear the beep of a contact on the
screen)  
VICKI: Bennett!

**[Spaceship corridor]**

VICKI: Bennett! The rescue ship's landed! Bennett, let me in!  
BENNETT [OC]: Come in.

**[Bennett's quarters]**

(a man is lying on the bunk)  
VICKI: Bennett, the rescue ship's landed. It's arrived. We're being taken
back. Isn't it marvellous?  
BENNETT: It can't be the ship.  
VICKI: Its quite clear on the detector. Listen.  
(They can hear the radar contact.)  
BENNETT: It must be a fault. Must be. Did you talk to them by radio?  
VICKI: No. I was going to, but I thought I'd tell you first. I thought you'd
be pleased, Bennett.  
BENNETT: The rescue ship's not due for another three days. It can't even find
Dido unless we guide it down. You know that.  
VICKI: But it's showing on the screen. Come and look. I'll help you.  
BENNETT: Did you hear it land?  
VICKI: No. No, I didn't, but it  
BENNETT: The rescue ship can't land silently.  
VICKI: It must have done. It's just got here early that's all. It is here.
It's as plain as anything on the screen.  
BENNETT: What's its location?  
VICKI: I don't know. Somewhere on the mountain.  
BENNETT: Look, Vicki. I know how badly you want to get off this planet. We
both want to get away but its no good building up our hopes. Go and radio the
rescue ship. You'll find your mistake� And Vicki, watch out for Koquillion.  
VICKI: I haven't seen him today.  
BENNETT: He'll be around somewhere. And remember he knows nothing about the
rescue ship.  
VICKI: I know.  
BENNETT: So be careful. If he finds out, he'll kill both of us.

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

VICKI: Planet Dido to rescue ship. Planet Dido to rescue ship. Come in please.
Over.  
CAPTAIN [OC]: Rescue ship to planet Dido. Receiving you on strength two. Over.  
VICKI: Is it true? Have you? Have you landed? Over.  
CAPTAIN [OC]: Landed? We're still sixty nine flying hours away. We're
proceeding on a normal course. We shall  
VICKI: But you, you can't be. I mean�  
CAPTAIN [OC]: Now don't worry. We'll be there. Try to hold on just a bit
longer. We'll contact you for directions in seventeen hours from now. Repeat,
seventeen hours. Breaking contact now.  
VICKI: No!  
CAPTAIN [OC]: Over and out.  
VICKI: No! Dido to rescue! Dido to rescue!  
(no reply)  
VICKI: Sixty nine hours away? Who's landed on the mountain?

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor is asleep in his chair)  
BARBARA: And you know how the ship has a faint sort of trembling while we're
moving? Well, I suddenly realised that it had stopped.  
IAN: I believe you're right, Barbara. I think we have landed. But the Doctor's
never slept through a landing before.  
BARBARA: Doctor. Doctor!  
IAN: Doctor!  
BARBARA: Wake up.  
DOCTOR: Hmm? What's the matter? What is it? What is it? Oh good gracious me!
Don't tell me I went off to sleep.  
IAN: Yes, you did.  
DOCTOR: Oh!  
IAN: At a very critical time. Oh well, I suppose it did you a world of good.  
DOCTOR: Deep in the arms of Morpheus, hey my boy? Well, I feel a bit sticky. I
must go and have a wash.  
BARBARA: Oh, but Doctor, the trembling's stopped.  
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear, I'm so glad you're feeling better.  
BARBARA: No, not me, the ship.  
DOCTOR: Oh, the. Oh my dear, I'm so sorry.  
IAN: Doctor, we appear to have landed while you were asleep.  
DOCTOR: What? Oh, I say, I must never allow this sort of thing again now, must
we? No. Well, all we have to do is to turn the power off.  
BARBARA: Then we have landed.  
DOCTOR: Yes, er, excuse me, materialised, I think, is a better word. Well now,
lets have a look and see what's doing. Yes, the air's very good. The
temperature. Yes, wherever we are, I think its nice and fine. (Yawns) Oh, do
pardon me. Forgive me, I'm so sorry. Yes. Well, I must say, this looks most
promising. Now, lets have a little look shall we?  
(The scanner shows the cave.)  
IAN: Very dark. Can't really make out anything at all. It looks very rocky,
whatever it is.  
DOCTOR: Yes. It does somewhat. Might be a cave, or�even perhaps underground.  
BARBARA: You mean we could be trapped down here?  
DOCTOR: Oh. It doesn't necessarily mean anything my dear Barbara. We can, of
course, always travel through�solid matter in flight� and all, again, we can,
we can take off again quite easily. No, I do think we ought to step outside
and have a look. I will too. Susan, er  
BARBARA: Doctor, why don't you show me how to open the doors?  
DOCTOR: Hmm? Yes, yes, yes, my dear. Of course, yes, yes, how silly of me.
Yes, number four switch.  
(and the doors open)  
DOCTOR: Very good, very good. You won't, of course, try to do that during
transit, will you?

**[Cave]**

IAN: It is a cave. You were right Doctor.  
BARBARA: Strange funny smell. Doesn't smell like anything on Earth.  
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't my dear. No, no. But I do know that smell.  
IAN: You recognise it?  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, more or less. Oh, have a look round, I should, but don't go
too far away. Remember we haven't had much luck with these caves during our
travels.  
BARBARA: What are you going to do?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I think I'm going to have a nap.  
(The Doctor returns to the Tardis)  
IAN: A nap? Huh. Well that's a new one, isn't it? He's usually the first one
to be up and dashing off for a look.  
BARBARA: Maybe we're going to see a new side to the Doctor.  
IAN: Yes, well, he isn't getting any younger is he. You know, it's the first
time he's been to sleep during a landing. Barbara, I've got an idea he's
getting a bit (hand gesture for senile)  
DOCTOR: Remember I can hear what you're saying. Pick up that stone for me,
would you?  
IAN: This one, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
IAN: Certainly.  
DOCTOR: Thank you.  
(The Doctor goes back inside)  
BARBARA: Look, Ian, all the old associations are still in the ship. You can't
expect him to say goodbye to Susan and then forget about her the next minute.  
IAN: No, I suppose not. I wonder what she's doing now?  
BARBARA: If I know any�anything about David, she's learning to milk cows.  
IAN: Yes, he's a nice chap, David.  
BARBARA: Come on.  
IAN: There may be a way over here, you know.  
BARBARA: Yes, but I think the sun is coming through that way.  
IAN: Ah, so it is. (Ian and Barbara leave the cave, and something with spikes
around its neck, bug eyes and antennae is seen inspecting the Tardis)

**[Ledge]**

(Ian and Barbara come out onto a ledge in front of a sheer cliff)  
IAN: Barbara, look!  
BARBARA: It's a spaceship.  
IAN: Yes� broken in two.  
IAN: Can you see on the side? A flag! It's from home!  
BARBARA: Yes! You know it must have crashed.  
IAN: Yes, although you see those buildings? It might have been destroyed at
the same time as they were on the ground.  
BARBARA: There's no movement. No sign of life at all.  
IAN: No. No, there isn't, is there? Well, there must be people or things on
this planet.  
BARBARA: Ian.  
IAN: Hmm?  
BARBARA: Are you going to tell the Doctor about this?  
IAN: Yes. Why not?  
BARBARA: Well, knowing the Doctor, he'll want to go down there and
investigate.  
IAN: Well, for once I'd agree with him, Barbara. If there are any of those
crew members left we should get in touch with them.  
BARBARA: Ian!  
(The thing that had been looking at the Tardis is behind them)  
KOQUILLION: You are strangers here. Answer my question. Do you come from
Earth?  
BARBARA: Yes. Yes, we do.  
KOQUILLION: Where is your rocket ship?  
IAN: You've just come out of the cave. You must have seen it.  
KOQUILLION: You landed here�in that box?  
BARBARA: Well I know it sounds fantastic, but we have no reason to lie to you.  
IAN: Well, obviously you've had a good look around. Did you see any sign of
another ship having landed?  
KOQUILLION: Are there any other crewmembers?  
IAN: Yes, there is. There's one more and he's back in the ship.  
KOQUILLION: I would like to meet him. Go and fetch him. I will take you all to
the city.  
IAN: Coming, Barbara?  
BARBARA: Yes.  
(But the creature actually blocks her way, holding something like a wrench)  
KOQUILLION: Why are you frightened?  
BARBARA: Keep away.  
KOQUILLION: I am your friend. You can trust me.  
BARBARA: Can I? (The creature pushes Barbara over the ledge)

**[Tardis]**

(The Doctor is examining the rock and making notes)  
DOCTOR: Oh, my writing gets worse and worse. Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.
Well, undoubtedly we've landed on the planet Dido. How remarkable. Well, I
must say. it'll be rather nice to meet these friendly people again after all
these years. Fancy landing back here again. I wonder if I were to tell Ian
that it was deliberate, whether he'd believe me or not? Oh no, of course, I
was asleep. Oh, pity, pity, pity.

**[Ledge]**

(Koquillion uses his wrench, and there is an explosion in the passage to the
cave)

**[Cave]**

DOCTOR: Chesterton! Chesterton! Where are you, my dear boy? Oh, I can't, oh, I
can't see anything.  
(The Doctor goes back inside the Tardis.)  
(Meanwhile, Barbara is unconscious at the bottom of the cliff, holding a
broken branch. The shadow of another person falls over her)  
(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis with a torch)  
DOCTOR: Chesterton! Oh, my dear fellow, are you all right?  
IAN: Barbara.  
DOCTOR: Where is she?  
IAN: Barbara. I thought she was with me. I, I heard her scream�  
DOCTOR: Steady, steady, steady.  
IAN: I went back and an explosion.  
DOCTOR: Come on, come on, get your breath back. Now, now then, you all right?  
IAN: Yes�  
DOCTOR: well, let's try and look for her, shall we?  
IAN: Yes, it's�this way.  
DOCTOR: Be careful now, be careful. Oh, good gracious, the whole roof's fallen
in!  
IAN: This blocks the cave! Barbara!  
(Ian tries to move the rocks)  
DOCTOR: Oh, I hope we shan't get another fall. I don't think the Tardis is
likely to  
IAN: No use. Doctor, this wasn't an accident.  
DOCTOR: What are you talking about, my boy?  
IAN: Oh it was a�thing, a repulsive thing with a�hideous face.  
DOCTOR: With hands and feet like claws?  
IAN: Yes, that's it. How do you know?  
DOCTOR: Well, this is the planet Dido. I've been here before, I know them very
well.  
IAN: What?  
DOCTOR: They're very friendly people.  
IAN: Friendly?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
IAN: Oh, it certainly wasn't friendly to us. Must have kept Barbara back. That
scream. Barbara!  
DOCTOR: Oh don't for heavens sake start scratching there. Try and find another
way out. This thing, was it armed?  
IAN: No, no, it wasn't. Wait a minute, it was carrying some sort of jewelled
club. About so long.  
DOCTOR: With a big head, resembling a spanner?  
IAN: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
IAN: I don't know why you bother to ask.  
DOCTOR: Yes, that may account for this.  
IAN: What?  
DOCTOR: When I was here last time, if I remember rightly, they'd just
perfected this thing. It's a ray, used in construction work.  
IAN: Ahh.  
DOCTOR: Now look here, what about Barbara, are you all right? Are you capable?  
IAN: Yes, I'm not too bad.  
DOCTOR: Come along. Don't just sit there, my dear boy, stand up, stand up.
Come along, that's it, mind your head. It's only dust. No bones broken.  
IAN: Thank you. Doctor. The most thorough-going medical I've ever had.  
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a pity I didn't get that degree, isn't it? Excuse me.  
IAN: You say these people were friendly?  
DOCTOR: Really. Very friendly people.  
IAN: If that's a sample, I'll take the Daleks anytime.  
DOCTOR: Now look here, you take yourself off there and try and find Barbara.  
IAN: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Come along and be careful.  
IAN: Yeah, we need to be careful. These people are dangerous.  
DOCTOR: But why? What could have happened to changed them? I wonder.

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

(Vicki is making a bed when she hears a noise. She grabs some stones and
pretends to be examining them when -)  
KOQUILLION: You have been outside. Stand up! What were you doing?  
VICKI: Walking.  
KOQUILLION: In future, you will go no further than fifty yards from this ship.
Do you understand? You were dragging something. A sack.  
VICKI: Oh, just some stones, I collect them. They're very beautiful.  
KOQUILLION: I'm going to talk to Bennett. Remember you both owe your lives to
me.  
VICKI: I heard a sound from the mountain. An explosion.  
KOQUILLION: A space machine has arrived.  
VICKI: People?  
KOQUILLION: A warlike people. They wanted to pillage the ship! I could not
save them from my people, as I do Bennett and yourself. They're walled up in a
cave. If they're not dead already, they will die of hunger and thirst.  
VICKI: I bet you never gave them a chance, you could have (he raises the club)
I'm sorry.  
KOQUILLION: Remember, I am the only one who can save you from my people. You
should be grateful. I am your only protection!

**[Spaceship corridor]**

BENNETT [OC]: You can't come in.  
KOQUILLION: It is Koquillion! Open the door.

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

(Vicki listens at the door to the corridor, then goes back to the bed she made
and removes blankets to reveal Barbara)  
VICKI: Koquillion has just seen me helping you here. I knew he would. I knew.
He knows everything. Everything!  
BARBARA: Well, tell me  
VICKI: Shh! He'll hear you.  
BARBARA: Oh, all right.  
VICKI: Please, stay there. He might come back. You don't know him like I do.  
BARBARA: Yes, but listen, what's your name?  
VICKI: Vicki.  
BARBARA: Is that short for Victoria?  
VICKI: No, just Vicki. V,I,C,K,I.  
BARBARA: I'm Barbara. Look, tell me more about this Koquillion.  
VICKI: He just keeps us here, Bennett and me. There's a rescue ship on the
way. He doesn't know about that. But he'll find out. I know he will.  
BARBARA: But why does he keep you here?  
VICKI: They, they killed all the crew. We, when we landed, we made contact
here. Everyone on board was invited to a grand sort of meeting. I couldn't go,
I was ill, a fever or something. I stayed here that night. I remember waking
up. A thunderstorm, I thought, but it was an explosion. Bennett. Bennett
dragged himself back. I was ill for days, I didn't know about it til later. I
came around and�found Bennett. He can't walk. We just wait, and then
Koquillion.  
(she falls sobbing into Barbara's arms)  
BARBARA: Well, if his people killed all your crew, why did, doesn't he kill
you.  
VICKI: We don't know. My father was taking me. My father. (she dries her eyes)
Your ship. Is your ship still here?  
BARBARA: Yes.  
VICKI: I've just remembered. He told me. Didn't you hear him? They, they've
killed all your crew too.

**[Cave passage]**

IAN: Oh, I wonder how much further, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I can't understand it. I just can't understand it. Violence is
totally alien to people on this planet.  
IAN: Oh, well, people change, Doctor. New leader, different set of
circumstances.  
DOCTOR: No, no, no, my dear Chesterton, no. All the more reason for people on
this planet to hate death and destruction. My dear boy, when I was here
before, the, what, the total population amounted to, a handle of people.
Merely a hundred.  
IAN: Is that all?  
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. All the more reason for holding onto life. Peace,
friendship, happiness. This means everything to the people here.  
IAN: Yes. Yes, I see what you mean. Well, you ready to carry on?  
DOCTOR: Me? Carry on? My dear fellow, it was you that stopped.

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

VICKI: Sorry, Barbara, I forgot all about your cuts and bruises.  
BARBARA: Oh it could be worse. It's the arm mainly. I must have strained it
catching hold of that tree to break my fall.  
VICKI: There. How's that?  
BARBARA: That feels much better.  
VICKI: I wonder if Koquillion's gone?  
BARBARA: What are the other people like?  
VICKI: Mmm? Oh, he's the only one we see. They live quite near here, I believe
but, well, I don't know. This fires a flare.  
BARBARA: Is that for the rescue ship?  
VICKI: Yes, I always keep it ready. There's room to land round here, you know.  
BARBARA: It'll all be ending for you soon then.  
VICKI: Yes.  
BARBARA: Well, you don't sound very sure.  
VICKI: There's always Koquillion. He could stop us. He could keep me here
forever. What are you looking like that for?  
BARBARA: Like what?  
VICKI: You're sorry for me, aren't you? I'm perfectly all right, you know. I
don't care if nobody ever comes, I'm fine. I'm perfectly all right.  
(They hear a noise)  
VICKI: Quick!  
(She hides Barbara under the blankets again)  
VICKI: Oh, Bennett.  
BENNETT: He's gone. He tried to get things out of me but I didn't tell him.  
VICKI: No.  
BENNETT: I didn't tell him about the rescue ship.  
VICKI: No.  
BENNETT: He told me about the people on the mountain. He's killed them. We've
got to stick together, Vicki. He's killed them.  
VICKI: No, he hasn't, Bennett. Not all of them anyway.  
(And she reveals Barbara)

**[Cave passageway]**

IAN: The ledge is narrowing out now, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: What's that, my boy, What? What's that?  
(The Doctor slips, and Ian grabs him.)  
IAN: Oh, oh, careful!  
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! I say, look, have you noticed the
ledge? It's narrowing out.  
IAN: Yes, Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Wait, wait.  
IAN: Huh?  
DOCTOR: Point the torch, shine it down there. You see that? It's quite a
chasm.  
IAN: Yes. It certainly is. Not very much to hold onto here either. We'll just
have to keep ourselves�pressed against the rock face.  
DOCTOR: My dear boy, if I pressed myself any harder against this thing I would
be doing myself an injury.  
(There's a roar)  
IAN: What was that?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's not me, is it. Shine the torch down there!  
(The torch reveals another one of Koquillion's race, but with no legs)  
DOCTOR: What�  
IAN: What's that nightmare?  
DOCTOR: Isn't it sufficient that it�it's down there and we're up here? Hmm?  
IAN: Yes. It's got eyes. I saw them. Green. Used to daylight. Must have come
in from the outside.  
DOCTOR: Oh. Very good, yes. Very intelligent reasoning. So good I might have
said the same thing myself.  
IAN: Got to get out of here. What we need are some good handholds. Oh, here we
are, all provided.  
(There are carvings with rings in them)  
IAN: You're right, Doctor. Somebody's been this way before.  
DOCTOR: Well, now, be careful.  
IAN: Yes I will, just hold onto that. (the torch.) Try this. It's all right.  
IAN: Yes. Give me the torch. Swing yourself over. All right? Okay?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
(Ian reaches for the third handle.)  
IAN: Watch this one. It's loose. Oh! hurry up, I've pulled it out!  
DOCTOR: What?  
IAN: Oh, I'm over. Can you manage?  
DOCTOR: Chesterton, it's oil. It's got oil on it.  
IAN: What's that noise?  
DOCTOR: Come back here. They've trapped you into pulling this thing out.  
IAN: What's that noise, Doctor? I  
(Ian is trapped between two lots of horizontal metal spikes coming straight
out of the wall in front and behind him)  
DOCTOR: Don't go any further!  
IAN: What? I can't go either way!  
(More spikes come out of the wall, from ground to hip level)  
IAN: Doctor, They're pushing me towards the edge!

__**Episode Two - Desperate Measures**__

**[Cave passageway]**

(Ian puts a hand on the spikes)  
IAN: Doctor, they're razor sharp!  
DOCTOR: Take your coat off, my boy, and throw it over the blades.  
IAN: Hold the torch for me please.  
DOCTOR: Right. Now swing yourself round.  
IAN: Give me a hand.  
DOCTOR: Come on, come on, come on.  
(Ian manages to swing round the spikes)  
IAN: Thanks. I thought I'd had it. What do you think this is for?  
DOCTOR: I've no idea. I've never seen it before in my life.  
IAN: I suppose this operates the knives.  
DOCTOR: Yes, quite so. We've got to get this thing back in its place.  
IAN: The executioner sounds disappointed.  
DOCTOR: Yes, never mind about all that. Come on, give me a hand. Barbara's
still outside. She might be in grave danger.

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

(Bennett is on the bunk with Barbara checking for a heartbeat)  
VICKI: Is he, is he dead?  
BARBARA: No, it must have been the strain of walking out here made him
collapse. How do you feel?  
VICKI: This is Barbara, Bennett.  
BENNETT: Koquillion told me of your arrival. He's killed your friends.  
BARBARA: I don't think so. I'm sure they're all right.  
BENNETT: Koquillion doesn't make mistakes.  
BARBARA: Well he did about me. You know, the next time he visits us, we might
be able to surprise him. He doesn't know I'm here, does he, so we could set a
trap and overpower him.  
BENNETT: No, no.  
VICKI: It's a marvellous idea, isn't it, Bennett.  
BENNETT: No!  
BARBARA: Well, surely it's worth a try? You wouldn't be any worse off than you
are now.  
BENNETT: The Mir rescue ship is due to arrive, or hasn't Vicki told you that.
We have to sit still, do as he says. Maybe we'll have a chance of escaping,
get back to Earth.  
VICKI: We could still go.  
BENNETT: You're just a child, you don't know what you're talking about. We get
rid of Koquillion, we gain nothing. If the plan fails, he kills us.  
VICKI: Bennett's right, Barbara.  
BENNETT: Course I'm right. Just because I lie on that bed all day doesn't mean
I've lost the use of my brain. Help me to my room, please.

**[Spaceship corridor]**

BENNETT: You will do as Koquillion says, won't you? Now you do understand the
consequences? Thank you.  
BARBARA: I'll help you to your bed.  
BENNETT: I'm all right. I said, I'm all right! I can manage.  
(Bennett slams the door in Barbara's face)  
VICKI: I'd better go and collect the water, it gets dark early on Dido. Will
you lay the table, Barbara?  
BARBARA: Yes. Yes, all right.  
VICKI: I'll show you where the things are.

**[Cave passageway]**

DOCTOR: There you are. I think that's got it back. Watch!  
(The blades retract)  
IAN: Yes. You've done it, Doctor. There they go. Well, lets hope there aren't
any more surprises like that waiting for us. Come on.  
(The doctor stops to examine the rock carving where the blades had come out.)  
IAN: Well, come on, Doctor. (Meanwhile, Vicki is carrying jerry-cans of water
whilst being watched by a Didonian, again with no legs)  
IAN: Daylight, Doctor! We must be nearly there.  
DOCTOR: Yes, I think you're right. Chesterton!  
IAN: Look out, Doctor. Don't go too near the edge.  
DOCTOR: Oh, right. Look, there's a door.  
IAN: What?  
DOCTOR: Now that must lead somewhere.  
IAN: Yes, it is.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but there'll be no time to open that. No, come on, let's go the
obvious way.  
IAN: All right.  
DOCTOR: Go on, go on.  
IAN: Now mind this edge.  
DOCTOR: Just so long as nobody starts creeping up behind us.

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

(Through the porthole, Barbara spots a Didonian about to pounce on Vicki. She
grabs the flare gun from the cupboard and runs outside)

**[Outside the spaceship]**

BARBARA: Vicki!  
VICKI: No! No don't! No!  
(Barbara shoots the Didonian)

**[Cave passageway]**

(Ian and the Doctor hear the shot and death cry echoing)  
DOCTOR: What was that?  
IAN: Horrible.  
DOCTOR: What is it?  
IAN: Come on.

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

VICKI: You killed Sandy. Why? What made you?  
BARBARA: He was almost on top of you!  
VICKI: How could you do it? Sandy only wanted some food.  
BARBARA: But he was going to attack you!  
VICKI: Sandy only ever eat plants. I trained him to come here for food.  
BARBARA: Well, I didn't know that did I? I mean, how could I?  
VICKI: I shouted, you wouldn't listen.  
BARBARA: Look, all I could see was its jaws. Anyway it suddenly started
screeching I thought that  
VICKI: You killed him! You killed him!  
(The Doctor and Ian enter)  
DOCTOR: Barbara!  
BARBARA: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: My dear Barbara!  
IAN: Barbara!  
BARBARA: Oh Doctor, you're all right!  
DOCTOR: Oh, I've never felt better in my life!  
(Koquillion comes out of the door in the cave passageway, follows their
footprints to the ledge, and looks down on the spaceship)

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

DOCTOR: That's better, that's better. Now blow your nose and wipe your face.
That's it. I don't like saying it, my dear, but you do look a bit of a mess,
you know.  
IAN: Yes, cheer up, Vicki. And don't forget, if old Kokylikin comes round,
I've always got this.  
VICKI: You mustn't, Ian. I keep telling you why we did what he said. You'll
spoil it, you'll spoil everything.  
DOCTOR: Now, now, now. It's going to be all right. We're not going to
jeopardise your safety or your rescue. Now, first of all, I'd like to have a
talk with this Mister Bennett of yours.  
VICKI: Oh, I keep  
DOCTOR: Will you take me to him?  
VICKI: I keep telling you, the rescue ship's on its way. It's going to take us
back to Earth. Can't you understand?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
BARBARA: Look Vicki, I know you've been here a long time, but you're
underestimating what Koquillion can do.  
VICKI: Yes, you're right. I've been here a long time. I know what it's like
here. You've only just come and you're trying to ruin things. It was all right
before. It was. The rescue ship's coming and nobody asked you to come here.
Nobody.  
DOCTOR: Now, Vicki.  
VICKI: Go away.  
(Ian and Barbara leave)  
DOCTOR: Vicki, my dear. Sit down. You don't mean that, do you? Well, do you?
Mmm? Good, good. Now, I've listened to all you've said and I've thoroughly
understood. We're here to help you. This is all we're going to try to do. You
know, we're not going to ruin things for you.  
VICKI: Bennett says that when we get back we've got to tell them on Earth what
they did to us here. He thinks this planet should be wiped out.  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
VICKI: He says Koquillion shouldn't be made to get away with what he's done to
us.  
DOCTOR: I think I agree with Bennett, at least about Koquillion. But don't you
think there's just a chance, just a little chance that my ideas might prove
the better ones? Hmm? Good, good. Now, I'll go and have a talk with Mister
Bennett and I promise you, I'll listen to everything he says. Hmm?  
VICKI: I'll take you to him.  
DOCTOR: Splendid.

**[Spaceship corridor]**

DOCTOR: Yes, well now, I don't think you need to wait, my dear. You go back
with Ian and Barbara. Hmm?  
VICKI: Barbara.  
DOCTOR: Oh, now, now, now, You mustn't be like that. You're not giving her
much of a chance, are you? She's nice, you know. You'll like her.  
VICKI: She killed Sandy.  
DOCTOR: Yes, well, so might I have done!  
VICKI: No.  
DOCTOR: Hmm?  
VICKI: Well, you haven't got the sort of face that kills things  
DOCTOR: And Barbara has, I suppose. Ay? You know she was frightened,
frightened for your safety. She thought you were going to be hurt. Good
gracious me, you mustn't behave like that. Now, look here, I think the best
thing for you to do is to pop along back there, don't you, hmm? Eh? You must
believe what Barbara did, try and understand my dear, and why she did it. Just
for me, eh?  
(The Doctor knocks on Bennett's door)  
DOCTOR: Mister Bennett?  
BENNETT [OC]: You can't come in.  
(The Doctor forces the door open, but it sticks)  
DOCTOR: I want to talk to you. Oh dear.  
(He finds a piece of girder and uses it as a battering ram)

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

(Ian and Barbara enter)  
IAN: The Doctor gone to see Miser Bennett?  
VICKI: Yes, I took him.  
IAN: Good, good.  
VICKI: Barbara?  
BARBARA: Yes?  
VICKI: I'm sorry. Really I am.  
BARBARA: I'm sorry too, about Sandy.  
VICKI: Well, you didn't know. I'm afraid I've got rather used to being on my
own.  
IAN: We know how you feel Vicki. We felt the same way ourselves at first.  
VICKI: At first? I don't understand. You're from Earth too, aren't you?  
BARBARA: Yes, but it goes a bit deeper than that.  
VICKI: How do you mean?  
BARBARA: Well, what was the year when you left Earth?  
VICKI: 2493, of course. My mother had just died and Daddy wanted to get away
so he took a job on the planet Astra.  
IAN: You were on your way there and you crashed here?  
VICKI: Yes. But why did you ask me the year? What year did you leave?  
IAN: Well, you see Vicki, our space ship, well, isn't like this one. It
travels through time.  
BARBARA: We left in 1963.  
VICKI: 1963! But that means you're about five hundred and fifty years old.  
BARBARA: Why, yes, I suppose I am. Yes, it's a way of looking at it, but I'll
try not to look at it too often.  
VICKI: They didn't have time machines in 1963, they didn't know anything then.  
IAN: Oh, we weren't entirely ignorant, young lady. Even the Doctor thought it
was worth paying us a visit. That's how we got mixed up with him in the first
place.  
BARBARA: The Doctors from a different age, a different planet altogether.  
VICKI: I don't believe you at all, you're joking with me. The Doctor, a time
traveller?  
IAN + BARBARA: Yes!

**[Bennett's quarters]**

(The Doctor finds the room is empty, so he does a search)  
DOCTOR: What have we here? Tape recordings for what?  
(He presses play)  
BENNETT [OC]: You can't come in.  
(Then he turns up the volume on a receiver)  
VICKI [OC]: Oh yes, I like the Doctor.

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

VICKI: Its funny, but as soon as he walked in, I felt that you could trust
him. But why does he wear those funny clothes? And that long white hair.  
BARBARA: Vicki, I've told you, the Doctor comes from another time.

**[Bennett's quarters]**

VICKI [OC]: Oh, don't start that again.  
DOCTOR: Silly child, silly child.  
DOCTOR: Intercom systems, tape recordings. Now, I wonder what else, hmm?  
(He finds a lever that opens a trap door in the floor)  
DOCTOR: Yes, I see, an easy way to get out of a locked room.

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

IAN: They're taking a long time aren't they?  
VICKI: I don't think we should disturb them.  
IAN: Well, they can always tell me to go away.

**[Spaceship corridor]**

IAN: Doctor? Mister Bennett? Can I come in? Doctor? Doctor!

**[Bennett's quarters]**

IAN: They've gone!  
(Barbara and Vicki run in. The trapdoor is closed)

**[Cave passageway]**

(The Doctor goes through a door in the wall into)

**[Chamber]**

(Incense burning on pillars, decorated table, and altar and a chest full of
vestments)

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

BARBARA: But where could they have gone to?  
VICKI: Perhaps Koquillion came.  
IAN: No, we would have heard him. Anyway, the Doctor would surely have warned
us.  
BARBARA: He wouldn't go off without telling us. What do you think we ought to
do?  
VICKI: I think we should stay here.  
IAN: No. Go back to the Tardis. In the end, the Doctor'll make for that. Come
on, quickly.

**[Chamber]**

DOCTOR: Come in. Come in, won't you? I've been waiting to talk to you.  
(Koquillion enters behind the Doctor)  
DOCTOR: This used to be the Peoples' Hall of Judgement. Fitting, in the
present circumstances don't you think, hmm? Mister Bennett, may I remind you
that masks and robes such as you are wearing are only used on absolutely
ceremonial occasions, hmm?  
(Bennett removes the mask)  
BENNETT: Are you finished?  
DOCTOR: Yes, I had hoped that you would continue. This elaborate plan must
have been conceived for some reason. What, hmm?  
BENNETT: To save my life. I killed a crewmember on the spaceship to Astra. I
was arrested. The ship crashed. My crime hadn't been radioed to Earth. I knew
if I could get rid of the other crewmembers.  
DOCTOR: Get rid of the other crewmembers and blame their deaths on the Dido
people, hmm?  
BENNETT: When we crash landed, the inhabitants invited us all to a grand
meeting. It was simple. I just arranged an explosive, using the ships
armaments. The whole thing went up. All the inhabitants, the crew, the whole
race.  
DOCTOR: You destroyed a whole planet to save your own skin. You're insane.  
BENNETT: The girl didn't know I'd been arrested. When we get back to Earth,
she'd support my story. I dressed up as Koquillion to show her how terrible
the people here were.  
DOCTOR: If that happened, your guilt would have been hidden forever, hmm?  
BENNETT: If it happened? Nothing's changed. There's only three more people for
Koquillion to kill, that's all.  
(They struggle for the club, and there is an explosion. The club is broken in
the fall. The Doctor and Bennett fight, with Bennett easily overpowering him
and starting to choke him when two people dressed in white appear)  
BENNETT: No! I thought I'd killed all of you!  
(Bennett flees, and there's a scream. Presumably he fell off that narrow ledge
outside. The Doctor passes out)

**[Tardis]**

BARBARA: He's coming round.  
DOCTOR: Oh, Barbara, Ian. We're back in the ship, eh?  
IAN: Yes, I took the liberty of borrowing your key.  
BARBARA: Doctor, we found you outside.  
DOCTOR: Yes, that's, they left me outside.  
IAN: They? Who?  
DOCTOR: Oh, er, two strangers. Yes, Bennett's dead. Bennett was Koquillion,
you know.  
IAN: What? Bennett Koquillion?  
DOCTOR: Yes.  
IAN: What, well, why, why, Doctor?  
BARBARA: No, no, no, no, not now Ian, He's in no condition to answer
questions.  
DOCTOR: The girl, Vicki, now. Did you, did you bring her?  
BARBARA: Yes.  
DOCTOR: Where?  
BARBARA: She's waiting outside.  
DOCTOR: Oh, I must get some fresh air. Yes, I want to have a talk with that
child.  
IAN: Are you all right?  
DOCTOR: Yes, now don't fuss especially, I'm quite all right, my boy. I'm quite
all right.  
(The Doctor leaves)  
BARBARA: Ian, what about Vicki? I wish we could take her with us. Hmm? Well,
we can't leave her here, can we?

**[Cave]**

DOCTOR: That's about what happened, and that's all.  
VICKI: Then Bennett murdered my father. Then I've got nobody.  
DOCTOR: My dear. My dear, why don't you come with us, hmm?  
VICKI: In that old box?  
DOCTOR: We can travel anywhere and everywhere in that old box as you call it.
Regardless of space and time.  
VICKI: Then it is a time machine?  
DOCTOR: And if you like adventure, my dear, I can promise you an abundance of
it. Apart from all that, well you'll be amongst friends. Hmm? Well? Now,
suppose I leave you here for a moment to think about it, hmm?

**[Tardis]**

BARBARA: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Yes?  
BARBARA: We were talking about Vicki and we were wondering whether  
IAN: Yes, do you think er, Vicki  
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, I can see that we've all reached the same decision.
Now, I suggest we try and get the answer from the child, hmm? Vicki? Vicki, my
dear, come in.  
VICKI: But its huge! And, well, the outside is just, well  
BARBARA: Vicki, are you going to come with us?  
VICKI: Oh I, I'd like to. Yes, if you'll have me.

**[Spaceship living quarters]**

CAPTAIN [OC]: Rescue ship to Dido. Rescue ship to Dido. Come in please. This
is rescue ship calling Dido. Rescue ship calling Dido.  
(The men in white enter)  
CAPTAIN [OC]: Come in please. Dido, can you hear me? This is rescue ship
calling  
(The men smash the radio.)

**[Tardis]**

(in flight)  
IAN: So there were survivors on Dido? Bennett didn't kill them all?  
DOCTOR: They have their planet back to themselves again. And somehow I don't
think they will allow that rescue ship to land. Well.  
IAN: Hmm. That isn't why you brought Vicki along with us, is it Doctor?  
DOCTOR: No, Chesterton, no, it wasn't the reason. We shall be materialising
quite soon. Perhaps we shall be able to get a rest this time.
