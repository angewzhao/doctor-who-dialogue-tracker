**Father's Day**  
  
Original Airdate: 14 May, 2005  

**[Memory \- Jackie's bedroom]**

(A photograph of a laughing man with thinning hair.)  
ROSE [OC]: Peter Alan Tyler my dad. The most wonderful man in the world. Born
15th September 1954.  
JACKIE: Come here, Rose. Come here  
(Jackie has got a photograph album open. Little Rose joins her on the bed.)  
JACKIE: Who's that? It's your daddy. You weren't old enough to remember when
he died. 1987, 7th of November. Do you remember what I told you? The day that
Stuart Hoskins and Sarah Clarke got married. He was always having adventures.
Oh, he would have loved to have seen you now.

**[Tardis]**

ROSE: That's what Mum always says. So I was thinking, could we, could we go
and see my dad when he was still alive?  
DOCTOR: Where's this come from, all of a sudden?  
ROSE: All right then, if we can't, if it goes against the laws of times or
something, then never mind, just leave it.  
DOCTOR: No, I can do anything. I'm just more worried about you.  
ROSE: I want to see him.  
DOCTOR: Your wish is my command. But be careful what you wish for.

**[Register office]**

(The Doctor and Rose attend her parent's wedding.)  
REGISTRAR: I, Peter Alan Tyler, take you, Jacqueline Angela Suzette Prentice  
PETE: I, Peter Alan Tyler, take you, Jacqueline Suzanne Suzette Anita  
JACKIE: Oh, just carry on. It's good enough for Lady Di.  
ROSE: I thought he'd be taller.  
REGISTRAR: To be my lawful wedded wife, to love and behold till death us do
part.  
JACKIE [OC]: He died so close to home.

**[Memory - Jackie's bedroom]**

JACKIE: I wasn't there. Nobody was. It was a hit and run driver. Never found
out who. He was dead when the ambulance got there. I only wish there'd been
someone there for him.  
ROSE [OC]: I want to be that someone, so he doesn't die alone.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: November the 7th?  
ROSE: 1987.  
(The time rotor starts up.)

**[Waterley Street]**

(The Tardis has parked herself between a telephone junction box and a road
sign, by park railings. Never Can Say Goodbye is playing somewhere.)  
ROSE: It's so weird. The day my father died. I thought it'd be all sort of
grim and stormy. It's just an ordinary day.  
DOCTOR: The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. Are you
sure about this?  
ROSE: Yeah.

**[Jordan Road]**

ROSE: This is it. Jordan Road. He was late. He'd been to get a wedding
present, a vase. Mum always said, that stupid vase.  
(A green van comes around the corner. D602 PKW)  
ROSE: He got out of his car.  
(It pulls into the kerb.)  
ROSE: And crossed the road.  
ROSE: Oh, God. This is it.  
(As Pete gets out of the van, the Doctor takes Rose's hand. A beige car comes
round the corner - NEH 793W - and straight into Pete. The driver shields his
face with his arm and keeps going, leaving Pete and the broken vase in the
middle of the road. Pete tries to move.)  
DOCTOR: Go to him, quick.  
(But she can't. Later, round the corner, as sirens approach.)  
ROSE: It's too late now. By the time the ambulance got there, he was dead. He
can't die on his own. Can I try again?  
(The Doctor and Rose look round the corner to see themselves by the kerbside.)  
DOCTOR: Right, that's the first you and me. It's a very bad idea, two sets of
us being here at the same time. Just be careful they don't see us. Wait till
she runs off and he follows, then go to your dad.  
(Pete parks at the kerb.)  
ROSE 1: Oh, God. This is it.  
ROSE: I can't do this.  
DOCTOR: You don't have to do anything you don't want to, but this is the last
time we can be here.  
(Rose runs forward as Pete is getting out of the van.)  
DOCTOR: Rose! No!  
(Rose dashes past her earlier self and pushes her father out of the path of
the beige car. The vase rolls away, unbroken. The earlier Doctor and Rose
vanish.)  
ROSE: I did it. I saved your life.  
PETE: Blimey, did you see the speed of it? Did you get his number?  
ROSE: I really did it. Oh, my God, look at you. You're alive! That car was
going to kill you.  
PETE: Give me some credit, I did see it coming. I wasn't going to walk under
it, was I.  
ROSE: I'm Rose.  
PETE: That's a coincidence. That's my daughter's name.  
ROSE: That's a great name. Good choice. Well done.  
PETE: Right, I'd better shift. I've got a wedding to go to.  
ROSE: Is that Sarah Clarke's wedding?  
PETE: Yeah, are you going?  
ROSE: Yeah.  
PETE: You and your boyfriend need a lift?  
(Something with blood red eyesight flies over South London.)

**[The Tyler's flat]**

PETE: Right, there we go. Sorry about the mess. If you want a cup of tea, the
kitchens just down there, milk's in the fridge. Well, it would be, wouldn't
it. Where else would you put the milk? Mind you, there's always the window
sill outside. I always thought if someone invented a window sill with special
compartments, you know, one for milk, one for yogurt, make a lot of money out
of that. Sell it to students and things. I should write that down. Anyway,
never mind that, excuse me for a minute. Got to go and change.  
(Pete goes to the bedroom.)  
ROSE: All the stuff mum kept. His stuff. She kept it all packed away in boxes
in the cupboard. She used to show me when she'd had a bit to drink. Here it
is, on display. Where it should be. Third prize at the bowling. First two got
to go to Didcot. Health drinks. Tonics, mum used to call them. He made his
money selling this Vitex stuff. He had all sorts of jobs. He was so clever.
Solar power. Mum said he was going to do this. Now he can. Okay, look I'll
tell him you're not my boyfriend.  
DOCTOR: When we met, I said travel with me in space. You said no. Then I said
time machine.  
ROSE: It wasn't some big plan. I just saw it happening and I thought, I can
stop it.  
DOCTOR: I did it again. I picked another stupid ape. I should've known. It's
not about showing you the universe. It never is. It's about the universe doing
something for you.  
ROSE: So it's okay when you go to other times, and you save people's lives,
but not when it's me saving my dad.  
DOCTOR: I know what I'm doing, you don't. Two sets of us being there made that
a vulnerable point.  
ROSE: But he's alive!  
DOCTOR: My entire planet died. My whole family. Do you think it never occurred
to me to go back and save them?  
ROSE: But it's not like I've changed history. Not much. I mean he's never
going to be a world leader. He's not going to start World War Three or
anything.  
DOCTOR: Rose, there's a man alive in the world who wasn't alive before. An
ordinary man. That's the most important thing in creation. The whole world's
different because he's alive.  
ROSE: What, would you rather him dead?  
DOCTOR: I'm not saying that.  
ROSE: No, I get it! For once, you're not the most important man in my life.  
DOCTOR: Let's see how you get on without me, then. Give me the key. The Tardis
key. If I'm so insignificant, give it me back.  
ROSE: All right then, I will.  
(Rose hands over the key.)  
DOCTOR: You've got what you wanted, so that's goodbye, then.  
ROSE: You don't scare me. I know how sad you are. You'll be back in a minute,
or you'll hang around outside the Tardis waiting for me. And I'll make you
wait a long time!  
(The Doctor leaves and Rose slams the door behind him. Pete puts his head
round the bedroom door.)  
PETE: Boyfriend trouble?  
(The red-eyed thing flies over the area, then a man clipping a shrub suddenly
disappears with a brief scream, followed by a woman pegging out the washing
and a tramp drinking cider. Indoors, Rose is putting peanuts back into their
bowl. Pete has changed into his wedding suit.)  
PETE: Excuse me, do you mind? What're you tidying up for?  
ROSE: Sorry. Force of habit.  
PETE: Listen, don't worry about him. Couples have rows all the time.  
ROSE: We're not a couple. Why does everyone think we're a couple? I think he
left me.  
PETE: What, a pretty girl like you? If I was going out with you  
ROSE: Stop right there.  
PETE: I was just saying  
ROSE: I know what you're saying, and we're not going there. At no point are we
going anywhere near there. You aren't even aware that there exists. I don't
even want to think about there, and believe me, neither do you. There for you
is like, like the Bermuda Triangle.  
PETE: Blimey, you know how to flatter a bloke.  
ROSE: Right, are we off?  
(Rose offers Pete her arm.)  
PETE: So, that wouldn't be a mixed signal at all?  
ROSE: Absolutely not.  
PETE: I'll take you back to the loony bin where you belong. Except I'm sure
I've met you somewhere before.

**[St Pauls Church]**

(The nervous groom is waiting for the bride to turn up. A few guests are
scattered in the pews.)  
STUART: It's weird.  
DAD: What?  
STUART: There's so many people missing. Uncle Steven, Auntie Lynn, all the
Baxters. Where are they? You don't think something's gone wrong?  
DAD: Maybe it's a godsend. It gives you time to think. You don't have to go
through with it, not these days. Live in sin for a bit.  
STUART: Dad  
DAD: In ten years time, you'll turn round and say, if only I could turn the
clock back. Is it me or did it just get cold?

**[Waterley Street]**

(The Doctor outside the Tardis when he looks up for a moment. He unlocks the
doors and opens them to reveal an empty police telephone box. The Tardis
interior is missing.)  
DOCTOR: Rose!

**[Pete's car]**

PETE: I met this bloke at the horse's, and he's cutting me in on copyright.  
ROSE: But I thought you were a proper businessman and that.  
PETE: I wish! Oh, I do a bit of this, a bit of that. I scrape by.  
ROSE: Right. So I must've heard wrong. So, really you're a bit of a Del Boy?  
PETE: Oh, shoot me down in flames. You're not related to my wife by any
chance, are you?  
ROSE: Oh, my God. She's going to be at the wedding.  
PETE: What, Jackie? Do you know her?  
ROSE: Sort of.  
PETE: What's she told you about me, then?  
ROSE: She said she'd picked the most fantastic man in the world.  
PETE: Must be a different Jackie, then. She'd never say that.  
(The radio changes to 105.4FM, and rap music comes out. I am reliably informed
that it is Don't Mug Yourself, by The Streets.)  
PETE: This stuff goes right over my head.  
ROSE: That's not out yet.  
PETE: It's a good job and all.  
ROSE; I'm just going to check my messages.  
PETE: How do you mean, messages? Is that a phone?  
ROSE: Yeah.  
BELL [OC]: Watson, come here. I need you. Watson, come here. I need you.
Watson, come here. I need you.  
(The car that should have killed Pete is behind them. Pete turns a corner, it
drives straight on then vanishes.)

**[Outside St Pauls Church]**

(Stuart's dad is using a proper mobile phone of the time - the size of a
brick. Guests are entering and the bridesmaids are just arriving.)  
DAD: Half the guests haven't turned up. You're better off not being here, it's
a disaster in the making. No, in this case, knocked her up is a phrase I'd
use.  
BELL [OC]: Watson, come here. I need you.  
DAD: Hello? Who is this?  
BELL [OC]: Watson, come here. I ne  
(He tries redialing. Stuart comes out of the church.)  
STUART: Dad, get inside. We can't see the bride before the wedding. It's bad
luck.  
DAD: It was bad luck when you met her. I tell you, this day is cursed.  
(They go back inside. The bride arrives. Her dress is a mass of Lady Di
flounces.)  
BEV: Now, that's what I call a meringue.  
SUZIE: Listen, Stuart's dad said and go round the block, cos there's people
missing.  
SARAH: How do you mean, missing?  
BEV: There's no Dave, no Sunita, no Bea.  
SUZIE: There's no one from the Lamb and Flag.  
SARAH: Oh, my train's detached again. I knew I should've used Velcro.  
JACKIE: I'm here. Stop your bellyaching. Take Rose a sec, will you?  
(Jackie hands over a baby in a carry cot.)  
BEV: Oh, ain't she pretty?  
JACKIE: She's a little madam, that's what she is. Oh, I need more hands.
Where's her useless article of a dad got to?  
(Pete drives round the corner.)

**[Pete's car]**

(The beige car suddenly appears and drives towards them.)  
ROSE: Dad!  
(Pete swerves into the kerb, missing a tree.)  
PETE: It's that car. Same one as before.

**[Outside St Pauls Church]**

PETE: It was right in front of us. Where's he gone? You called me Dad. What'd
you say that for?  
JACKIE: Oh, wonderful. Here he is, the accident waiting to happen. You'd be
late for your own funeral and it nearly was!  
PETE: No damage done.  
JACKIE: And who's this? What're you looking at with your mouth open?  
ROSE: Your hair.  
JACKIE: What?!  
ROSE: I've never seen it like. I mean, it's lovely. Your hair's lovely. And
that baby you're holding. That would be your baby.  
JACKIE: Another one of yours, is she?  
PETE: She saved my life!  
JACKIE: Oh, that's a new one. What was it last time?  
PETE: I didn't even know her. She was a cloakroom attendant. I was helping her
look for my ticket. There were three duffel coats all the same. Somehow the
rack collapsed. We were under all this stuff.  
ROSE: Were you playing around?  
JACKIE: What's it got to do with you what he gets up to?  
ROSE: What does he get up to?  
JACKIE: You'd know.  
PETE: Oh, 'cos I'm that stupid. I play around and I bring her to meet the
missus. You silly cow.  
JACKIE: But you are that stupid.  
PETE: Can we keep this stuff back home just for now?  
JACKIE: What, with the rest of the rubbish? You bring home cut-price
detergents, tonic water, Betamax tapes and none of it works. I'm drowning in
your rubbish. What did he tell you? Did he say he's this big businessman, 'cos
he's not. He's a failure. Born failure, that one. Rose needs a proper father,
not one who's flannelling about like some big kid.  
PETE: Jackie, I'm making a living, it keeps us fed, don't it?  
ROSE: Stop it!  
ROSE: You're not like this. You love each other.  
JACKIE: Oh, Pete. You never used to like them mental. Or I don't know, maybe
you did.  
PETE: Jackie, wait, just listen.  
JACKIE: If you're not careful, there'll be a wedding and a divorce on the same
day.  
PETE: Wait here. Give us a couple of minutes with the missus. Tell you what,
straighten the car up. Stick it round the corner or something. Don't cause
anymore trouble.  
(Pete takes the vase and gives Rose his car keys.)

**[Playground]**

(The red-eyed monster hovers over a playground. A woman is pushing her son on
the swing. From the colour of his skin we can guess who this should be.)  
MICKEY: Hey, Jack. Jeff.  
(But the boy on the slide and the two on the see-saw have just vanished. Then
his mother isn't behind him any more either. Mickey runs.)

**[Outside St Pauls Church]**

JACKIE: I'm not listening. It's just the duffel coats all over again.  
PETE: Jackie, sometimes a duffel coat is just a duffel coat. Things will get
better soon, I promise.  
JACKIE: I've had enough of all your daft schemes. I never know where the next
meal's coming from.  
PETE: I'll get it right, love. One day soon, I promise you, I'll get it right.
Come on.  
(The little boy runs round the corner from Waterley Street.)  
MICKEY: Monsters! Going to eat us!  
SUZIE: What sort of monsters, sweetheart? Is it aliens?  
(Mickey runs straight into the church. The Doctor runs up behind Rose.)  
DOCTOR: Rose! Get in the church!  
(A large thing with bat-like wings appears in the sky. Very devilish. It
hisses and starts to swoop. Rose screams. The Doctor pushes her to the
pavement just in time to avoid its talons.)  
DOCTOR: Get in the church!  
(Two more appear.)  
SUZIE: Oh, my God. What are they? What are they?  
DOCTOR: Inside!  
STUART: Sarah!  
DOCTOR: Stay in there!  
(Stuart's dad tries to run away, but he gets pounced on. Another blocks
Sarah's path to the church, but when she screams it flies off and pounces on
the vicar instead.)  
DOCTOR: In!

**[St Pauls Church]**

(The Doctor gets the bride's party inside and slams the doors on the
creatures. They can be seen flying around outside.)  
DOCTOR: They can't get in. Old windows and doors. Okay. The older something
is, the stronger it is. What else? Go and check the other doors! Move!  
JACKIE: What's happening? What are they? What are they?  
DOCTOR: There's been an accident in time. A wound in time. They're like
bacteria, taking advantage.  
JACKIE: What do you mean, time? What're you jabbering on about, time?  
DOCTOR: Oh, I might've known you'd argue. Jackie, I'm sick of you complaining.  
JACKIE: How do you know my name?  
DOCTOR: I haven't got time for this.  
JACKIE: I've never met you in my life!  
DOCTOR: No, and you never will unless I sort this out. Now, if you don't mind,
I've waited a long time to say this. Jackie Tyler, do as I say. Go and check
the doors.  
JACKIE: Yes, sir.  
DOCTOR: I should have done that ages ago.  
STUART: My dad was out there.  
DOCTOR: You can mourn him later. Right now we've got to concentrate on keeping
ourselves alive.  
STUART: My dad had  
DOCTOR: There's nothing I can do for him.  
STUART: No, but he had this phone thing. I can't get it to work. I keep
getting this voice.  
BELL [OC]: Watson, come here. I need you. Watson, come here. I need you.  
DOCTOR: That's the very first phone call. Alexander Graham Bell. I don't think
the telephone's going to be much use.  
STUART: But someone must have called the police.  
DOCTOR: Police can't help you now. No one can. Nothing in this universe can
harm those things. Time's been damaged and they've come to sterilise the
wound. By consuming everything inside.  
ROSE: Is this because? Is this my fault?

**[Outside St Pauls Church]**

(The creatures take passers-by.)  
WOMAN: No!  
(Cars have crashed. A pram is overturned. Bicycle wheels turn then stop. Shoes
blow with the autumn leaves.)

**[Vestry]**

(All laid out for the signing of the register.)  
PETE: There's smoke coming up from the city but no sirens. I don't think it's
just us. I think these things are all over the place. Maybe the whole world.  
(The beige car appears at the corner, turns, the driver covers his face and it
disappears again.)  
PETE: Was that a car?  
DOCTOR: It's not important. Don't worry about it.

**[St Pauls Church]**

(Rose is standing by the altar when Pete comes out of the vestry.)  
PETE: This mate of yours. What did he mean, this is your fault?  
ROSE: Don't know. Just everything.  
PETE: I gave you my car keys. You don't give your keys to a complete stranger.
It's, it's like I trusted you. Moment I met you, I just did. wound in time.
You called me Dad. I can see it. My eyes, Jackie's attitude. You sound like
her when you shout. You are. You are. You're my Rose. You're my Rose grown up.  
(They hug, in tears.)  
ROSE: Dad. My Dad. My Daddy.  
(Meanwhile, a creature is head-butting a side door. The Doctor pulls the
curtain aside and gets out his sonic screwdriver.)  
STUART: Excuse me, Mister  
DOCTOR: Doctor.  
STUART: You seem to know what's going on.  
DOCTOR: I give that impression, yeah.  
STUART: I just wanted to ask  
SARAH: Can you save us?  
DOCTOR: Who are you two, then?  
STUART: Stuart Hoskins.  
SARAH: Sarah Clark.  
DOCTOR: And one extra. Boy or girl?  
SARAH: I don't know. I don't want to know, really.  
DOCTOR: How did all this get started?  
STUART: Outside the Beatbox Club, two in the morning.  
SARAH: Street corner. I'd lost my purse, didn't have money for a taxi.  
STUART: I took her home.  
DOCTOR: Then what? Asked her for a date?  
SARAH: Wrote his number on the back of my hand.  
STUART: Never got rid of her since. My dad said.  
SARAH: I don't know what this is all about, and I know we're not important.  
DOCTOR: Who said you're not important? I've travelled to all sorts of places,
done things you couldn't even imagine, but you two. Street corner, two in the
morning, getting a taxi home. I've never had a life like that. Yes. I'll try
and save you.

**[Vestry]**

PETE: I'm a dad. I mean, I'm already a dad, but Rose grows up and she's you.
That's wonderful. I mean, I suppose I thought that you'd be a bit useless,
what with my useless genes and all, but. Well, I mean, how did you get here?  
ROSE: Do you really want to know?  
PETE: Yeah.  
ROSE: A time machine.  
PETE: Time machine.  
ROSE: Cross my heart.  
PETE: What, do you all have time machines where you come from?  
ROSE: No, just the Doctor.  
PETE: Did you know these things were coming?  
ROSE: No.  
PETE: God, I don't know, my head's spinning. What's the future like?  
ROSE: It's not so different.  
PETE: What am I like? Have I gone grey? Have I gone bald? Don't tell me I've
gone bald. So, if this mate of yours isn't your boyfriend and I have to say,
I'm glad, because being your dad and all, I think he's a bit old for you. Have
you got a bloke?  
ROSE: No, I did have.  
JACKIE [OC]: Mickey!  
(Little Mickey runs up to Rose and hugs her.)  
PETE: Do you know him?  
ROSE: I just didn't recognise him in a suit. You have to let go of me,
sweetheart. I'm always saying that.  
JACKIE: He just grabs hold of what's passing and holds on for dear life. God
help his poor girlfriend if he ever gets one.  
PETE: Me and Rose were just talking.  
JACKIE: Oh, yeah? Talking? While the world comes to an end, what do you do?
Cling to the youngest blonde. Come on, Mick.  
(Jackie and Mickey leave.)  
ROSE: You can't tell her.  
PETE: Why?  
ROSE: I mean, I really don't want you to tell her.  
PETE: What, do you don't want people to know?  
ROSE: Where I come from, Jackie doesn't know how to work the timer on the
video recorder.  
PETE: I showed her that last week. Point taken.

**[St Pauls Church]**

(The Doctor is talking to baby Rose in her carrycot by the choir stalls.)  
DOCTOR: Now, Rose you're not going to bring about the end of the world, are
you? Are you?  
(Rose walks up.)  
DOCTOR: Jackie gave her to me to look after. How times change.  
ROSE: I'd better be careful. I think I just imprinted myself on Mickey like a
mother chicken.  
DOCTOR: No. Don't touch the baby. You're both the same person. That's a
paradox, and we don't want a paradox happening, not with these things outside.
Anything new, any disturbance in time makes them stronger. The paradox might
let them in.  
ROSE: Can't do anything right, can I?  
DOCTOR: Since you ask, no. So, don't touch the baby.  
ROSE: I'm not stupid.  
DOCTOR: You could have fooled me. All right, I'm sorry. I wasn't really going
to leave you on your own.  
ROSE: I know.  
DOCTOR: But between you and me, I haven't got a plan. No idea. No way out.  
ROSE: You'll think of something.  
DOCTOR: The entire Earth's been sterilised. This, and other place like it, are
all that's left of the human race. We might hold out for a while, but nothing
can stop those creatures. They'll get through in the end. The walls aren't
that old. And there's nothing I can do to stop them. There used to be laws
stopping this kind of thing from happening. My people would have stopped this.
But they're all gone. And now I'm going the same way.  
ROSE: If I'd realised.  
DOCTOR: Just tell me you're sorry.  
ROSE: I am. I'm sorry.  
(They hug.)  
ROSE: Have you got something hot?  
(She reaches into his inside pocket, takes out a key and drops it because it
is glowing hot.)  
DOCTOR: It's the Tardis key!  
(He takes off his jacket to pick it up safely.)  
DOCTOR: It's telling me it's still connected to the Tardis.  
(He makes an announcement from the pulpit.)  
DOCTOR: The inside of my ship was thrown out of the wound but we can use this
to bring it back. And once I've got my ship back, then I can mend everything.
Now, I just need a bit of power. Has anybody got a battery?  
(Stuart picks up the mobile phone.)  
STUART: This one big enough?  
DOCTOR: Fantastic.  
STUART: Good old dad. There you go.  
DOCTOR: Just need to do a bit of charging up and then we can bring everyone
back.  
(He uses the ever-versatile sonic screwdriver while the creatures batter at
the doors. Pete and Rose have a quiet chat.)  
PETE: You, er, you never said why you came here in the first place. If I had a
time machine, I wouldn't have thought 1987 was anything special. Not round
here, anyway.  
ROSE: We just ended up here.  
PETE: Lucky for me, eh? If you hadn't been there to save me.  
ROSE: That was just a coincidence. That was just really good luck. It's
amazing.  
PETE: So, in the future, are me and her indoors still together?  
ROSE: Yeah.  
PETE: Are you still living with us?  
ROSE: Yep.  
PETE: Am I a good dad?  
ROSE: You, you told me a bedtime story every night when I was small. You were
always there. You never missed one. And er, you took us for picnics in the
country every Saturday. You never let us down. You were there for us all the
time. Someone I could really rely on.  
PETE: That's not me.  
(The Tardis slowly materialises around her key.)  
DOCTOR: Right, no one touches that key. Have you got that? Don't touch it.
Anyone touches that key, it'll be, well, zap. Just leave it be and everything
will be fine. We'll get out of here. All of us. Stuart, Sarah you're going to
get married, just like I said.  
(Outside, the car repeats its brief drive around the corner. Inside, the
Tardis is fading in and out.)  
ROSE: When time gets sorted out  
DOCTOR: Everybody here forgets what happened. And don't worry, the thing that
you changed will stay changed.  
PETE: You mean I'll still be alive, though I'm meant to be dead. That's why I
haven't done anything with my life, why I didn't mean anything.  
DOCTOR: It doesn't work like that.  
PETE: Rubbish. I'm so useless I couldn't even die properly. Now it's my fault
all of this has happened.  
ROSE: This is my fault.  
PETE: No, love. I'm your dad. It's my job for it to be my fault.  
JACKIE: Her dad? How are you her dad? How old were you, twelve? Oh, that's
disgusting.  
PETE: Jacks, listen. This is Rose.  
JACKIE: Rose? How sick is that? You give my daughter a second hand name? How
many are there? Do you call them all Rose?  
PETE: Oh, for God's sake, look. It's the same Rose!  
(Pete takes baby Rose from Jackie and hands her to Rose.)  
DOCTOR: Rose! No!  
(The Doctor snatches her away too late and gives her back to Jackie. A
creature appears inside the Church.)  
DOCTOR: Everyone, behind me! I'm the oldest thing in here.  
ROSE: Doctor!  
(The creature pounces on the Doctor, then flies over to the Tardis. They
touch, the Tardis and the creature vanish, and the key falls to the floor.
Rose runs to pick it up.)  
ROSE: It's cold. The key's cold. Oh, my God, he's dead. This is all my fault.
Both of you. All of you. The whole world.  
BEV: This is it. There's nothing we can do. It's the end.  
(As the creatures start scraping at the stonework outside, Pete watches the
car drive around the corner again and again from the vestry window. He goes
back into the church and over to Rose, who is sitting on her own.)  
PETE: The Doctor really cared about you. He didn't want you to go through it
again, not if there was another way. Now there isn't.  
ROSE: What are you talking about?  
PETE: The car that should have killed me, love. It's here. The Doctor worked
it out way back, but he, er, he tried to protect me. Still, he's not in charge
anymore. I am.  
ROSE: But you can't.  
PETE: Who am I, love?  
ROSE: My daddy.  
PETE: Jackie, look at her. She's ours.  
JACKIE: Oh, of course.  
(Jackie hugs the weeping Rose.)  
PETE: I'm meant to be dead, Jackie. You're going to get rid of me at last.  
JACKIE: Don't say that.  
PETE: For once in your life, trust me. It's got be done. You've got to
survive, because you've got to bring up our daughter. I never read you those
bedtime stories. I never took you on those picnics. I was never there for you.  
ROSE: You would have been.  
PETE: But I can do this for you. I can be a proper dad to you now.  
ROSE: But it's not fair.  
PETE: I've had all these extra hours. No one else in the world has ever had
that. And on top of that, I got to see you. And you're beautiful. How lucky am
I, eh? So, come on, do as your dad says. You going to be there for me, love?
Thanks for saving me.

**[Outside St Pauls Church]**

(Pete runs out of the church, clutching the vase. A creature spots him. He
runs to the corner, where the car appears. The driver flings his arm across
his face.)  
PETE: Goodbye, love.  
(Thump! The vase drops and breaks. The creatures vanish.)

**[St Pauls Church]**

DOCTOR: Go to him. Quick.

**[Outside St Pauls Church]**

(Rose runs to her dying father. This time, the driver has stopped at the
scene. Pete dies gazing into Rose's eyes.)  
SARAH: What's that?  
(Stuart's dad comes out of the church.)  
JACKIE [OC]: The driver was just a kid.

**[Memory - Jackie's bedroom]**

JACKIE: He stopped, he waited for the police. It wasn't his fault. For some
reason, Pete just ran out. People say there was this girl, and she sat with
Pete while he was dying. She held his hand. Then she was gone. Never found out
who she was.

**[Jordan Road]**

(Rose kisses Pete farewell then stands up and looks at the Doctor.)  
ROSE [OC]: Peter Alan Tyler, my dad. The most wonderful man in the world. Died
the 7th of November, 1987.  
(The Tardis has relocated to outside the Tandoori across the road. The Doctor
and Rose walk away.)
