**The Parting of the Ways**  
  
Original Airdate: 18 Jun, 2005  

**[Spaceship]**

DALEK: You know the Doctor. You understand him. You will predict his actions.  
ROSE: I don't know! And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.  
DALEK: Predict! Predict! Predict!  
DALEK 2: Tardis detected in flight.  
DALEK: Launch missiles. Exterminate.  
ROSE: You can't! The Tardis hasn't got any defences. You're going to kill him.  
DALEK: You have predicted correctly.

**[Tardis]**

JACK: We've got incoming!  
(The Dalek missiles strike the Tardis, and there is a big fireball in the
vacuum of space. Neat trick.)  
JACK: The extrapolator's working. We've got a fully functional forcefield. Try
saying that when you're drunk.  
DOCTOR: And for my next trick.  
(The Tardis materialises around Rose and the nearest Dalek.)  
DOCTOR: Rose, get down! Get down, Rose!  
DALEK: Exterminate!  
(The Dalek fires and misses. Jack takes out the Dalek with the modified
Defabricator.)  
ROSE: You did it.  
(The Doctor hugs Rose.)  
ROSE: Feels like I haven't seem you in years.  
DOCTOR: I told you I'd come and get you.  
ROSE: Never doubted it.  
DOCTOR: I did. You all right?  
ROSE: Yeah. You?  
DOCTOR: Not bad, been better.  
JACK: Hey, don't I get a hug?  
ROSE: Oh, come here!  
JACK: I was talking to him.  
(Jack hugs Rose anyway.)  
JACK: Welcome home.  
ROSE: Oh, I thought I'd never see you again.  
JACK: Oh, you were lucky. That was just a one shot wonder. Drained the gun of
all its power supply. Now it's just a piece of junk.

**[Spaceship]**

EMPEROR [OC]: Patience, my brethren.

**[Tardis]**

ROSE: You said they were extinct. How comes they're still alive?  
JACK: One minute they're the greatest threat in the Universe, the next minute
they vanished out of time and space.  
DOCTOR: They went off to fight a bigger war. The Time War  
JACK: I thought that was just a legend.  
DOCTOR: I was there. The war between the Daleks and the Time Lords, with the
whole of creation at stake. My people were destroyed, but they took the Daleks
with them. I almost thought it was worth it. Now it turns out they died for
nothing.  
ROSE: There's thousands of them now. We could hardly stop one. What're we
going to do?  
DOCTOR: No good stood round here chin wagging. Human race, you'd gossip all
day. The Daleks have got the answers. Let's go and meet the neighbours.  
ROSE: You can't go out there!

**[Spaceship]**

DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!  
(The Dalek rays are stopped by a forcefield extending a good three metres out
from the Tardis.)  
DOCTOR: Is that it? Useless! Nul points. It's all right, come on out. That
forcefield can hold back anything.  
JACK: Almost anything.  
DOCTOR: Yes, but I wasn't going to tell them that. Thanks.  
JACK: Sorry.  
DOCTOR: Do you know what they call me in the ancient legends of the Dalek
Homeworld? The Oncoming Storm. You might've removed all your emotions but I
reckon right down deep in your DNA, there's one little spark left, and that's
fear. Doesn't it just burn when you face me? So tell me. How did you survive
the Time War?  
EMPEROR [OC]: They survived through me.  
(The lights come up to reveal a large apparatus, which on closer inspection is
an exploded giant Dalek casing, and a blue-skinned one-eyed mutant is happy
for everyone to see it sitting there as if on its throne..)  
DOCTOR: Rose, Captain, this is the Emperor of the Daleks.  
EMPEROR: You destroyed us, Doctor. The Dalek race died in your inferno, but my
ship survived, falling through time, crippled but alive.  
DOCTOR: I get it.  
DALEK: Do not interrupt.  
DALEK 2: Do not interrupt.  
DALEK 3: Do not interrupt.  
DOCTOR: I think you're forgetting something. I'm the Doctor, and if there's
one thing I can do, it's talk. I've got five billion languages, and you
haven't got one way of stopping me. So if anybody's going to shut up, it's
you! Okey doke. So, where were we?  
EMPEROR: We waited here in the dark space, damaged but rebuilding. Centuries
passed, and we quietly infiltrated the systems of Earth, harvesting the waste
of humanity. The prisoners, the refugees, the dispossessed. They all came to
us. The bodies were filtered, pulped, sifted. The seed of the human race is
perverted. Only one cell in a billion was fit to be nurtured.  
DOCTOR: So you created an army of Daleks out of the dead.  
ROSE: That makes them half human.  
EMPEROR: Those words are blasphemy.  
DALEK: Do not blaspheme.  
DALEK 2: Do not blaspheme.  
DALEK 3: Do not blaspheme.  
EMPEROR: Everything human has been purged. I cultivated pure and blessed
Dalek.  
DOCTOR: Since when did the Daleks have a concept of blasphemy?  
EMPEROR: I reached into the dirt and made new life. I am the God of all
Daleks!  
DALEKS: Worship him. Worship him. Worship him.  
DOCTOR: They're insane. Hiding in silence for hundreds of years, that's enough
to drive anyone mad. But it's worse than that. Driven mad by your own flesh.
The stink of humanity. You hate your own existence. And that makes them more
deadly than ever. We're going.  
EMPEROR: You may not leave my presence.  
DALEK: Stay where you are.  
DALEKS: Exterminate!  
(The Doctor, Rose and Jack go back inside the Tardis. The Daleks start
shooting at the forcefield again.)  
DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate!

**[Tardis]**

DALEKS [OC]: Exterminate! Exterminate! Worship him! You will be exterminated!

**[Floor 500]**

(The Tardis materialises.)  
DOCTOR: Turn everything up. All transmitters full power, wide open. Now! Do
it!  
PAVALE: What does this do?  
DOCTOR: Stops the Daleks from transmatting on board. How did you get on? Did
you contact Earth?  
PAVALE: Well, we tried to warn them, but all they did was suspend our license
because we stopped the programmes.  
DOCTOR: And the planet's just sitting there, defenceless. Lynda, what're you
still doing on board? I told you to evacuate everyone.  
PAVALE: She wouldn't go.  
LYNDA: Didn't want to leave you.  
WOMAN: There weren't enough shuttles anyway, or I wouldn't be here. We've got
about a hundred people stranded on Floor Zero.

**[Floor Zero]**

RODRICK: Listen, listen. My name's Rodrick. I won the game! Where's my money?
Is anyone listening? Where's my money?!

**[Floor 500]**

PAVALE: Oh, my God. The Fleet is moving. They're on their way.

**[Spaceship]**

EMPEROR: Purify the Earth with fire. The planet will become my temple and we
shall rise. This will be our paradise.

**[Floor 500]**

(The Doctor is pulling bits out of the conduits.)  
DOCTOR: Dalek plan. Big mistake, because what have they left me with? Anyone?
Anyone? Oh, come on, it's obvious. A great big transmitter. This station. If I
can change the signal, fold it back, sequence it, anyone?  
JACK: You've got to be kidding.  
DOCTOR: Give the man a medal.  
JACK: A Delta Wave?  
DOCTOR: A Delta Wave!  
ROSE: What's a Delta Wave?  
JACK: A wave of Van Cassadyne energy. It fries your brain. Stand in the way of
a Delta Wave and your head gets barbequed.  
DOCTOR: And this place can transmit a massive wave. Wipe out the Daleks!  
LYNDA: Well, get started and do it then.  
DOCTOR: Trouble is, wave this size, building this big, brain as clever as
mine, should take about, oh, three days? How long till the Fleet arrive?  
PAVALE: Twenty two minutes.  
(Later, after some rerouting of bits and pieces.)  
JACK: We've now got a forcefield so they can't blast us out of the sky, but
that doesn't stop the Daleks from physically invading.  
PAVALE: Do they know about the Delta Wave?  
JACK: They'll have worked it out at the same time. So, they want to stop the
Doctor. That means they've got to get to this level, five hundred. Now, I can
concentrate the extrapolator around the top six levels, five hundred to four
nine five. So they'll penetrate the station below that at level four nine four
and fight their way up.  
PAVALE: Who are they fighting?  
JACK: Us.  
PAVALE: And what are we fighting with?  
JACK: The guards had guns with bastic bullets. That's enough to blow a Dalek
wide open.  
WOMAN: There's five of us.  
DOCTOR: Rose, you can help me. I need all these wires stripping bare.  
WOMAN: Right, now there's four of us.  
JACK: Then let's move it. Into the lift. Isolate the lift controls.  
(Pavale and his colleague run off.)  
LYNDA: I just want to say, er, thanks, I suppose, and I'll do my best.  
DOCTOR: Me too.  
(They shake hands and Lynda moves away.)  
JACK: It's been fun, but I guess this is goodbye.  
ROSE: Don't talk like that. The Doctor's going to do it. You just watch him.  
JACK: Rose, you are worth fighting for. (kisses her) Wish I'd never met you,
Doctor. I was much better off as a coward.  
(Jack kisses the Doctor.)  
JACK: See you in hell.  
(Jack leaves.)  
ROSE: He's going to be all right, isn't he?

**[Floor Zero]**

(Jack stands on a pile of crates and fires a machine gun into the air to get
some attention.)  
JACK: One last time! Any more volunteers? There's an army about to invade this
station. I need every last citizen to mount a defence.  
RODRICK: Don't listen to him. There aren't any Daleks. They disappeared
thousands of years ago.  
(The Floor Manager volunteers.)  
JACK: Thanks. As for the rest of you, the Daleks will enter the station at
floor four nine four and as far as I can tell, they'll head up, not down. But
that's not a promise. So here's a few words of advice. Keep quiet. And if you
hear fighting up above, if you hear us dying, then tell me that the Daleks
aren't real. Don't make a sound. Let's go.  
(Jack, Lynda and the few volunteers all get in the lift.)

**[Floor 500]**

ROSE: Suppose.  
DOCTOR: What?  
ROSE: Nothing.  
DOCTOR: You said suppose.  
ROSE: No, I was just thinking. I mean, obviously you can't, but, you've got a
time machine. Why can't you just go back to last week and warn them?  
DOCTOR: As soon as the Tardis lands in that second, I become part of events,
stuck in the timeline.  
ROSE: Yeah, thought it'd be something like that  
DOCTOR: There's another thing the Tardis could do. It could take us away. We
could leave. Let history take its course. We go to Marbella in 1989\.  
ROSE: Yeah, but you'd never do that.  
DOCTOR: No, but you could ask. Never even occurred to you, did it?  
ROSE: Well, I'm just too good.  
DOCTOR: The Delta Wave's started building. How long does it need?  
(They run over to a console.)  
ROSE: Is that bad? Okay, it's bad. How bad is it?  
DOCTOR: Rose Tyler, you're a genius! We can do it. If I use the Tardis to
cross my old timeline. Yes!

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: Hold that down and keep position.  
ROSE: What's it do?  
DOCTOR: Cancels the buffers. If I'm very clever and I'm more than clever, I'm
brilliant, I might just save the world. Or rip it apart  
ROSE: I'd go for the first one.  
DOCTOR: Me too. Now, I've just got to go and power up the Game Station. Hold
on!  
(The Doctor runs out and stops in the midst of his mares-nest of cables. He
looks back at the Tardis then points the sonic screwdriver at it. The engines
start.)  
ROSE: Doctor, what're you doing? Can I take my hand off? It's moving.  
(Rose runs to the door.)  
ROSE: Doctor, let me out!

**[Floor 500]**

ROSE [OC]: Let me out! Doctor, what've you done?  
(The Tardis dematerialises.)

**[Tardis]**

(A hologram appears.)  
HOLO-DOCTOR: This is Emergency Programme One. Rose, now listen, this is
important. If this message is activated, then it can only mean one thing. We
must be in danger. And I mean fatal. I'm dead or about to die any second with
no chance of escape.  
ROSE: No!  
DOCTOR: And that's okay. Hope it's a good death. But I promised to look after
you, and that's what I'm doing. The Tardis is taking you home.  
ROSE: I won't let you.  
HOLO-DOCTOR: And I bet you're fussing and moaning now. Typical. But hold on
and just listen a bit more. The Tardis can never return for me. Emergency
Programme One means I'm facing an enemy that should never get their hands on
this machine. So this is what you should do. Let the Tardis die. Just let this
old box gather dust. No one can open it. No one'll even notice it. Let it
become a strange little thing standing on a street corner. And over the years,
the world'll move on and the box will be buried. And if you want to remember
me, then you can do one thing. That's all, one thing. Have a good life. Do
that for me, Rose. Have a fantastic life.  
(The hologram flickers out.)  
ROSE: You can't do this to me. You can't. Take me back! Take me back! No!  
(Rose tries to use the controls, but the engine stops. She runs outside into
the Powell Estate, then back inside.)  
ROSE: Come on, fly. How do you fly? Come on, help me!

**[Powell Estate]**

(Rose finally gives up and goes outside. Mickey comes running down the road.)  
MICKEY: I knew it! I was all the way down Clifton Parade, and I heard the
engines. I thought, there's only one thing that makes a noise like that. What
is it?  
(Rose hugs him, in tears.)

**[Floor 494]**

JACK: Rose, I've called up the internal laser codes.

**[Floor 500]**

JACK [OC]: There should be a different number on every screen. Can you read
them out to me?  
DOCTOR: She's not here.

**[Floor 494]**

JACK: Of all the times to take a leak.

**[Floor 500]**

JACK [on viewscreen]: When she gets back, tell her to read me the codes.  
DOCTOR: She's not coming back.

**[Floor 494]**

JACK: What do you mean? Where'd she go?

**[Floor 500]**

DOCTOR: Just get on with your work.  
JACK [on viewscreen]: You took her home, didn't you?  
DOCTOR: Yeah.

**[Floor 494]**

JACK: The Delta Wave.

**[Floor 500]**

JACK [OC]: Is it ever going to be ready?  
EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: Tell him the truth, Doctor. There is every
possibility the Delta Wave could be complete, but no possibility of refining
it. The Delta Wave must kill every living thing in its path, with no
distinction between human and Dalek.

**[Floor 494]**

EMPEROR [OC]: All things will die

**[Floor 500]**

EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: By your hand.  
JACK [on viewscreen]: Doctor, the range of this transmitter covers the entire
Earth.  
EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: You would destroy Daleks and Humans together. If I am
God, the creator of all things, then what does that make you, Doctor?  
DOCTOR: There are colonies out there. The Human Race would survive in some
shape or form, but you're the only Daleks in existence. The whole Universe is
in danger

**[Floor 494]**

DOCTOR [OC]: If I let you live.

**[Floor 500]**

DOCTOR: Do you see, Jack? That's the decision I've got to make for every
living thing. Die as a human or live as a Dalek. What would you do?  
JACK [on viewscreen]: You sent her home. She's safe. Keep working.

**[Spaceship]**

EMPEROR: But he will exterminate you!

**[Floor 494]**

JACK: Never doubted him.

**[Floor 500]**

JACK [OC]: Never will.  
DOCTOR: Now, you tell me, God of all Daleks, because there's one thing I never
worked out. The words Bad Wolf, spread across time and space, everywhere,
drawing me in. How'd you manage that?  
EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: I did nothing.  
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, there's no secrets now, your worship.

**[Spaceship]**

EMPEROR: They are not part of my design. This is the Truth of God. (The Doctor
looks up at the BadWolf Corporation sign on the wall.)

**[Cafe]**

(Whole chickens turn in a rotisserie. Jackie and Mickey are eating their meals
out of polystyrene containers. Rose isn't hungry.)  
JACKIE: And it's gone up market, this place. They're doing little tubs of
coleslaw, now. It's not very nice. It tastes a bit sort of clinical.  
MICKEY: Have you tried that new pizza place down Minto Road?  
JACKIE: What's it selling?  
MICKEY: Pizza.  
JACKIE: That's nice. Do they deliver?  
MICKEY: Yeah.  
JACKIE: Oh, Rose, have something to eat  
ROSE: Two hundred thousand years in the future, he's dying, and there's
nothing I can do.  
JACKIE: Well, like you said two hundred thousand years. It's way off.  
ROSE: But it's not. It's now. That fight is happening right now, and he's
fighting for us, for the whole planet, and I'm just sitting here eating chips.  
JACKIE: Listen to me. God knows I have hated that man, but right now, I love
him and do you know why? Because he did the right thing. He sent you back to
me.  
ROSE: But what do I do every day, mum? What do I do? Get up, catch the bus, go
to work, come back home, eat chips and go to bed? Is that it?  
MICKEY: It's what the rest of us do.  
ROSE: But I can't!  
MICKEY: Why, because you're better than us?  
ROSE: No, I didn't mean that. But it was. It was a better life. And I don't
mean all the travelling and seeing aliens and spaceships and things. That
don't matter. The Doctor showed me a better way of living your life. You know
he showed you too. That you don't just give up. You don't just let things
happen. You make a stand. You say no. You have the guts to do what's right
when everyone else just runs away, and I just can't  
(Rose runs out of the cafe.)

**[Observation deck]**

JACK: Right, Lynda, you are my eyes and ears. When the Daleks get in, you can
follow it on that screen and report it to me.  
LYNDA: Understood.  
JACK: They'll detect you but the door's made of Hydra Combination. It should
keep them out.  
LYNDA: Should?  
JACK: It's the best I can do. How long till the Fleet arrives?  
PAVALE: They've accelerated.  
JACK: This is it, ladies and gentlemen. We are at war!  
(Daleks stream out of the flying saucers towards Game Station. Or Satellite
Five, if you prefer.)

**[Powell Estate]**

MICKEY: You can't spend the rest of your life thinking about the Doctor.  
ROSE: But how do I forget him?  
MICKEY: You've got to start living your own life. You know, a proper life,
like the kind he's never had. The sort of life that you could have with me.  
(Then Rose notices large letters painted on the tarmac of the play area.)  
ROSE: Over here. It's over here as well!  
MICKEY: That's been there for years. It's just a phrase. It's just words.  
ROSE: I thought it was a warning. Maybe it's the opposite. Maybe it's a
message. The same words written down now and two hundred thousand years in the
future. It's a link between me and the Doctor. Bad Wolf here, Bad Wolf there.  
MICKEY: But if it's a message, what's it saying?  
ROSE: It's telling me I can get back. The least I can do is help him escape.

**[Floor 499]**

JACK: Stand your ground, everyone. Follow my commands. And good luck.

**[Observation gallery]**

LYNDA: You were right. They're forcing the airlock on four nine four.  
(The whole satellite shakes, and the Daleks stream in.)

**[Tardis]**

ROSE: All the Tardis needs to do is make a return trip. Just reverse.  
MICKEY: Yeah, but we still can't do it.  
ROSE: The Doctor always said the Tardis was telepathic. This thing is alive.
It can listen.  
MICKEY: It's not listening now, is it?  
ROSE: We need to get inside it. Last time I saw you, with the Slitheen, this
middle bit opened, and there was this light, and the Doctor said it was the
heart of the Tardis. If we can open it, I can make contact. I can tell it what
to do.  
MICKEY: Rose.  
ROSE: Mmm?  
MICKEY: If you go back, you're going to die.  
ROSE: That's a risk I've got to take, because there's nothing left for me
here.  
MICKEY: Nothing?  
ROSE: No.  
MICKEY: Okay, if that's what you think, let's get this thing open.

**[Observation deck]**

JACK [OC]: Okay, activate internal lasers. Slice them up.  
(The Floor Manager does so.)  
LYNDA: Defences have gone offline. The Dalek's have overridden the lot.  
(The Floor Manager and other volunteers start shooting at the approaching
Daleks. The bullets are absorbed into a forcefield around each Dalek.)  
FLOOR MANAGER: You lied to me! The bullets don't work!  
(She gets exterminated.)

**[Tardis]**

(Mickey has fastened a heavy chain to the tow hitch on his Mini. The other end
is fastened to the Tardis console. He drives forward slowly, trying to pull it
open.)  
ROSE: Faster!

**[Powell Estate]**

(Jackie watches as the Mini burns rubber fruitlessly.)  
MICKEY: Come on!  
ROSE: It's not moving!  
(The chain breaks. Rose kicks the console in frustration.)

**[Observation gallery]**

LYNDA: Advance guard have made it

**[Floor 500]**

LYNDA [OC]: To four nine five.  
DOCTOR: Jack

**[Floor 499]**

DOCTOR [OC]: How're we doing?  
JACK: Four nine five should be good. I like four nine five.

**[Floor 495]**

DALEK: Identify yourself!  
ANNE DROID: You are the weakest link. Goodbye!  
(Anne vapourises three Daleks in quick succession.)

**[Floor 499]**

JACK: Yes!

**[Floor 495]**

ANNE DROID: You are the weakest link  
(The next Dalek to enter blows her head off.)  
ANNE DROID: Goodbye.  
DALEK: Proceed to next level.

**[Observation gallery]**

LYNDA: They're flying up the ventilation shafts. No, wait a minute. Oh, my
God. Why're they doing that? They're going down.

**[Floor Zero]**

DALEKS [OC]: Exterminate! Exterminate!  
(The Daleks enter and cause panic.)  
DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate.  
RODRICK: You can't! You don't exist! It's not fair! I won the game! I should
be rich! I'm a winner! You can't do this to me!  
DALEK: Exterminate.

**[Observation gallery]**

(Lynda turns off the sound on the console.)  
LYNDA: Floor Zero. They killed them all.

**[Tardis]**

JACKIE: It was never going to work, sweetheart. And the Doctor knew that. He
just wanted you to be safe.  
ROSE: I can't give up.  
JACKIE: Lock the door. Walk away.  
ROSE: Dad wouldn't give up.  
JACKIE: Well, he's not here, is he? And even if he was, he'd say the same.  
ROSE: No, he wouldn't. He'd tell me to try anything. If I could save the
Doctor's life, try anything.  
JACKIE: Well, we're never going to know.  
ROSE: Well, I know because I met him. I met Dad.  
JACKIE: Don't be ridiculous.  
ROSE: The Doctor took me back in time, and I met Dad.  
JACKIE: Don't say that.  
ROSE: Remember when Dad died? There was someone with him. A girl, a blonde
girl. She held his hand. You saw her from a distance, Mum. You saw her! Think
about it. That was me. You saw me.  
JACKIE: Stop it.  
ROSE: That's how good the Doctor is.  
JACKIE: Stop it! Just stop it!  
(Jackie runs out.)

**[Floor 500]**

DOCTOR: Lynda! What's happening on Earth?

**[Observation deck]**

LYNDA: The Fleet's descending. They're bombing whole continents. Europa,
Pacifica, the New American Alliance. Australasia's just gone.

**[Spaceship]**

EMPEROR: This is perfection. I have created Heaven on Earth.

**[Floor 499]**

JACK: Floor 499, we're the last defence. The bullets should work if you
concentrate them on the Dalek's eyestalk. I've got the forcefield at maximum
so Dalek fire power should be at its weakest.  
PAVALE: I'm only here because of you. I joined the Programme because you were
on it.  
WOMAN: Am I supposed to say, when this is all over and if we're still alive,
maybe we could go for a drink?  
PAVALE: That'd be nice.  
WOMAN: Yeah, well, tough.  
(But she gives him a wink and a smile.)

**[Powell Estate]**

MICKEY: There's got to be something else we can do.  
ROSE: Mum was right. Maybe we should just lock the door and walk away.  
MICKEY: I'm not having that. I'm not having you just, just give up now. No
way. We just need something stronger than my car. Something bigger. Something
like that.  
(A big yellow recovery truck comes round the corner and stops by the Tardis.
Jackie was driving.)  
JACKIE: Right, you've only got this until six o'clock, so get on with it.  
ROSE: Mum, where the hell did you get that from?  
JACKIE: Rodrigo. He owes me a favour. Never mind why, but you were right about
your dad, sweetheart. He was full of mad ideas, and it's exactly what he
would've done. Now, get on with it before I change my mind.  
(Jackie throws the keys to Mickey.)

**[Floor 500]**

JACK: Open fire!  
(The Doctor hears the gunfire and rushes to plug in a massive power cable. The
defenders are firing through slits in pieces of bulkhead.)  
PAVALE: It's not working!  
JACK: Concentrate your fire! Eyestalk, two o'clock!  
DALEK: My vision is impaired! I cannot see!  
WOMAN: We did it!  
(And promptly gets exterminated.)  
PAVALE: No! No!  
(Pavale shows himself, firing over the top of the barricade. Guess what
happens to him.)

**[Observation gallery]**

LYNDA: I've got a problem  
DALEK [OC]: Human female detected.  
LYNDA: They've found me.

**[Floor 500]**

DOCTOR: You'll be all right, Lynda. That side of the station's reinforced
against meteors.

**[Observation gallery]**

LYNDA: Hope so! You know what they say about Earth workmanship.  
(A Dalek with an oxy-acetylene torch instead of sink plunger starts cutting
through the door. Then she turns to see four Daleks rising up outside the big
window. One fires, breaking the glass. Lynda screams, just once.)

**[Floor 500]**

(Jack backs in, firing at Daleks.)  
JACK: Last man standing! For God's sake, Doctor, finish that thing and kill
them!  
EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: Finish that thing and kill mankind.

**[Powell Estate]**

(Once again, Jackie watches as Rose and Mickey use a chain to try and pull the
Tardis console open.)  
ROSE: Keep going!  
JACKIE: Put your foot down!  
ROSE: Faster!  
JACKIE: Give it some more, Mickey!  
ROSE: Keep going!  
JACKIE: Come on, come on!  
ROSE: Keep going!  
JACKIE: Give it some more!  
(The console burst open. Rose looks inside and golden energy streams into her
eyes.)  
MICKEY: Rose!  
(The Tardis doors slam shut on him, and the Tardis dematerialises.)

**[Floor 500]**

JACK: Doctor, you've got twenty seconds maximum!  
(The Tardis hurtles through time, all the time sending energy into Rose.  
Jack runs out of bullets. He throws away the machine gun and takes out a
pistol. Then that too is empty.)  
DALEK: Exterminate.  
JACK: I kind of figured that.  
(The blast throws Jack back into the lift.)  
DOCTOR: It's ready!  
(The Daleks enter from all sides.)  
DOCTOR: You really want to think about this, because if I activate the signal,
every living creature dies.  
EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: I am immortal.  
DOCTOR: Do you want to put that to the test?  
EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: I want to see you become like me. Hail the Doctor,
the Great Exterminator.  
DOCTOR: I'll do it!  
EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: Then prove yourself, Doctor. What are you, coward or
killer?  
(But he cannot throw the final switch.)  
DOCTOR: Coward. Any day.  
EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: Mankind will be harvested because of your weakness.  
DOCTOR: And what about me? Am I becoming one of your angels?  
EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: You are the heathen. You will be exterminated.  
DOCTOR: Maybe it's time.  
(The Doctor closes his eyes, and the Tardis materialises behind him.)  
DALEK: Alert! Tardis materialising!  
EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: You will not escape!  
(The Tardis doors open. Rose is silhouetted in a blinding golden light. Energy
tendrils snake outwards.)  
DOCTOR: What've you done?  
ROSE: I looked into the Tardis, and the Tardis looked into me.  
DOCTOR: You looked into the Time Vortex. Rose, no one's meant to see that.  
EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: This is the Abomination!  
DALEK: Exterminate!  
(Rose stops the beam with her hand.)  
ROSE: I am the Bad Wolf. I create myself. I take the words, I scatter them in
time and space. A message to lead myself here.  
DOCTOR: Rose, you've got to stop this. You've got to stop this now. You've got
the entire vortex running through your head. You're going to burn.  
ROSE: I want you safe. My Doctor. Protected from the false god.  
EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: You cannot hurt me. I am immortal.  
ROSE: You are tiny. I can see the whole of time and space. Every single atom
of your existence, and I divide them.  
(A Dalek disintegrates gently.)  
ROSE: Everything must come to dust. All things. Everything dies. The Time War
ends.  
(The Daleks crumble.)

**[Spaceship]**

EMPEROR: I will not die. I cannot die!  
(The spaceship disappears in a golden wave.)

**[Floor 500]**

DOCTOR: Rose, you've done it. Now stop. Just let go.  
ROSE: How can I let go of this? I bring life.  
(Jack breaths again.)  
DOCTOR: But this is wrong! You can't control life and death.  
ROSE: But I can. The sun and the moon, the day and night. But why do they
hurt?  
DOCTOR: The power's going to kill you and it's my fault.  
ROSE: I can see everything. All that is, all that was, all that ever could be.  
DOCTOR: That's what I see. All the time. And doesn't it drive you mad?  
ROSE: My head.  
DOCTOR: Come here.  
ROSE: It's killing me  
DOCTOR: I think you need a Doctor.  
(The Doctor kisses Rose. The golden energy transfers from her eyes to his,
then she faints in his arms. The Doctor exhales the energy back into the
Tardis and its doors close.  
Jack picks up a handful of Dalek dust from the floor, then runs when he hears
the Tardis engines. He's too late. It dematerialises, leaving him stranded.)

**[Tardis]**

ROSE: What happened?  
DOCTOR: Don't you remember?  
ROSE: It's like there was this singing.  
DOCTOR: That's right. I sang a song and the Daleks ran away.  
ROSE: I was at home. No, I wasn't, I was in the Tardis, and there was this
light. I can't remember anything else  
(The Doctor's skin is darkening.)  
DOCTOR: Rose Tyler. I was going take you to so many places. Barcelona. Not the
city Barcelona, the planet Barcelona. You'd love it. Fantastic place. They've
got dogs with no noses. Imagine how many times a day you end up telling that
joke, and it's still funny.  
ROSE: Then, why can't we go?  
DOCTOR: Maybe you will, and maybe I will. But not like this.  
ROSE: You're not making sense.  
DOCTOR: I might never make sense again. I might have two heads, or no head.
Imagine me with no head. And don't say that's an improvement. But it's a bit
dodgy, this process. You never know what you're going to end up with  
(The Doctor double over in pain.)  
ROSE: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Stay away!  
ROSE: Doctor, tell me what's going on.  
DOCTOR: I absorbed all the energy of the Time Vortex, and no one's meant to do
that. Every cell in my body's dying.  
ROSE: Can't you do something?  
DOCTOR: Yeah, I'm doing it now. Time Lords have this little trick, it's sort
of a way of cheating death. Except it means I'm going to change, and I'm not
going to see you again. Not like this. Not with this daft old face. And before
I go  
ROSE: Don't say that.  
DOCTOR: Rose, before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was I.  
(Golden light burst out of the Doctor's body. This is not a nice quiet
regeneration of the usual kind. Everything changes very suddenly and the tenth
Doctor is standing there. Everyone say Hi! to  David Tennant using a South
London accent instead of his natural Scottish burr.)  
DOCTOR: Hello. Okay. Ooo, new teeth. That's weird. So, where was I? Oh, that's
right. Barcelona.
