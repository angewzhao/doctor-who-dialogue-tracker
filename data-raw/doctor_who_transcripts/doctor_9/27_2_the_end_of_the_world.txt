**The End of the World**  
  
Original Airdate: 2 Apr, 2005  

**[Tardis]**

(Carrying straight on from the last episode. The Doctor and Rose are lit in
green light from the time rotor.)  
DOCTOR: Right then, Rose Tyler, you tell me. Where do you want to go?
Backwards or forwards in time. It's your choice. What's it going to be?  
ROSE: Forwards.  
DOCTOR: How far?  
ROSE: One hundred years.  
(A few seconds of travel.)  
DOCTOR: There you go. Step outside those doors, it's the twenty second
century.  
ROSE: You're kidding.  
DOCTOR: That's a bit boring, though. Do you want to go further?  
ROSE: Fine by me.  
DOCTOR: Ten thousand years in the future. Step outside, it's the year 12005,
the new Roman Empire.  
ROSE: You think you're so impressive.  
DOCTOR: I am so impressive.  
ROSE: You wish.  
DOCTOR: Right then, you asked for it. I know exactly where to go. Hold on!  
(The Tardis zooms down a time vortex.)  
ROSE: Where are we? What's out there?

**[Gallery 15]**

(Rose goes down a flight of steps and a large shutter in the wall descends to
reveal an orbital view of the Earth.)  
DOCTOR: You lot, you spend all your time thinking about dying, like you're
going to get killed by eggs or beef or global warming or asteroids. But you
never take time to imagine the impossible, that maybe you survive. This is the
year five point five slash apple slash twenty six. Five billion years in your
future, and this is the day  
(He looks at his wrist watch.)  
DOCTOR: Hold on.  
(The sun flares and turns red.)  
DOCTOR: This is the day the Sun expands. Welcome to the end of the world.

**[Space]**

(A pair of small spaceships approach a large cruciform space station hanging
in Earth orbit.)  
COMPUTER: Shuttles five and six now docking. Guests are reminded that Platform
One forbids the use of weapons, teleportation and religion. Earth Death is
scheduled for fifteen thirty nine

**[Platform One]**

COMPUTER: Followed by drinks in the Manchester Suite.  
(The Doctor and Rose walk along a corridor.)  
ROSE: So, when it says guests, does that mean people?  
DOCTOR: Depends what you mean by people.  
ROSE: I mean people. What do you mean?  
DOCTOR: Aliens.  
ROSE: What are they doing on board this spaceship? What's it all for?  
DOCTOR: It's not really a spaceship, more like an observation deck. The great
and the good are gathering to watch the planet burn.  
(The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on a wall panel.)  
ROSE: What for?  
DOCTOR: Fun.

**[Observation gallery]**

(A large area with a few display cases and a view of space to the front and
above.)  
DOCTOR: Mind you, when I said the great and the good, what I mean is, the
rich.  
ROSE: But, hold on. They did this once on Newsround Extra. The sun expanding,
that takes hundreds of years.  
DOCTOR: Millions, but the planet's now property of the National Trust. They've
been keeping it preserved. See down there? Gravity satellites holding back the
sun.  
ROSE: The planet looks the same as ever. I thought the continents shifted and
things.  
DOCTOR: They did, and the Trust shifted them back. That's a classic Earth. But
now the money's run out, nature takes over.  
ROSE: How long's it got?  
DOCTOR: About half an hour and then the planet gets roasted.  
ROSE: Is that why we're here? I mean, is that what you do? Jump in at the last
minute and save the Earth?  
DOCTOR: I'm not saving it. Time's up.  
ROSE: But what about the people?  
DOCTOR: It's empty. They're all gone. No one left.  
ROSE: Just me, then.  
(A blue-skinned person with golden slit eyes strides towards them.)  
STEWARD: Who the hell are you?  
DOCTOR: Oh, that's nice, thanks.  
STEWARD: But how did you get in? This is a maximum hospitality zone. The
guests have disembarked. They're on their way any second now.  
DOCTOR: That's me. I'm a guest. Look, I've got an invitation. Look. There, you
see? It's fine, you see? The Doctor plus one. I'm the Doctor, this is Rose
Tyler. She's my plus one. Is that all right?  
(The Doctor puts away the piece of apparently blank paper he was showing to
the steward.)  
STEWARD: Well, obviously. Apologies, et cetera. If you're on board, we'd
better start. Enjoy.  
(The Steward goes over to a lecturn.)  
DOCTOR: The paper's slightly psychic. It shows them whatever I want them to
see. Saves a lot of time.  
ROSE: He's blue.  
DOCTOR: Yeah.  
ROSE: Okay.  
STEWARD: We have in attendance the Doctor and Rose Tyler. Thank you. All staff
to their positions.  
(A lot of small people appear.)  
STEWARD: Hurry, now, thank you. Quick as we can. Come along, come along. And
now, might I introduce the next honoured guest? Representing the Forest of
Cheam, we have trees, namely, Jabe, Lute and Coffa.  
(A bark-skinned woman enters with two larger male escorts.)  
STEWARD: There will be an exchange of gifts representing peace. If you could
keep the room circulating, thank you. Next, from the solicitors Jolco and
Jolco, we have the Moxx of Balhoon.  
(Another blue alien, this time mostly head and body, sitting on a transport
pod.)  
STEWARD: And next, from Financial Family Seven, we have the Adherents of the
Repeated Meme.  
(A group of black-robed bipeds.)  
STEWARD: The inventors of Hypo-slip Travel Systems, the brothers Hop Pyleen.
Thank you.  
(Fur clad reptilians. The announcements of variations on the biped theme
continue.)  
STEWARD: Cal Spark Plug. Mister and Mrs Pakoo. The Ambassadors from the City
State of Binding Light.  
(The trees go up to the Doctor.)  
JABE: The Gift of Peace. I bring you a cutting of my Grandfather.  
(She gives the Doctor a rooted twig in a small pot.)  
DOCTOR Thank you. Yes, gifts. Er, I give you in return air from my lungs.  
(He breathes gently on Jabe.)  
JABE: How intimate.  
DOCTOR: There's more where that came from.  
JABE: I bet there is.  
STEWARD: From the Silver Devastation, the sponsor of the main event, please
welcome the Face of Boe.  
(A large glass case barely makes it through the doorway. It contains a giant
humanoid head with straggly hair and squinting eyes.)  
DOCTOR: The Moxx of Balhoon.  
MOXX: My felicitations on this historical happenstance. I give you the gift of
bodily salivas.  
(Moxx's spit hits Rose in the face.)  
DOCTOR: Thank you very much.  
(The black-robed group glide up.)  
DOCTOR: Ah! The Adherents of the Repeated Meme. I bring you air from my lungs.  
(A large metal hand holds out a ball.)  
ADHERENT: A gift of peace in all good faith.  
STEWARD: And last but not least, our very special guest. Ladies and gentlemen,
and trees and multiforms, consider the Earth below. In memory of this dying
world, we call forth the last Human. The Lady Cassandra O'Brien Dot Delta
Seventeen.  
(A face in a piece of thin skin stretched in a rectangular frame is wheeled in
by two men hidden in top-to-toe hospital whites. She is modelled on, and
voiced by,  Zoe Wanamaker.)  
CASSANDRA: Oh, now, don't stare. I know, I know it's shocking, isn't it? I've
had my chin completely taken away and look at the difference. Look how thin I
am. Thin and dainty. I don't look a day over two thousand. Moisturise me.
Moisturise me.  
(One of her attendants uses a pump spray on the skin.)  
CASSANDRA: Truly, I am the last Human. My father was a Texan, my mother was
from the Arctic Desert. They were born on the Earth and were the last to be
buried in its soil. I have come to honour them and say goodbye. Oh, no tears,
no tears. I'm sorry. But behold, I bring gifts. From Earth itself, the last
remaining ostrich egg. Legend says it had a wingspan of fifty feet and blew
fire from its nostrils. Or was that my third husband? Oh, no. Oh, don't laugh.
I'll get laughter lines. And here, another rarity.  
(Rose has walked round the back of Cassandra to see just how thin she is, and
a 50's juke box is wheeled in.)  
CASSANDRA: According to the archives, this was called an iPod. It stores
classical music from humanity's greatest composers. Play on!  
(One of the little attendants presses a button, a 45 is selected and the
strains of Tainted Love by Soft Cell ring out.)  
STEWARD: Refreshments will now be served. Earth Death in thirty minutes.  
(Rose finally can't take all the aliens, and runs out. The Doctor goes to
follow her, but gets intercepted.)  
JABE: Doctor?  
(Flash! from a device she is holding. A type of camera, presumably.)  
JABE: Thank you.  
ADHERENT: A gift of peace in all good faith.  
STEWARD: No, you're very kind, but I'm just the Steward.  
ADHERENT: A gift of peace in all good faith.  
STEWARD: Well, yes, thank you. Of course.  
(The steward takes the proffered ball. Jabe consults her camera, which
twitters like a bird.)  
JABE: Identify species. Please identify species. Now stop it. Identify his
race. Where's he from? It's impossible.  
(She hurries away. One of the Adherant's gifts has been placed on a shelf in a
display stand. It opens, and a four-legged metal spider scurries away.)

**[Corridor]**

(Rose has wandered off, and is looking at the growing Sun through a window
when a young woman of the same race as the Steward comes round the corner. She
is wearing overalls and a baseball cap.)  
ROSE: Sorry. Am I allowed to be in here?  
RAFFALO: You have to give us permission to talk.  
ROSE: Er, you have permission.  
RAFFALO: Thank you. And, no, you're not in the way. Guests are allowed
anywhere.  
ROSE: Okay.  
(Raffalo goes to a wall panel and unlocks it.)  
ROSE: What's your name?  
RAFFALO: Raffalo.  
ROSE: Raffalo?  
RAFFALO: Yes, miss. I won't be long, I've just got to carry out some
maintenance. There's a tiny little glitch in the Face of Boe's suite. There
must be something blocking the system. He's not getting any hot water.  
ROSE: So, you're a plumber?  
RAFFALO: That's right, miss.  
ROSE: They still have plumbers?  
RAFFALO: I hope so, else I'm out of a job.  
ROSE: Where are you from?  
RAFFALO: Crespallion.  
ROSE: That's a planet, is it?  
RAFFALO: No. Crespallion's part of the Jaggit Brocade, affiliated to the
Scarlet Junction, Convex fifty six. And where are you from, miss? If you don't
mind me asking.  
ROSE: No, not at all. Er, I don't know. A long way away. I just sort of
hitched a lift with this man. I didn't even think about it. I don't even know
who he is. He's a complete stranger. Anyway, don't let me keep you. Good luck
with it.  
RAFFALO: Thank you, miss. And er, thank you for the permission. Not many
people are that considerate.  
ROSE: Okay. See you later.  
(Rose leaves. Raffalo removes the wall panel and has a look inside.)  
RAFFALO: Now then. Control, I'm at junction nineteen and I think the problem's
coming from in here. I'll go inside and have a look.  
(Before she can crawil into the conduit, there is a tapping sound of metal on
metal.)  
RAFFALO: What's that? Is something in there?  
(A metal spider comes towards her.)  
RAFFALO: Oh! Who are you, then?  
(It scuttles away.)  
RAFFALO: Hold on! I if you're an upgrade I just need to register you, that's
all. Oh, come back.  
(She gets inside the conduit.)  
RAFFALO: Ah, there you are. Now, I just need to register your ident. Oh,
there's two of you. Got yourself a little mate. I think I'd better report this
to Control. How many of you are there? What are you? Oh, no, no, no!  
(Raffalo gets dragged along the conduit.)

**[Steward's office]**

(The Steward puts his gift on a side table and sits at his desk. The computer
beeps and burbles at him.)  
STEWARD: What's that? Well, how should I know?  
(He makes a broadcast.)  
STEWARD: Would the owner of the blue box in private gallery fifteen please
report to the Steward�s office immediately. Guests are reminded that use of
teleportation devices is strictly forbidden under Peace Treaty five point four
slash cup slash sixteen. Thank you.  
(The ball hatches another metal spider.)

**[Space]**

COMPUTER: Earth Death in twenty five minutes.

**[Gallery 15]**

(Rose is playing with the ball.)  
COMPUTER: Earth Death in twenty five minutes.  
ROSE: Oh, thanks.  
(She puts the ball down and picks up the plant pot.)  
ROSE: Hello. My name's Rose. That's a sort of plant. We might be related. I'm
talking to a twig.  
(The ball hatches.)

**[Outside Gallery 15]**

(The little assistants are wheeling the Tardis away.)  
DOCTOR: Oi, now, careful with that. Park it properly. No scratches.  
(One of them hands the Doctor a ticket. It says on one side - Have A Nice Day.
A pair of spiders scuttle along the ceiling.)

**[Gallery 15]**

(The spider scans Rose's hand then scuttles away when the Doctor calls out.)  
DOCTOR [OC]: Rose? Are you in there?  
(The Doctor enters.)  
DOCTOR: Aye, aye. What do you think, then?  
ROSE: Great. Yeah, fine. Once you get past the slightly psychic paper. They're
just so alien. The aliens are so alien. You look at 'em and they're alien.  
DOCTOR: Good thing I didn't take you to the Deep South.  
ROSE: Where are you from?  
DOCTOR: All over the place.  
ROSE: They all speak English.  
DOCTOR: No, you just hear English. It's a gift of the Tardis. The telepathic
field, gets inside your brain and translates.  
ROSE: It's inside my brain?  
DOCTOR: Well, in a good way.  
ROSE: Your machine gets inside my head. It gets inside and it changes my mind,
and you didn't even ask?  
DOCTOR: I didn't think about it like that.  
ROSE: No, you were too busy thinking up cheap shots about the Deep South. Who
are you, then, Doctor? What are you called? What sort of alien are you?  
DOCTOR: I'm just the Doctor.  
ROSE: From what planet?  
DOCTOR: Well, it's not as if you'll know where it is!  
ROSE: Where are you from?  
DOCTOR: What does it matter?  
ROSE: Tell me who you are!  
DOCTOR: This is who I am, right here, right now, all right? All that counts is
here and now, and this is me.  
ROSE: Yeah, and I'm here too because you brought me here, so just tell me.  
COMPUTER: Earth Death in twenty minutes. Earth Death in twenty minutes.  
ROSE: All right. As my mate Shareen says, don't argue with the designated
driver.  
(Rose takes out her mobile phone.)  
ROSE: Can't exactly call for a taxi. There's no signal. We're out of range.
Just a bit.  
DOCTOR: Tell you what.  
(He takes her phone apart.)  
DOCTOR: With a little bit of jiggery pokery.  
ROSE: Is that a technical term, jiggery pokery?  
DOCTOR: Yeah, I came first in jiggery pokery. What about you?  
ROSE: No, I failed hullabaloo.  
DOCTOR: Oh. There you go.  
(Rose phones home.)  
JACKIE [OC]: Hello?  
ROSE: Mum?  
JACKIE [OC]: Oh, what is it?

**[The Tyler flat]**

(Jackie is emptying the washing machine.)  
JACKIE: What's wrong? What have I done now? Oh, this red top's falling to
bits.

**[Gallery 15]**

JACKIE [OC]: You should get your money back. Go on.

**[The Tyler flat]**

JACKIE: There must be something, you never phone in the middle of the day.

**[Gallery 15]**

JACKIE [OC]: What's so funny?  
ROSE:: Nothing. You all right, though?

**[The Tyler flat]**

JACKIE: Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

**[Gallery 15]**

ROSE: What day is it?

**[The Tyler flat]**

JACKIE: Wednesday, all day. You got a hangover?

**[Gallery 15]**

JACKIE: Oh, I tell you what. Put a quid in that Lottery syndicate. I'll pay
you back later.  
ROSE: Yeah, er, I was just calling 'cos

**[The Tyler flat]**

ROSE [OC]: I might be late home.  
JACKIE: Is there something wrong?

**[Gallery 15]**

ROSE: No. I'm fine. Top of the world.  
(Jackie rings off.)  
DOCTOR: Think that's amazing, you want to see the bill.  
ROSE: That was five billion years ago. So, she's dead now. Five billion years
later, my mum's dead.  
DOCTOR: Bundle of laughs, you are.  
(The space station shakes.)  
DOCTOR: That's not supposed to happen.

**[Steward's office]**

STEWARD: Well, what was it? I'm just getting green lights at this end.  
(He makes a calm broadcast.)  
STEWARD: Honoured guests may be reassured that gravity pockets may cause
slight turbulence, thanking you.  
(He berates Control.)  
STEWARD: The whole place shook! I felt it. I've hosted all sorts of events on
Platforms One, Three, Six and Fifteen and I've never felt the slightest
tremor. I warn you, if this lot decide to sue. I'm going to scan the
infrastructure.  
(He does so, then hears a scuttling sound.)  
STEWARD: What's that? Control, I don't want to worry you, but I'm picking up
readings. I have no idea. Well, they're small. The scan says they're metal. I
don't know what they look like!  
(Then he sees one on the desk.)  
STEWARD: Although I imagine they might look rather like that. You're not on
the guest list. How did you get on board?  
(The spider pushes a button on his desk keyboard.)  
STEWARD: No.  
COMPUTER: Sun filter deactivated.  
STEWARD: No!  
COMPUTER: Sun filter descending.  
(The room starts to fill with white light from the ceiling downwards as the
filter on the window lowers.)  
STEWARD: No! Sun filter, up! No, no, no!  
COMPUTER: External temperature four thousand degrees.  
STEWARD: Control, respond! Sun filter up! Argh!  
(The spider escapes through a small vent into the corridor.)

**[Observation gallery]**

MOXX: Indubitably, this is the Bad Wolf scenario. I find the inherent laxity
of the on-going multiverse  
(The Doctor and Rose enter.)  
DOCTOR: That wasn't a gravity pocket. I know gravity pockets and they don't
feel like that. What do you think, Jabe? Listened to the engines. They've
pitched up about thirty Hertz. That dodgy or what?  
JABE: It's the sound of metal. It doesn't make any sense to me.  
DOCTOR: Where's the engine room?  
JABE: I don't know, but the maintenance duct is just behind our guest suite, I
could show you and your wife.  
DOCTOR: She's not my wife.  
JABE: Partner?  
DOCTOR: No.  
JABE: Concubine?  
DOCTOR: Nope.  
JABE: Prostitute?  
ROSE: Whatever I am, it must be invisible. Do you mind? Tell you what, you two
go and pollinate. I'm going to catch up with family. Quick word with Michael
Jackson.  
(Rose goes to talk to Cassandra.)  
DOCTOR: Don't start a fight.  
(He offers Jabe his arm.)  
DOCTOR: I'm all yours.  
ROSE: And I want you home by midnight.  
COMPUTER: Earth Death in fifteen minutes. Earth Death in fifteen minutes.

**[Maintenance duct]**

(A multitude of spiders scuttle out of sight behind the swags of wiring and
piping.)  
DOCTOR: Who's in charge of Platform One? Is there a Captain or what?  
JABE: There's just the Steward and the staff. All the rest is controlled by
the metal mind.  
DOCTOR: You mean the computer? But who controls that?  
JABE: The Corporation. They move Platform One from one artistic event to
another.  
DOCTOR: But there's no one from the Corporation on board.  
JABE: They're not needed. This facility is purely automatic. It's the height
of the Alpha class. Nothing can go wrong.  
DOCTOR: Unsinkable?  
JABE: If you like. The nautical metaphor is appropriate.  
DOCTOR: You're telling me. I was on board another ship once. They said that
was unsinkable. I ended up clinging to an iceberg. It wasn't half cold. So,
what you're saying is, if we get in trouble there's no one to help us out?  
JABE: I'm afraid not.  
DOCTOR: Fantastic.  
JABE: I don't understand. In what way is that fantastic?

**[Observation gallery]**

CASSANDRA: Soon, the sun will blossom into a red giant, and my home will die.
That's where I used to live, when I was a little boy, down there. Mummy and
Daddy had a little house built into the side of the Los Angeles Crevice. I'd
have such fun.  
ROSE: What happened to everyone else? The human race, where did it go?  
CASSANDRA: They say mankind has touched every star in the sky.  
ROSE: So, you're not the last human.  
CASSANDRA: I am the last pure human. The others mingled.  
CASSANDRA: Oh, they call themselves New humans and Proto-humans and Digi-
humans, even 'Humanish, but you know what I call them? Mongrels.  
ROSE: Right. And you stayed behind.  
CASSANDRA: I kept myself pure.  
ROSE: How many operations have you had?  
CASSANDRA: Seven hundred and eight. Next week, it's seven hundred and nine.
I'm having my blood bleached. Is that why you wanted a word? You could be
flatter, Rose. You've got a little bit of a chin poking out.  
ROSE: I'd rather die.  
CASSANDRA: Honestly, it doesn't hurt.  
ROSE: No, I mean it. I would rather die. It's better to die than live like
you, a bitchy trampoline.  
CASSANDRA: Oh, well. What do you know.  
ROSE: I was born on that planet, and so was my mum, and so was my dad, and
that makes me officially the last human being in this room, 'cos you're not
human. You've had it all nipped and tucked and flattened till there's nothing
left. Anything human got chucked in the bin. You're just skin, Cassandra.
Lipstick and skin. Nice talking.  
(The Adherants watch Rose leave.)

**[Maintenance duct]**

DOCTOR: So tell me, Jabe, what's a tree like you doing in a place like this?  
JABE: Respect for the Earth.  
DOCTOR: Oh, come on. Everyone on this platform's worth zillions.  
JABE: Well, perhaps it's a case of having to be seen at the right occasions.  
DOCTOR: In case your share prices drop? I know you lot. You've got massive
forests everywhere, roots everywhere, and there's always money in land.  
JABE: All the same, we respect the Earth as family. So many species evolved
from that planet. Mankind is only one. I'm another. My ancestors were
transplanted from the planet down below, and I'm a direct descendant of the
tropical rainforest.  
DOCTOR: Excuse me.  
(He scans a door panel marked Welcome to Platform One. Guide of Platform One
Do You Need Assistance. A keypad labelled Maintenance log in, then Access
denied.)  
JABE: And what about your ancestry, Doctor? Perhaps you could tell a story or
two. Perhaps a man only enjoys trouble when there's nothing else left. I
scanned you earlier. The metal machine had trouble identifying your species.
It refused to admit your existence. And even when it named you, I wouldn't
believe it. But it was right. I know where you're from. Forgive me for
intruding, but it's remarkable that you even exist. I just wanted to say how
sorry I am.  
(She puts her hand on his arm, and the Doctor puts his hand over hers. A tear
drops from his eye. He gets the door open.)

**[Engine room]**

(It runs the whole depth of the Platform. The Doctor and Jabe are by a catwalk
that runs through a series of large fans.)  
DOCTOR: Is it me, or is it a bit nippy?  
(In a corridor, Rose is met by the Adherants, who knock her out by pistol
whipping her with a weapon. They drag her into a room.)  
DOCTOR: Fair do's, though, that's a great bit of air conditioning. Sort of
nice and old fashioned. Bet they call it retro.  
(He scans a panel.)  
DOCTOR: Gotcha.  
(He pulls it off. A spider scuttles out and up the wall.)  
DOCTOR: What the hell's that?  
JABE: Is it part of the retro?  
DOCTOR: I don't think so. Hold on.  
(The Doctor aims his screwdriver at the spider, then Jabe lassoes it.)  
DOCTOR: Hey, nice liana.  
JABE: Thank you. We're not supposed to show them in public.  
DOCTOR: Don't worry, I won't tell anybody. Now then, who's been bringing their
pets on board?  
JABE: What does it do?  
DOCTOR: Sabotage.  
COMPUTER: Earth Death in ten minutes.  
DOCTOR: And the temperature's about to rocket. Come on.  
COMPUTER: Earth Death in ten minutes.

**[Observation gallery]**

CASSANDRA: The planet's end. Come gather, come gather. Bid farewell to the
cradle of civilisation. Let us mourn her with a traditional ballad.  
(The jukebox selects a record labeled Toxic by Britany Spears.)

**[Outside the Steward's office]**

(Smoke from the room is filling the corridor and the glare is coming through a
small glass panel in the door. The little assistants have gathered.)  
DOCTOR: Hold on. Get back.  
(The Doctor does the sonic thing on another small panel.)  
COMPUTER: Sun filter rising. Sun filter rising.  
JABE: Is the Steward in there?!  
DOCTOR: You can smell him. Hold on, there's another sun filter programmed to
descend.  
(He runs off.)

**[Gallery 15]**

COMPUTER: Sun filter descending. Sun filter descending. Sun filter descending.  
(Rose wakes in time to see the deadly glare begin to fill the room. She
hammers on the door.)  
ROSE: Let me out! Let me out!  
COMPUTER: Sun filter descending.

**[Outside gallery 15]**

ROSE: Let me out! Let me out!

**[Gallery 15]**

ROSE: Let me out!  
COMPUTER: Sun filter descending.

**[Outside gallery 15]**

COMPUTER: Sun filter descending.  
(He works the door panel.)  
DOCTOR: Anyone in there?

**[Gallery 15]**

ROSE: Let me out!

**[Outside gallery 15]**

DOCTOR: Oh, well, it would be you.

**[Gallery 15]**

ROSE: Open the door!

**[Outside gallery 15]**

DOCTOR: Hold on. Give us two ticks.

**[Gallery 15]**

(The scorching rays reach the top of the door.)  
COMPUTER: Sun filter descending. Sun filter descending.

**[Outside gallery 15]**

COMPUTER: Sun filter rising. Sun filter rising.

**[Gallery 15]**

COMPUTER: Sun filter rising. Sun filter rising.

**[Outside gallery 15]**

COMPUTER: Sun filter descending.  
DOCTOR: Just what we need.

**[Gallery 15]**

DOCTOR [OC]: The computer's getting clever.  
ROSE: Stop mucking about!

**[Outside gallery 15]**

DOCTOR: I'm not mucking about. It's fighting back.

**[Gallery 15]**

ROSE: Open the door!  
DOCTOR [OC]: I know!  
(Rose runs down the steps away from the glare as it moves down the door.)

**[Outside gallery 15]**

ROSE [OC]: The lock's melted!  
COMPUTER: Sun filter descending. Sun filter

**[Outside gallery 15]**

COMPUTER: Descending. Sun filter rising. Sun filter rising.  
(Rose runs back up to the door.)  
DOCTOR: The whole thing's jammed. I can't open the doors. Stay there!

**[Gallery 15]**

DOCTOR [OC]: Don't move!  
ROSE: Where are am I going to go, Ipswich?  
COMPUTER: Earth Death in five minutes.

**[Observation gallery]**

JABE: The metal machine confirms. The spider devices have infiltrated the
whole of Platform One.  
CASSANDRA: How's that possible? Our private rooms are protected by a code
wall. Moisturise me, moisturise me.  
MOXX: Summon the Steward.  
JABE: I'm afraid the Steward is dead.  
MOXX: Who killed him?  
CASSANDRA: This whole event was sponsored by the Face of Boe. He invited us.
Talk to the Face. Talk to the Face.  
DOCTOR: Easy way of finding out. Someone bought their little pet on board.
Let's send him back to master.  
(The Doctor puts down the spider that Jabe was scanning, and it scuttles off
to Cassandra and scans her, then goes to the black gowned group.)  
CASSANDRA: The Adherents of the Repeated Meme. J'accuse!  
DOCTOR: That's all very well, and really kind of obvious, but if you stop and
think about it  
(He goes over to the Adherants. Their leader tries to hit him, so he pulls of
its arm.)  
DOCTOR: A Repeated Meme is just an idea. And that's all they are, an idea.  
(He pulls one of the wires dangling from the arm, and the Adherants all
collapse.)  
DOCTOR: Remote controlled Droids. Nice little cover for the real troublemaker.
Go on, Jimbo. Go home.  
(The Doctor gives the spider a nudge, and it returns to Cassandra.)  
CASSANDRA: I bet you were the school swot and never got kissed. At arms!  
(Her attendants raise their spray guns.)  
DOCTOR: What are you going to do, moisturise me?  
CASSANDRA: With acid. Oh, you're too late, anyway. My spiders have control of
the mainframe. Oh, you all carried them as gifts, tax free, past every code
wall. I'm not just as pretty face.  
DOCTOR: Sabotaging a ship while you're still inside it? How stupid's that?  
CASSANDRA: I'd hoped to manufacture a hostage situation with myself as one of
the victims. The compensation would have been enormous.  
DOCTOR: Five billion years and it still comes down to money.  
CASSANDRA: Do you think it's cheap, looking like this? Flatness costs a
fortune. I am the last human, Doctor. Me. Not that freaky little kid of yours.  
MOXX: Arrest her, the infidel  
CASSANDRA: Oh, shut it, pixie. I've still got my final option.  
COMPUTER: Earth Death in three minutes.  
CASSANDRA: And here it comes. You're just as useful dead, all of you. I have
shares in your rival companies and they'll triple in price as soon as you're
dead. My spiders are primed and ready to destroy the safety systems. How did
that old Earth song go? Burn, baby, burn.  
JABE: Then you'll burn with us.  
CASSANDRA: Oh, I'm so sorry. I know the use of teleportation is strictly
forbidden, but I'm such a naughty thing. Spiders, activate. (There is a series
of explosions through the Platform.)  
CASSANDRA: Forcefields gone with the planet about to explode. At least it'll
be quick. Just like my fifth husband. Oh, shame on me.  
COMPUTER Safety systems failing.  
CASSANDRA: Bye, bye, darlings. Bye, bye, my darlings.  
(Cassandra and her attendants beam out.)  
COMPUTER: Heat levels rising.  
MOXX: Reset the computer.  
JABE: Only the Steward would know how.  
DOCTOR: No. We can do it by hand. There must be a system restore switch. Jabe,
come on. You lot, just chill.  
COMPUTER: Heat rising.

**[Space]**

COMPUTER: Earth Death in two minutes. Earth Death in two minutes.

**[Maintenance duct]**

COMPUTER: Heat levels critical.

**[Engine room]**

COMPUTER: Heat levels critical.  
DOCTOR: Oh. And guess where the switch is.  
(On the other side of the turning razor sharp fans.)  
COMPUTER: Heat levels rising. Heat levels rising.  
(The Doctor pulls a breaker lever and the fans slow a little, but it resets as
soon as he lets go of it.)  
COMPUTER: External temperature five thousand degrees.  
(Jabe pulls the breaker and holds it down.)  
DOCTOR: You can't. The heat's going to vent through this place.  
JABE: I know.  
DOCTOR: Jabe, you're made of wood.  
JABE: Then stop wasting time, Time Lord.  
COMPUTER: Heat levels rising. Heat levels rising.

**[Observation gallery]**

COMPUTER: Heat levels hazardous.  
(The observation window begins to crack.)  
MOXX: We're going to die!  
COMPUTER: Heat levels hazardous.  
(The Doctor makes it past the first fan.)

**[Gallery 15]**

(The window begins to crack here, too.)  
COMPUTER: Shields malfunction. Shields malfunction. Shields malfunction.  
(Random pieces of deadly glare lance into the room.)

**[Engine room]**

COMPUTER: Heat levels critical. Heat levels critical.  
(The Doctor looks back at Jabe, then times his run past the second fan.  
Glare lances through into the main observation gallery.)  
COMPUTER: Heat levels rising. Heat levels rising.  
(Jabe starts to combust. She lets go of the breaker and the fans speed up to
faster than before until they are just a blur.)  
COMPUTER: Planet explodes in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five  
(The Doctor shuts his eyes and walks past the last fan.)  
COMPUTER: Four.  
(He opens his eyes, realises he is safe and dashes for the reset breaker.)  
DOCTOR: Raise shields!

**[Gallery 15]**

COMPUTER: One.  
(A forcefield envelopes Platform One as the Earth starts to boil, then
explodes.)  
COMPUTER: Exoglass repair. Exoglass repair. Exoglass repair.  
(Rose opens her eyes as the cracks in the window vanish, and she sees the
fractured remains of home floating by.)  
COMPUTER: Exoglass repair.  
(In the engine rooms, the fans have slowed right down for the Doctor to walk
back easily to Jabe's smoking remains.)

**[Observation gallery]**

(Rose enters. The Moxx of Balhoon had got fried by the glare. The Doctor
enters and goes over to the two other trees. He gives them the bad news.)  
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.  
ROSE: You all right?  
DOCTOR: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm full of ideas, I'm bristling with them. Idea
number one, teleportation through five thousand degrees needs some kind of
feed. Idea number two, this feed must be hidden nearby.  
(He smashes open the alleged ostrich egg to reveal a small device.)  
DOCTOR: Idea number three, if you're as clever as me, then a teleportation
feed can be reversed.  
CASSANDRA [OC]: Oh, you should have seen their little alien faces.  
(Cassandra is beamed back in.)  
CASSANDRA: Oh.  
DOCTOR: The last human.  
CASSANDRA: So, you passed my little test. Bravo. This makes you eligible to
join, er, the Human Club.  
DOCTOR: People have died, Cassandra. You murdered them.  
CASSANDRA: It depends on your definition of people, and that's enough of a
technicality to keep your lawyers dizzy for centuries. Take me to court, then,
Doctor, and watch me smile and cry and flutter  
DOCTOR: And creak?  
CASSANDRA: And what?  
DOCTOR: Creak. You're creaking.  
CASSANDRA: What? Ah! I'm drying out! Oh, sweet heavens. Moisturise me,
moisturise me! Where are my surgeons? My lovely boys! It's too hot!  
DOCTOR: You raised the temperature.  
CASSANDRA: Have pity! Moisturise me! Oh, oh, Doctor. I'm sorry. I'll do
anything.  
ROSE: Help her.  
DOCTOR: Everything has its time and everything dies.  
CASSANDRA: I'm too young!  
(Splat!)

**[Space]**

COMPUTER: Shuttles four and six departing. This unit now closing down for
maintenance.

**[Observation gallery]**

(Only Rose and the Doctor are left, looking at the asteroids that were once
the Earth as they float past the red giant Sun.)  
ROSE: The end of the Earth. It's gone. We were too busy saving ourselves. No
one saw it go. All those years, all that history, and no one was even looking.
It's just  
DOCTOR: Come with me.

**[London]**

(A baby cries, a man laughs. The Doctor and Rose stand in the middle of
teeming people going about their daily lives.)  
MAN: Big Issue! Big Issue!  
DOCTOR: You think it'll last forever, people and cars and concrete, but it
won't. One day it's all gone. Even the sky. My planet's gone. It's dead. It
burned like the Earth. It's just rocks and dust before its time.  
ROSE: What happened?  
DOCTOR: There was a war and we lost.  
ROSE: A war with who? What about your people?  
DOCTOR: I'm a Time Lord. I'm the last of the Time Lords. They're all gone. I'm
the only survivor. I'm left travelling on my own 'cos there's no one else.  
ROSE: There's me.  
DOCTOR: You've seen how dangerous it is. Do you want to go home?  
ROSE: I don't know. I want. Oh, can you smell chips?  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Yeah.  
ROSE: I want chips.  
DOCTOR: Me too.  
ROSE: Right then, before you get me back in that box, chips it is, and you can
pay.  
DOCTOR: No money.  
ROSE: What sort of date are you? Come on then, tightwad, chips are on me.
We've only got five billion years till the shops close.
