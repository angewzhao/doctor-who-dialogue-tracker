**The Doctor Dances**  
  
Original Airdate: 28 May, 2005  

**[Albion hospital]**

(The patients are almost within touching distance.)  
DOCTOR: Go to your room.  
(The patients in the ward and the child in the house stand still.)  
DOCTOR: Go to your room. I mean it. I'm very, very angry with you. I am very,
very cross. Go to your room!  
(The child and the patients hang their heads in shame and shuffle away. The
child leaves the Lloyd's house and the patients get back into bed.)  
DOCTOR: I'm really glad that worked. Those would have been terrible last
words.

**[The Lloyd's dining room]**

(From the window, Nancy watches the child walk away down the street.)  
NANCY: Jamie.  
(She sits on the floor and cries.)

**[Albion Hospital ward]**

ROSE: Why are they all wearing gas masks?  
JACK: They're not. Those masks are flesh and bone.  
DOCTOR: How was your con supposed to work?  
JACK: Simple enough, really. Find some harmless piece of space junk, let the
nearest Time Agent track it back to Earth, convince him it's valuable, name a
price. When he's put fifty percent up front, oops! A German bomb falls on it,
destroys it forever. He never gets to see what he's paid for, never knows he's
been had. I buy him a drink with his own money, and we discuss dumb luck. The
perfect self-cleaning con.  
DOCTOR: Yeah. Perfect.  
JACK: The London Blitz is great for self-cleaners. Pompeii's nice if you want
to make a vacation of it though, but you've got to set your alarm for volcano
day. Getting a hint of disapproval.  
DOCTOR: Take a look around the room. This is what your harmless piece of
space-junk did.  
JACK: It was a burnt-out medical transporter. It was empty.  
DOCTOR: Rose.  
ROSE: Are we getting out of here?  
DOCTOR: We're going upstairs.  
JACK: I even programmed the flight computer so it wouldn't land on anything
living. I harmed no-one. I don't know what's happening here, but believe me, I
had nothing to do with it.  
DOCTOR: I'll tell you what's happening. You forgot to set your alarm clock.
It's volcano day.  
(A siren sounds.)  
ROSE: What's that?  
JACK: The all clear.  
DOCTOR: I wish.

**[The Lloyd's hallway]**

(Nancy heads for the back door and is confronted by a boy in a gas mask. He
takes it off.)  
NANCY: I thought you were Jamie.

**[The Lloyd's garden]**

(Nancy runs past him.)  
BOY: Dad! Dad!  
LLOYD: Ruddy kids!  
NANCY: Get off of me! Get your hands off me now!  
(Mister Lloyd man-handles Nancy back inside the house.)  
MRS. LLOYD: Oi, you! Get in! Get her in there. She's nicked!

**[Albion Hospital]**

JACK: Mister Spock?  
ROSE: Doctor?  
(They run past the staircase. The Doctor is the next flight up.)  
DOCTOR: Have you got a blaster?  
JACK: Sure!  
(They run up to join him outside a secure metal door.)  
DOCTOR: The night your space-junk landed, someone was hurt. This was where
they were taken.  
ROSE: What happened?  
DOCTOR: Let's find out. Get it open.  
ROSE: What's wrong with your sonic screwdriver?  
DOCTOR: Nothing.  
(Jack's blaster disintegrates the lock.)  
DOCTOR: Sonic blaster, fifty first century. Weapon Factories of Villengard?  
JACK: You've been to the factories?  
DOCTOR: Once.  
JACK: Well, they gone now, destroyed. The main reactor went critical.
Vaporized the lot.  
DOCTOR: Like I said. Once. There's a banana grove there, now. I like bananas.
Bananas are good.  
ROSE: Nice blast pattern.  
JACK: Digital.  
ROSE: Squareness gun.  
JACK: Yeah.  
ROSE: I like it.

**[Room]**

(Filing cabinets, electronic equipment and a big mess. An observation window
across the room is broken.)  
DOCTOR: What do you think?  
JACK: Something got out of here.  
DOCTOR: Yeah. And?  
JACK: Something powerful. Angry.  
DOCTOR: Powerful and angry.  
(There are child's crayon drawings scattered on the floor and a Steiff teddy
bear.)  
JACK: A child? I suppose this explains Mummy.  
ROSE: How could a child do this?  
(The Doctor turns on a tape machine.)  
CONSTANTINE [OC]: Do you know where you are?  
CHILD [OC]: Are you my mummy?  
CONSTANTINE [OC]: Are you aware of what's around you? Can you see?  
CHILD [OC]: Are you my mummy?  
CONSTANTINE [OC]: What do you want? Do you know  
CHILD [OC]: I want my mummy. Are you my mummy? I want my mummy! Are you my
mummy? Are you my mummy? Mummy? Mummy?  
ROSE: Doctor, I've heard this voice before.  
DOCTOR: Me too.  
CHILD [OC]: Mummy?  
ROSE: Always are you my mummy?. Like he doesn't know.  
CHILD [OC]: Mummy?  
ROSE: Why doesn't he know?  
CHILD: Are you there, mummy? Mummy?

**[The Lloyd's dining room]**

LLOYD: The police are on their way. I pay for the food on this table. The
sweat on my brow, that food is. The sweat on my brow. Anything else you'd
like? I've got a whole house here. Anything else you'd like to help yourself
to?  
NANCY: Yeah. I'd like some wire cutters, please. Something that can cut
through barbed wire. Oh, and a torch. Don't look like that, Mister Lloyd. I
know you've got plenty of tools in here. I've been watching this house for
ages. And I'd like another look round your kitchen cupboards. I was in a hurry
the first time. I want to see if there's anything I missed.  
LLOYD: The food on this table  
NANCY: It's an awful lot of food, isn't it, Mister Lloyd? A lot more than on
anyone else's table. Half this street thinks your missus must be messing about
with Mister Haverstock, the butcher. But she's not, is she? You are. Wire
cutters. Torch. Food. And I'd like to use your bathroom before I leave,
please. Oh, look. There's the sweat on your brow.

**[Room]**

CHILD [OC]: Mummy? Please, mummy? Mummy?  
ROSE: Doctor?  
DOCTOR: Can you sense it?  
JACK: Sense what?  
DOCTOR: Coming out of the walls. Can you feel it?  
CHILD [OC]: Mummy?  
DOCTOR: Funny little human brains. How do you get around in those things?  
ROSE: When he's stressed, he likes to insult species.  
DOCTOR: Rose, I'm thinking.  
ROSE: He cuts himself shaving, he does half an hour on life forms he's
cleverer than.  
DOCTOR: There are these children living rough round the bomb sites. They come
out during air-raids looking for food.  
CHILD [OC]: Mummy, please?  
DOCTOR: Suppose they were there when this thing, whatever it was, landed?  
JACK: It was a med-ship. It was harmless.  
DOCTOR: Yes, you keep saying harmless. Suppose one of them was affected,
altered?  
ROSE: Altered how?  
(The tape runs out.)  
CHILD [OC]: I'm here!  
DOCTOR: It's afraid. Terribly afraid and powerful. It doesn't know it yet, but
it will do. It's got the power of a god, and I just sent it to it's room.  
ROSE: Doctor.  
CHILD [OC]: I'm here. Can't you see me?  
ROSE: What's that noise?  
DOCTOR: End of the tape. It ran out about thirty seconds ago.  
CHILD [OC]: I'm here, now. Can't you see me?  
DOCTOR: I sent it to it's room. This is it's room.  
(The child is there.)  
CHILD: Are you my mummy? Mummy?  
ROSE: Doctor?  
JACK: Okay, on my signal make for the door.  
CHILD: Mummy?  
(Jack aims his blaster at the child. Except it is a banana.)  
JACK: Now!  
CHILD: Mummy?  
(The Doctor pulls Jack's blaster from his belt and makes a nice square hole in
the wall.)  
DOCTOR: Go now! Don't drop the banana!  
JACK: Why not?!  
DOCTOR: Good source of potassium!

**[Albion Hospital]**

JACK: Give me that!  
CHILD: Mummy. I want my mummy.  
(Jack uses his blaster to repair the hole in the wall.)  
JACK: Digital rewind. Nice switch.  
DOCTOR: It's from the groves of Villengard. I thought it was appropriate.  
JACK: There's really a banana grove in the heart of Villengard and you did
that?  
DOCTOR: Bananas are good.  
(The wall starts to crack.)  
ROSE: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Come on!  
(But the patients are coming at them from the other direction.)  
PATIENTS: Mummy. Mummy. Mummy.  
DOCTOR: It's keeping us here till it can get at us.  
JACK: It's controlling them?  
DOCTOR: It is them. It's every living thing in this hospital.  
JACK: Okay. This can function as a sonic blaster, a sonic cannon, and as a
triple-enfolded sonic disrupter. Doc, what you got?  
DOCTOR: I've got a sonic, er. Oh, never mind.  
JACK: What?  
DOCTOR: It's sonic, okay? Let's leave it at that.  
JACK: Disrupter? Cannon? What?  
DOCTOR: It's sonic! Totally sonic! I am soniced up!  
JACK: A sonic what?!  
DOCTOR: Screwdriver!  
(The child breaks through the wall. Rose grabs Jack's blaster and points it at
the floor.)  
ROSE: Going down!

**[Albion Hospital ward 2]**

(Jack repairs the hole in the ceiling.)  
ROSE: Doctor, are you okay?  
DOCTOR: Could've used a warning.  
ROSE: Oh, the gratitude.  
JACK: Who has a sonic screwdriver?  
DOCTOR: I do.  
ROSE: Lights.  
JACK: Who looks at a screwdriver and thinks, ooo, this could be a little more
sonic?  
DOCTOR: What, you've never been bored?  
ROSE: There's got to be a light switch.  
DOCTOR: Never had a long night? Never had a lot of cabinets to put up?  
(Patients sit up in their beds.)  
PATIENTS: Mummy. Mummy.  
JACK: Door.  
(The blaster doesn't work.)  
JACK: Damn it!  
PATIENT: Mummy.  
JACK: It's the special features. They really drain the battery.  
ROSE: The battery?

**[Storeroom]**

(The screwdriver gets them into the storeroom.)  
ROSE: That's so lame!  
JACK: I was going to send for another one, but somebody's got to blow up the
factory.  
ROSE: Oh, I know. First day I met him, he blew my job up. That's practically
how he communicates.  
DOCTOR: Okay, that door should hold it for a bit.  
JACK: The door? The wall didn't stop it!  
DOCTOR: Well, it's got to find us first! Come on, we're not done yet! Assets,
assets!  
JACK: Well, I've got a banana, and in a pinch you could put up some shelves.  
DOCTOR: Window.  
JACK: Barred. Sheer drop outside. Seven stories.  
ROSE: And no other exits.  
JACK: Well, the assets conversation went in a flash, didn't it?  
DOCTOR: So, where'd you pick this one up, then?  
ROSE: Doctor.  
JACK: She was hanging from a barrage balloon, I had an invisible spaceship. I
never stood a chance.  
DOCTOR: Okay. One, we've got to get out of here. Two, we can't get out of
here. Have I missed anything?  
ROSE: Yeah. Jack just disappeared.

**[Nancy's hideout]**

(Jim is using a typewriter when Nancy comes in.)  
NANCY: Thought as much. What are all of you doing here? Different house every
night, I told you.  
JIM: We thought you were dead, or you'd run off.  
ERNIE: I didn't. I knew you'd come back for us.  
(Nancy empties out her sack of loot.)  
ERNIE: Found that old thing in the junk. Thinks he can write now  
JIM: I'm writing a letter to me dad.  
ERNIE: You don't even know where your dad is. And how're you going to send it?  
JIM: I don't know, stick it in an envelope?  
ERNIE: You can't even read or write.  
JIM: I don't need to. I've got a machine.  
NANCY: Will you stop making that noise! I'm sorry, Jim. On you go. You write a
letter to your dad if you want to.  
ERNIE: I know we should've went somewhere else, but we need you, see, for the
thinking.  
NANCY: And what if I wasn't here? What if one night, I didn't come back for
you? There's a war on. People go out they don't always come back. It happens.
What would you do then?  
ERNIE: They're wire cutters.  
NANCY: I need you to think about that. Someone's got to look after this lot.  
ERNIE: Why? Are you going somewhere?  
NANCY: The bomb site. The one at the railway station.  
ERNIE: Why?  
NANCY: The child. That's where he was killed. That's where it all started. And
I'm going to find out how.  
ERNIE: He'll get you, and then he'll come for us. He always comes for us.  
NANCY: No. Ernie, he doesn't. He always comes after me. There are things I
haven't told you. Things I can't tell you. As long as you're with me, you're
in danger. Even now, sitting here, you're in danger because of me.  
ERNIE: You're the one what keeps us safe.  
NANCY: You think so, Ernie? Then answer this. Jim is sitting there right next
to you. So who's typing?  
(The machine finally stops. Nancy takes the paper.)  
ERNIE: Is he coming?  
NANCY: Ernie, as long as you're with me, he's always coming.  
(She throws the paper down.)  
NANCY: Plenty of greens. And chew your food.  
(Nancy leaves. Ernie picks up the paper. Below Jim's gibberish is Are You My
Mummy. Mummy.)

**[Storeroom]**

ROSE: Okay, so he's vanished into thin air. Why is it always the great looking
ones who do that?  
DOCTOR: I'm making an effort not to be insulted.  
ROSE: I mean, men.  
DOCTOR: Okay, thanks, that really helped.  
(The radio crackles into life.)  
JACK [OC]: Rose? Doctor? Can you hear me? I'm back on my ship.

**[Jack's spaceship]**

JACK: Used the emergency teleport. Sorry I couldn't take you.

**[Storeroom]**

JACK [OC]: It's security-keyed to my molecular structure.

**[Jack's spaceship]**

JACK: I'm working on it. Hang in there.  
DOCTOR [OC]: How're you speaking

**[Storeroom]**

DOCTOR: To us?  
JACK [OC]: Om-Com. I can call anything with a speaker grill.  
DOCTOR: Now there's a coincidence.  
JACK [OC]: What is?  
DOCTOR: The child can Om-Com, too.  
ROSE: He can?  
DOCTOR: Anything with a speaker grill. Even the Tardis phone.  
ROSE: What, you mean the child can phone us?  
CHILD [OC]: And I can hear you. Coming to find you. Coming to find you.

**[Jack's spaceship]**

JACK: Doctor, can you hear that?  
DOCTOR [OC]: Loud and clear.  
JACK: I'll try to block out the signal. Least I can do.

**[Storeroom]**

CHILD [OC]: Coming to find you, mummy.

**[Jack's spaceship]**

JACK: Remember this one, Rose?

**[Storeroom]**

(Moonlight Serenade comes through the radio.)  
ROSE: Our song.  
(Meanwhile, Nancy has made it to Limehouse Green and is cutting the barbed
wire.  
A little later, Rose is relaxing in a wheelchair while the Doctor is at the
barred window with the ever-versatile sonic screwdriver.)  
ROSE: What you doing?  
DOCTOR: Trying to set up a resonation pattern in the concrete, loosen the
bars.  
ROSE: You don't think he's coming back, do you?  
DOCTOR: Wouldn't bet my life.  
ROSE: Why don't you trust him?  
DOCTOR: Why do you?  
ROSE: He saved my life. Bloke-wise, that's up there with flossing. I trust him
because he's like you. Except with dating and dancing. What?  
DOCTOR: You just assume I'm  
ROSE: What?  
DOCTOR: You just assume that I don't dance.  
ROSE: What, are you telling me you do dance?  
DOCTOR: Nine hundred years old, me. I've been around a bit. I think you can
assume at some point I've danced.  
ROSE: You?  
DOCTOR: Problem?  
ROSE: Doesn't the universe implode or something if you dance?  
DOCTOR: Well, I've got the moves but I wouldn't want to boast.  
(Rose turns up the volume on the radio. It is still Moonlight Serenade.)  
ROSE: You've got the moves? Show me your moves.  
DOCTOR: Rose, I'm trying to resonate concrete.  
ROSE: Jack'll be back. He'll get us out. So come on. The world doesn't end
because the Doctor dances.  
(Rose holds out her hands, and the Doctor looks at her palms.)  
DOCTOR: Barrage balloon?  
ROSE: What?  
DOCTOR: You were hanging from a barrage balloon.  
ROSE: Oh, yeah. About two minutes after you left me. Thousands of feet above
London, middle of a German air-raid, Union Jack all over my chest.  
DOCTOR: I've travelled with a lot of people, but you're setting new records
for jeopardy friendly.  
ROSE: Is this you dancing? Because I've got notes.  
DOCTOR: Hanging from a rope thousands feet above London. Not a cut, not a
bruise.  
ROSE: Yeah, I know. Captain Jack fixed me up.  
DOCTOR: Oh, we're calling him Captain Jack now, are we?  
ROSE: Well, his name's Jack and he's a Captain.  
DOCTOR: He's not really a Captain, Rose.  
ROSE: Do you know what I think? I think you're experiencing Captain envy.
You'll find your feet at the end of your legs. You may care to move them.  
DOCTOR: If ever he was a Captain, he's been defrocked.  
ROSE: Yeah? Shame I missed that.

**[Jack's spaceship]**

JACK: Actually, I quit. Nobody takes my frock. Most people notice when they've
been teleported. You guys are so sweet. Sorry about the delay. I had to take
the nav-com offline to override the teleport security.  
DOCTOR: You can spend ten minutes overriding your own protocols? Maybe you
should remember whose ship it is.  
JACK: Oh, I do. She was gorgeous. Like I told her, be back in five minutes.  
DOCTOR: This is a Chula ship.  
JACK: Yeah, just like that medical transporter. Only this one is dangerous.  
(The Doctor snaps his fingers and the golden glow envelopes his hands.)  
ROSE: They're what fixed my hands up Jack called them er  
DOCTOR: Nanobots? Nanogenes.  
ROSE: Nanogenes, yeah.  
DOCTOR: Sub-atomic robots. There's millions of them in here, see? Burned my
hand on the console when we landed. All better now. They activate when the
bulk head's sealed. Check you out for damage, fix any physical flaws. Take us
to the crash site. I need to see your space junk.  
JACK: As soon as I get the nav-com back online. Make yourself comfortable.
Carry on with whatever it was you were doing.  
DOCTOR: We were talking about dancing.  
JACK: It didn't look like talking.  
ROSE: It didn't feel like dancing.

**[Bomb site]**

(Nancy makes her way to the tarpaulin covered spacecraft. Just as she starts
to pull it back, the spotlights come on and rifles are pointed at her.)  
SOLDIER: Halt! Don't move!

**[Jack's spaceship]**

ROSE: So, you used to be a Time Agent now you're trying to con them?  
JACK: If it makes me sound any better, it's not for the money.  
ROSE: For what?  
JACK: Woke up one day when I was still working for them, found they'd stolen
two years of my memories. I'd like them back.  
ROSE: They stole your memories?  
JACK: Two years of my life. No idea what I did. Your friend over there doesn't
trust me, and for all I know he's right not to. Okay, we're good to go. Crash
site?

**[Bomb site HQ]**

(Nancy is escorted in. An unwell soldier tries to stand up.)  
ALGY: As you were. Feeling any better?  
JENKINS: Just a touch, sir.  
ALGY: Chain her up where Jenkins can keep an eye on her.  
NANCY: No, not in here. Not with him.  
(Nancy has spotted the scar on Jenkins' hand. She is handcuffed a chain
wrapped around the table leg and sat in a chair opposite him.)  
ALGY: You shouldn't have broken in here if you didn't want to stay.  
NANCY: You don't understand. Not with him.  
ALGY: This is a restricted area, miss. You can just sit here for a bit. We're
going to have to ask you a few questions.  
SOLDIER: Found these, sir.  
(The bolt cutters.)  
ALGY: Very professional. A little bit too professional. Didn't just drop in by
accident then, did you?  
NANCY: My little brother died here. I wanted to find out what killed him.  
ALGY: Take the men, check the fence for any other breaches and search the
area. She may not have come here alone.  
SOLDIER: Yes, sir.  
NANCY: Please! Listen, you can't leave me here.  
ALGY: Watch her, Jenkins.  
JENKINS: Yes, Mummy.  
ALGY: Jenkins? Sorry, sir. I don't know what's the matter with me.  
NANCY: Look, lock me up, fine, but not here. Please, anywhere but here!  
(Algy leaves.)  
JENKINS: You'll be all right, miss. I'm just a little. Just a little, just a
little. What's the matter with you?  
NANCY: Please, let me go.  
JENKINS: Why would I do that?  
NANCY: Because you've got a scar on the back of your hand.  
JENKINS: Well, yes, but I don't see what that's got to do with anything.  
NANCY: And you feel like you're going to be sick, like something's forcing its
way up your throat. I know because I've seen it before.  
JENKINS: What's happening to me?  
NANCY: In a minute, you won't be you anymore. You won't even remember you. And
unless you let me go, it's going to happen to me too. Please.  
JENKINS: What're you talking about?  
NANCY: What's your mother's name?  
JENKINS: Matilda.  
NANCY: You got a wife?  
JENKINS: Yes.  
NANCY: Wife's name? You got kids? What's your name? Please, let me go. It's
too late for you. I'm sorry, but please let me go.  
JENKINS: What do you mmmmm. Mummy.

**[Limehouse Green]**

JACK: There it is. Hey, they've got Algy on duty. It must be important.  
DOCTOR: We've got to get past him.  
ROSE: Are the words distract the guard heading in my general direction?  
JACK: I don't think that'd be such a good idea.  
ROSE: Don't worry I can handle it.  
JACK: I've got to know Algy quite well since I've been in town. Trust me,
you're not his type. I'll distract him. Don't wait up.  
DOCTOR: Relax, he's a fifty first century guy. He's just a bit more flexible
when it comes to dancing.  
ROSE: How flexible?  
DOCTOR: Well, by his time, you lot have spread out across half the galaxy.  
ROSE: Meaning?  
DOCTOR: So many species, so little time.  
ROSE: What, that's what we do when we get out there? That's our mission? We
seek new life, and, and  
DOCTOR: Dance.

**[Bomb site]**

JACK: Hey, tiger. How's it hanging?  
ALGY: Mummy?  
JACK: Algy, old sport, it's me.  
ALGY: Mummy?  
JACK: It's me, Jack.  
ALGY: Jack? Are you my mummy?  
(Algy starts to retch, then falls to his knees before his face turns into a
gas mask. Rose and the Doctor run forward from the sidings.)  
DOCTOR: Stay back!  
JACK: You men, stay away!  
DOCTOR: The effect's become air-borne, accelerating.  
(The air raid sirens start up.)  
ROSE: What's keeping us safe?  
DOCTOR: Nothing.  
JACK: Ah, here they come again.  
ROSE: All we need. Didn't you say a bomb was going to land here?  
DOCTOR: Never mind about that. If the contaminants airborne now, there's hours
left.  
JACK: For what?  
DOCTOR: Till nothing, forever. For the entire human race. And can anyone else
hear singing?  
NANCY [OC]: Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree tops.

**[Bomb site HQ]**

(Jenkins is fully transformed and slumped across the table.)  
NANCY: When the wind blows, the cradle will rock. When the bough breaks, the
cradle will fall. Down will come baby, cradle and all.  
(The Doctor enters and gestures to her to keep singing.)  
NANCY: Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree tops. When the wind blows the cradle will
rock.  
(The Doctor frees her from the handcuffs.)

**[Bomb site]**

(They light up and uncover the spacecraft.)  
JACK: You see? Just an ambulance.  
NANCY: That's an ambulance?  
ROSE: It's hard to explain. It's from another world.  
JACK: They've been trying to get in.  
DOCTOR: Of course they have. They think they've got their hands on Hitler's
latest secret weapon. What're you doing?  
(Jack is keying in the access codes.)  
JACK: The sooner you see this thing is empty, the sooner you'll know I had
nothing to do with it.  
(Bang! Sparks, and an alarm. The access panel has a red flashing light.)  
JACK: Didn't happen last time.  
DOCTOR: It hadn't crashed last time. There'll be emergency protocols.  
ROSE: Doctor, what is that?

**[Albion Hospital]**

CHILD: Mummy?  
(All the patients get up.)

**[Bomb site]**

(The patients start battering at the hospital doors.)  
ROSE: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Captain, secure those gates!  
JACK: Why?  
DOCTOR: Just do it! Nancy, how'd you get in here?  
NANCY: I cut the wire.  
DOCTOR: Show Rose. Setting two thousand four hundred and twenty eight D.  
(The Doctor throws Rose the sonic screwdriver.)  
ROSE: What?  
DOCTOR: Reattaches barbed wire. Go!

**[Bomb site fence]**

(As the patients leave the hospital, Rose mends the cuts in the barbed wire.
Bombs fall on London again.)  
NANCY: Who are you? Who are any of you?  
ROSE: You'd never believe me if I told you.  
NANCY: You just told me that was an ambulance from another world. There are
people running around with gas mask heads calling for their mummies, and the
sky's full of Germans dropping bombs on me. Tell me, do you think there's
anything left I couldn't believe?  
ROSE: We're time travellers from the future.  
NANCY: Mad, you are.  
ROSE: We have a time travel machine. seriously!  
NANCY: It's not that. All right, you've got a time travel machine. I believe
you. Believe anything, me. But what future?  
ROSE: Nancy, this isn't the end. I know how it looks, but it's not the end of
the world or anything  
NANCY: How can you say that?? Look at it.  
ROSE: Listen to me. I was born in this city. I'm from here, in like, fifty
years time.  
NANCY: From here?  
ROSE: I'm a Londoner. From your future.  
NANCY: But, but you're not  
ROSE: What?  
NANCY: German.  
ROSE: Nancy, the Germans don't come here. They don't win. Don't tell anyone I
told you so, but you know what? You win.  
NANCY: We win?  
ROSE: Come on!

**[Bomb site]**

(Jack gets the ambulance open.)  
JACK: It's empty. Look at it.  
DOCTOR: What do you expect in a Chula medical transporter? Bandages? Cough
drops? Rose?  
ROSE: I don't know.  
DOCTOR: Yes, you do.  
ROSE: Nanogenes!  
DOCTOR: It wasn't empty, Captain. There was enough nanogenes in there to
rebuild a species.  
JACK: Oh, God.  
DOCTOR: Getting it now, are we? When the ship crashes, the nanogenes escape.
Billions upon billions of them, ready to fix all the cuts and bruises in the
whole world. But what they find first is a dead child, probably killed earlier
that night, and wearing a gasmask.  
ROSE: And they brought him back to life? They can do that?  
DOCTOR: What's life? Life's easy. A quirk of matter. Nature's way of keeping
meat fresh. Nothing to a nanogene. One problem, though. These nanogenes,
they're not like the ones on your ship. This lot have never seen a human being
before. Don't know what a human being's supposed to look like. All they've got
to go on is one little body, and there's not a lot left. But they carry right
on. They do what they're programmed to do. They patch it up. Can't tell what's
gasmask and what's skull, but they do their best. Then off they fly, off they
go, work to be done. Because, you see, now they think they know what people
should look like, and it's time to fix all the rest. And they won't ever stop.
They won't ever, ever stop. The entire human race is going to be torn down and
rebuilt in the form of one terrified child looking for its mother, and nothing
in the world can stop it!  
JACK: I didn't know.  
(The Doctor works on the ambulance while the patients approach.)  
PATIENTS: Mummy. Mummy.  
NANCY: Rose!  
ROSE: It's bringing the gas mask people here, isn't it?  
DOCTOR: The ship thinks it's under attack. It's calling up the troops.
Standard protocol.  
ROSE: But the gas mask people aren't troops.  
DOCTOR: They are now. This is a battle-field ambulance. The nanogenes don't
just fix you up, they get you ready for the front line. Equip you, programme
you.  
ROSE: That's why the child's so strong. Why it could do that phoning thing.  
DOCTOR: It's a fully equipped Chula warrior, yes. All that weapons tech in the
hands of a hysterical four year old looking for his mummy. And now there's an
army of them.  
(The patients surround them, outside the barbed wire.)  
JACK: Why don't they attack?  
DOCTOR: Good little soldiers, waiting for their commander.  
JACK: The child?  
NANCY: Jamie.  
JACK: What?  
NANCY: Not the child. Jamie.  
ROSE: So how long until the bomb falls?  
JACK: Any second.  
DOCTOR: What's the matter, Captain? A bit close to the volcano for you?  
NANCY: He's just a little boy.  
DOCTOR: I know.  
NANCY: He's just a little boy who wants his mummy.  
DOCTOR: I know. There isn't a little boy born who wouldn't tear the world
apart to save his mummy. And this little boy can.  
ROSE: So what're we going to do?  
DOCTOR: I don't know.  
NANCY: It's my fault.  
DOCTOR: No.  
NANCY: It is. It's all my fault.  
DOCTOR: How can it be your  
PATIENTS: Mummy. Mummy. Mummy. Mummy.  
DOCTOR: Nancy, what age are you? Twenty? Twenty one? Older than you look, yes?  
(The bombs get closer.)  
JACK: Doctor, that bomb. We've got seconds.  
ROSE: You can teleport us out.  
JACK: Not you guys. The nav-com's back online. Going to take too long to
override the protocols.  
DOCTOR: So it's volcano day. Do what you've got to do.  
ROSE: Jack?  
(Jack vanishes.)  
DOCTOR: How old were you five years ago? Fifteen? Sixteen? Old enough to give
birth, anyway. He's not your brother, is he? A teenage single mother in 1941.
So you hid. You lied. You even lied to him.  
(The bomb site gate opens and Jamie stands there.)  
CHILD: Are you my mummy?  
DOCTOR: He's going to keep asking, Nancy. He's never going to stop.  
CHILD: Mummy?  
DOCTOR: Tell him. Nancy, the future of the human race is in your hands. Trust
me and tell him.  
(Nancy and Jamie walk towards each other.)  
CHILD: Are you my mummy? Are you my mummy? Are you my mummy?  
NANCY: Yes. Yes, I am your mummy.  
CHILD: Mummy?  
NANCY: I'm here.  
CHILD: Are you my mummy?  
NANCY: I'm here.  
CHILD: Are you my mummy?  
NANCY: Yes.  
CHILD: Are you my mummy?  
DOCTOR: He doesn't understand. There's not enough of him left.  
NANCY: I am your mummy. I will always be your mummy. I'm so sorry. I am so, so
sorry.  
(Nancy hugs Jamie and a cloud of nanogenes surround them.)  
ROSE: What's happening? Doctor, it's changing her, we should  
DOCTOR: Shush! Come on, please. Come on, you clever little nanogenes. Figure
it out! The mother, she's the mother. It's got to be enough information.
Figure it out.  
ROSE: What's happening?  
DOCTOR: See? Recognising the same DNA.  
(Jamie lets go and Nancy falls on the ground.)  
DOCTOR: Oh, come on. Give me a day like this. Give me this one.  
(The Doctor removes Jamie's gas mask.)  
DOCTOR: Ha-ha! Welcome back! Twenty years till pop music - you're going to
love it.  
NANCY: What happened?  
DOCTOR: The nanogenes recognised the superior information, the parent DNA.
They didn't change you because you changed them! Ha-ha! Mother knows best!  
NANCY: Oh, Jamie.  
ROSE: Doctor, that bomb.  
DOCTOR: Taken care of it.  
ROSE: How?  
DOCTOR: Psychology.  
(The bomb hurtles towards them, and gets caught in Jack's light beam just
before impact. Jack is sitting astride the bomb.)  
JACK: Doctor!  
DOCTOR: Good lad!  
JACK: The bomb's already commenced detonation. I've put it in stasis but it
won't last long.  
DOCTOR: Change of plan. Don't need the bomb. Can you get rid of it, safely as
you can?  
JACK: Rose?  
ROSE: Yeah?  
JACK: Goodbye.  
(Jack and the bomb vanish then reappear.)  
JACK: By the way, love the tee-shirt.  
(And vanishes again. The spaceship sucks up the light beam and flies off. The
Doctor summons some nanogenes to himself.)  
ROSE: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Software patch. Going to email the upgrade. You want moves, Rose? I'll
give you moves.  
(He throws the nanogenes to the waiting patients, who fall to the ground..)  
DOCTOR: Everybody lives, Rose. Just this once, everybody lives!  
(The patients stand up again, back to normal.)  
DOCTOR: Doctor Constantine. Who never left his patients. Back on your feet,
constant doctor. The world doesn't want to get by without you just yet, and I
don't blame it one bit. These are your patients. All better now.  
CONSTANTINE: Yes, yes, so it seems. They also seem to be standing around in a
disused railway station. Is there any particular reason for that?  
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, you know, cutbacks. Listen, whatever was wrong with them
in the past, you're probably going to find that they're cured. Just tell them
what a great doctor you are. Don't make a big thing of it. Okay?  
(The Doctor leaves them and an old woman hobbles up.)  
HARCOURT: Doctor Constantine.  
CONSTANTINE: Mrs Harcourt. How much better you're looking.  
HARCOURT: My leg's grown back. When I come to the hospital, I had one leg.  
CONSTANTINE: Well, there is a war on. Is it possible you miscounted?  
DOCTOR: Right, you lot. Lots to do. Beat the Germans, save the world. Don't
forget the welfare state! Setting this to self-destruct, soon as everybody's
clear. History says there was an explosion here. Who am I to argue with
history?  
ROSE: Usually the first in line.

**[Tardis]**

DOCTOR: The nanogenes will clean up the mess and switch themselves off,
because I just told them to. Nancy and Jamie will go to Doctor Constantine for
help, ditto. All in all, all things considered, fantastic!  
ROSE: Look at you, beaming away like you're Father Christmas.  
DOCTOR: Who says I'm not, red bicycle when you were twelve?  
ROSE: What?  
DOCTOR: And everybody lives, Rose! Everybody lives! I need more days like
this.  
ROSE: Doctor.  
DOCTOR: Go on, ask me anything. I'm on fire.  
ROSE: What about Jack? Why'd he say goodbye?

**[Jack's spaceship]**

JACK: Okay, computer, how long can we keep the bomb in stasis?  
COMPUTER: Stasis decaying at ninety percent cycle. Detonation in three
minutes.  
JACK: Can we jettison it?  
COMPUTER: Any attempt to jettison the device will precipitate detonation. One
hundred percent probability.  
JACK: We could stick it in an escape pod.  
COMPUTER: There is no escape pod on board.  
JACK: I see the flaw in that. I'll get in the escape pod.  
COMPUTER: There is no escape pod on board.  
JACK: Did you check everywhere?  
COMPUTER: Affirmative.  
JACK: Under the sink?  
COMPUTER: Affirmative.  
JACK: Okay. Out of one hundred, exactly how dead am I?  
COMPUTER: Termination of Captain Jack Harkness in under two minutes. One
hundred percent probability.  
JACK: Lovely. Thanks. Good to know the numbers.  
COMPUTER: You're welcome.  
JACK: Okay then. Think we'd better initiate emergency protocol four one seven.  
COMPUTER: Affirmative.  
(A martini appears. Jack drinks it.)  
JACK: Oo, a little too much vermouth. See if I come here again. Funny thing.
Last time I was sentenced to death, I ordered four hyper-vodkas for my
breakfast. All a bit of a blur after that. Woke up in bed with both my
executioners. Mmm, lovely couple. They stayed in touch. Can't say that about
most executioners. Anyway. Thanks for everything, computer. It's been great.  
(Moonlight Serenade plays. Jack looks down the spaceship and through the open
doors of the Tardis, where the Doctor and Rose are dancing.)

**[Tardis]**

ROSE: Well, hurry up then!  
(Jack runs in.)  
ROSE: Okay. And right and turn. Okay, okay, try and spin me again, but this
time don't get my arm up my back. No extra points for a half-nelson.  
DOCTOR: I'm sure I used to know this stuff. Close the door, will you? Your
ship's about to blow up. There's going to be a draught.  
(Jack shuts the door and the Doctor starts up the engine.)  
DOCTOR: Welcome to the Tardis.  
JACK: Much bigger on the inside.  
DOCTOR: You'd better be.  
ROSE: I think what the Doctor's trying to say is you may cut in.  
DOCTOR: Rose! I've just remembered!  
ROSE: What?  
(The music changes from waltz to swing - Glenn Miller's In The Mood.)  
DOCTOR: I can dance! I can dance!  
ROSE: Actually, Doctor, I thought Jack might like this dance.  
DOCTOR: I'm sure he would, Rose. I'm absolutely certain. But who with?  
(Rose dances with the Doctor while Jack watches. This style he can do, and
Rose loves it when he dips her.)
